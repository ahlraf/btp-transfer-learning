"I don't know how to function in this world anymore. I used to be driven by my anxiety to get assignments submitted, and now I can barely complete them, and always at the expense of my own sanity and self-worth. I am a college English major and writing was my passion, but now I freeze and my mind goes blank and I cannot respond to the paper prompts I have weighing over my head. What little I can get written, I turn in at the last minute (2 pages for a 6 page paper that was due tonight; low-caliber work). I feel so empty and I don't know if I can pull myself together and try again, only to fail and fall even harder than before. I'm deeply Catholic so I will never bring harm to myself or my loved ones by taking my own life... still, I fear the thought of failure more than anything in this world, and I don't know how to stop it from consuming my life. I don't know if anyone can relate, or has something to say, but I seriously needed to put out my thoughts somewhere to keep them from suffocating me. ",1,1,0,0

"For the last year I feel like b/p is just a really wimpy muscle that I trained to be a ripped bicep - like it’s just a hobby at this point. My mom left for a doctors appointment and instead of getting chores done I found anything I could eat in the house to get a quick dopamine fix. Restricting? Binge. Sad? Binge. Bored? Binge. I’m not working at the moment, (F21) because of how bad it’s gotten. I do a lot of side hustles but usually that money goes straight to binge food. I have severe social anxiety and I wish I had friends and a life but I’m too scared to leave the house most of the time cause I’m so fixated on my body. ",1,1,0,0

"I've been trying to get a job for months now. I graduated high school in 2022 and have been sitting at home helping my mom with daily chores ever since because I can hardly leave my house. It's making me depressed cuz I don't do anything and all my friends are off at college, working etc. I tried filling out an application to a local grocery store but now it's just sitting on my desk. I tried to take it in yesterday but I had like 3 panic attacks. I feel miserable, and I don't know what to do. I know people are just gonna tell me to do it anyways but it isn't that simple. I've gone through multiple jobs that have lasted only a couple days at most. Even in high school I had to skip weeks at a time because of how bad my anxiety would get. It's not like I can just leave a job when things get unbearable. I feel trapped at a job; if I get a panic attack (which happens more than once a day), I can't just leave and calm down. ",1,1,0,0

"I’ve had a best friend for 4 years now, we did everything together and kinda still do but lately I’ve been feeling abandoned. She hangs out with her work friends a lot more and has been getting closer to them, she goes out drinking with them a lot but always says no to me and says she isn’t feeling it. I can’t help but feel pushed aside, it literally makes me so upset whenever I see her stories of her out with her new work friends because I feel like she’s been hanging out with them more than me. I know it’s selfish but I can’t help it. I literally wanted to block her the other day when she posted a story of her out with one of them.

I feel so hopeless I haven’t felt this hopeless since middle school. I just don’t know what to do. Gf dumped me probably cuz I gain lose weight so fast and I’m crazy and I get it. I’m even thinking of going back to OA and 12 step meetings because I just don’t have anywhere else to go. I hated it though. They made me feel even more hopeless and like I haven’t hit bottom yet and there’s nothing I can do until I hit that bottom or whatever else that needs to happen for my ego to finally “surrender” but guess what?

"You aren’t your thoughts. You just experience them. Just like how we have mental illness, but we aren’t the illness. It’s a disease just like cancer. You don’t see cancer patients saying “I am cancer”. They say “I have cancer.” Everyone is different but I think saying “I’m bipolar” makes it seem like I’m saying that it’s my identity. I remind myself all the time that bipolar is not my identity, its just a journey that I’m on. A journey that is different than anyone else’s. ",1,0,0,0
"Basically what the title says. I just feel sad. I spent the last couple of days in constant anxiety due to the environment we are in atm. It was mostly like I was in tranz where all I was thinking about was how to survive. It got so bad, I started to get hallucinations in the middle of the night and hear and see stuff that just freaked me even more out. Additionally, I was completely shut off from the rest of the system and couldn't communicate with anyone at all. Right now it got better and I get to talk with some other alters again and apperently there were switches. But I'm still feeling sad. I just want to live a normal life and not have to deal with this all. I never asked for this and now I feel stuck. We won't have a normal life at any point and Ig that's smth that makes me the most depressed. I ended up self harming yesterday and it felt like I was in a backseat and someone else was doing it actually. But I didn't mind it at the time, I just wanted to have smth where I could relieve some of the pain I feel. I just wish everything could stop for a second.",1,1,0,0
"My therapist that I’ve been seeing for the past year seems to think that I have DID. She has explained the possible symptoms to me, which some I can resonate with. I am diagnosed with PTSD among other things, and thought that I would only dissociate when triggered. Is it possible to be diagnosed with DID, but not be aware of the other alters? I’m not too sure if I should believe her professional opinion. Would love to hear what you all have to say. Thank you! ",1,0,0,0

I was so depressed and even at times I would freak out and yell at my managers. Idk I was told that I made people feel like they were walking on egg shells. I think even now after being diagnosed I still don’t feel okay because lately I been in this depression because I lost a lot. Idk during that time before my ex broke up with me I felt suicidal every day and I was scared to tell her how I felt. Even now I feel the same way.

"I’m 35 and I just recently attempted suicide and was admitted to a behavioral health hospital for 4 days. They got me stabilized and took me off my antidepressant because it causes mania and put me on Depakote to stabilize my moods. I got home and my husband only told me I’ve ruined his life, my life, and our daughter’s life. She’s 10 and it’s clear she also has bipolar disorder. It runs in my family. My grandma had it and tried to end her life around my age too. My mother the same thing. Now me. I know this is my daughters future. My husband says I’m not ever going to get better because I just don’t get it. I do get it but I can’t help it. Now my job is making me go on medical leave while I am going through outpatient and I don’t know how I’m going to afford to live. I’m supposed to resume college classes tomorrow and I have to get a B or higher or I’ll lose my financial aid. Meanwhile my husband says he can’t parent with me and that he hates me. I CAN’T DO THIS! I’ve suffered through 35 years of this misery. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. None of my family will help me and they all live scattered across the country and none of them are near me except my sister but she hates me.

So to put it shorts I’ve been going through and anxious stage for two months panic attack a bit better a day or so then panic again. Anyway today I’ve had my moments where I’ve felt a bit on edge. My main symptom this week was palpitations I get them sometimes but because I had a panic attack while I had one it made me fixate on it. The past week I have been seeking reassurance online EVEN THOUGH I have had 4 heart ekg and an echo done over the past 6 years. Most recently 5 months ago and I had palpitations EVERYDAY LEADING UP TO THE TEST and then when they said my heart was fine BOOM they disappeared for five months and now they are back. The past two days I’ve had maybe one but today I went out of my comfort zone and have only really had 3 of the skipping beat ones but they weren’t intense like the fluttering ones I’ve had. Now the palpitations are definitely caused by anxiety but I’m also wondering if my anxious phase cause acid reflux and it trigger palpitations that way aswell. Anyway I had 3 today and didn’t panic I went out on a walk I’ve been out and seen my girlfriend and her family and ate two good meals ! ( have on been eating toast and stuff because I was scared of the palpitations being triggered) but at this point I don’t care even tho they can be scary and uncomfortable they won’t harm me. I’ve cut out caffeine and sugars pretty much. My two decent sized meals were pasta and curried goat with rice haha. Today is a good day ! Stay blessed everyone ! ,1,0,0,0
"I quit vomiting because I was forced to… I was in a jail cell with another person and one toilet for a year and I couldn’t throw up. But now I feel like that was one of the best things for me even though in the beginning I gained a lot of weight, I’m slowly losing that weight. And today I ate a corn dog and some bread for breakfast and I thought, maybe I should puke. After that I thought, why should I? I am content. I am happy. I am in a better place. I take my anger out on positive coping skills, I don’t need to binge and throw up. I’ve been purge-free for almost two years now. I still have trouble with over exercising but I haven’t been this week so far so that is going good. I have moments where I feel like I should binge so that’s why I was so surprised about my train of thought today and I just wanted to share it so I could be more active in the community. Thank you.

"When my husband and I first got together I was medicated and mostly stable. He is very natural and pushed me to try life without meds, so I did. And for the most part- I’m doing okay but I struggle occasionally. Especially lately due to family issues and work. I am the agitated type when manic and everything annoys me. I’m also very sensitive so any criticism really pushes me. Anyways- I have a had a few drinks and when I drink all my stifled emotions bubble to the surface. And my husband is a very logical, type a person. He doesn’t get it and I don’t know that he really wants to. I have really suppressed a huge part of who I am in order to stay “normal” but I feel like I can’t do it much longer. How can I let my guard down with my husband and let him know who I really am deep down? I know he loves me but we are two totally different ppl who have lived very different lives. I feel like a big part of me is missing since I’ve been holding all of my darkness in… I’m ok with my darkness and I need to feel those things but it’s been so long that I forgot how to deal with it. I kind of have been considering getting back on meds, but I’m afraid to tell him. Please give me any advice you may have. Thank you. ",1,0,0,0

"I almost can’t believe my eyes reading all you’ve said here. I’m almost in tears, this is real. I’m terrified of doctors, and I’m scared to talk about the others with them. I didnt know this disorder existed, and I’m scared. I trusted 1 psychiatrist with information about what was making me feel sad, without even diving into my other “personalities”, and all they said after and as I was leaving was “ugh, don’t kill yourself.” Since that day years ago, I’m too afraid to discuss anything remotely close to DiD or depression, I’m worried they will put me away. I’m a sole family provider, age 24, have ADHD and am medicated 54mg concerta and have been on this mg for the last 10 years, different mgs another 10 years. I thought the meds could’ve caused psychosis, but now after many posts and interactions, I have been pointed here. After reading all that I have, there is not a doubt in my mind this is it. There are currently 5 of us that we can clearly count: Good Me, Bad Me, Girl Me, Child Me (age 4), and The Me Who Watches the other me’s. I’m everyone, everyday. The only place I can go to scream or try and cry is the shower, but still, I am alone with them, and they talk to me using my mouth, and I can see them from my mind to in front of me. Thy tell me things that scare me. Guilt me. Try to make me think bad things, things that push me to ending it all. But I perceiver as best I can, but I fear one of these days, I will lose the battle.

"I have complex ptsd alongside with dissociative disorder. I struggle with depersonalization and derealization. I went through a lot of childhood trauma from parental abuse and neglect, as well as being raised in a religious cult. I have only been able to put a name to all the things I struggle with in the past year, and boy has it been a tough year. Covid triggered a lot of deep rooted trauma and I’m the lowest I’ve been in years, going in and out of depression. I feel like I’ve regressed immensely and feel like I did back when I was a child. I also work as a behavioral therapist for kids with developmental disabilities, and a large part of that is working on extreme behaviors from an inability to emotionally regulate. So I deal with a lot of verbal and physical aggression. It’s been triggering so much stuff from the past. And I can’t even “self-protect” and leave the situation and need to “take it”. So I dissociate in the middle of work and then feel panicked, afraid, and ashamed because I don’t feel like I can even do my job. And am afraid people will notice and judge me for being incompetent. Also I space out and struggle to even form sentences. Sometimes people will say something to me and it’s hard for me to even process simple things. It’s hard to find a new job with COVID going on and this whole year has really made me doubt my abilities. Today has been really bad and I was at the point where I don’t see a point in going on. I wanted to do great things with my life but now that I started dissociating, I feel afraid that I won’t be able to do anything significant with my life. And simply trying to survive is not appealing to me. I really think it would be easiest to just end my suffering, but being raised in a religious background I was taught taking your life was punishable by hell. And that still has a hold on me. It’s like there no escape. I’m just so tired and discouraged. And terrified and just plain distressed. Especially knowing that it never really goes away. I would love to hear “success” stories about how it got better. It’s just so frustrating not being able to think or process and just feeling “gone”. I can’t be myself or enjoy talking to people or just living when I’m that checked out. And I feel so alone. ",1,1,0,1

"Last week I had a really scary situation where a memory popped up and wouldn’t go away, and I was in a lot of distress. At some point I felt myself get pushed back in my body. I was in the backseat and a small child was in the front with no ability to speak, just intense POWER over me. I was at work and luckily with a nonspeaking client doing arts and crafts at the time, so it worked out, and it made sense for me to be making stick figures out of pipe cleaners. But it’s very rare that I lose control like that and I honestly wish I hadn’t been conscious for it because the loss of control was actually freeing and I wanted someone else to take the wheel.

"I've been dealing with anxiety, depression and OCD for over 11 years. I also have ADHD and Aspergers. My mental issues have made my life extremely difficult and I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for 11 years as well. I've tried lots of medications, therapy and lifestyle changes like eating healthy and exercising more. They didn't give me enough relief for my issues. I started heavily using drugs and was drinking daily to cope. After 6 years of heavy drug use I ended up in rehab. I left rehab at the end of 2020. I was able to stay off drugs in 2021 and my life was heading in the right direction. 2021 was one of the best years of my life for this reason. I was eating healthier and jogging 4-5 times a week. At the start of 2022 I felt sick for no reason and developed a physical illness. I've had lots of tests done by doctors but they can't find out what's wrong with me. The symptoms I'm experiencing are the same symptoms as something like Dysautonomia. I developed Depersonalisation/derealisation 4 months after getting this illness. The last year or so has been absolutely awful. My other mental issues in combination with the physical illness and Depersonalisation/derealisation has made my life feel impossible. I'm on medication and seeing a psychiatrist and waiting to see a psychologist but I'm struggling to get through each day. I feel like I'm forcing myself to live. I don't have plans to commit suicide but I'm struggling with getting through each day. I am having suicidal thoughts. I don't understand how I'm supposed to cope with this.

"My life has been in a downward spiral for at least a decade. I turned 30 in November with the promise things would change. Things haven't changed. More of the same.

More then that I'm an emberassment. I'm the heroin addict of the family who can't hold a job or a relationship. I lash out and lose my cool easily. Saying things I don't mean but it's like I'm possessed when I get angry. I just can't control myself. I cut for the first time in a couple months yesterday. I really carved my arm up good with a razor. I have this intrusive thought. I keep picturing myself dead hanging in the closet. My past failed attempts all involved drugs or prescription pills. I have a bunch of Ativan, wellbutrin and depakote. Not sure what all that together would do. Probably nothing. I don't know what I want. I guess that's the conflict. I always heard your supposed to feel relieved when you make the final decision to end it. I just feel scared and conflicted. I don't want to live but I'm scared to die. Classic bpd predicament huh.

It’s only 3pm and I already went over my calories for the day…but I still need to have dinner later. I binged on abunch of random things. I would normally just exercise to burn it off but my legs are too sore from working out yesterday. Does anyone have tips for trying to elevate some of my guilt? I try to tell myself I’m “fueling my body” but I’m just so afraid of gaining weight ;~; ugh ,0,0,,0

"i’m mostly just complaining here but it is so hard, I can’t believe i’m not even able to go a day without binging and purging when I genuinely try so so hard not to. I eat more during the day, I manage to overcome strong urges sometimes but If i overcome the initial urge it’s back less than 20 minutes later. i’m trying to celebrate mini wins like resisting the urge until night instead of starting during the day etc but it feels so pathetic to me (i know it’s not). the occasional days where i can go a day without it feel like a breath of air and like a break I don’t know what to do, the only times i’ve been able to reduce the b/p a little is during holidays where i have no uni and or work. but as soon as I get a bit stressed it’s back to everyday and it’s not realistic for me to never be stressed. I’m in a treatment program (outpatient) and i have so many good coping mechanisms to pull from, and they do work sometimes but as i said, if i overcome the urge at first it’ll be back soon and i have to do that process all day. i’m starting to lose hope that i can actually recover and that’s depressing too. it’s crazy to think that i’m unable to control my own actions to the point where i can’t stop myself from eating a shitload of food and throwing up daily????

"ive been here hundreds of times and yet it still feels real. my life is over and i know it. there is no getting past this. theres nothing else for me. its difficult to figure out which sub to post this in when i have so many disorders and ive been ill for so much longer than bpd has been in my life but here i am. i broke up with my boyfriend because something he said/did triggered me in such a way that i could just not get over and my brain said that it had to be over. this was the strongest ive felt during those moments of breakup attempts. i was so sure of how i felt, i knew it was real and there was no going back, no fixing it. my mom came home to me crying and she made things excruciatingly worse to the point where i just shut down completely. i had to debate ending my life, going to hospital or just doing nothing at all. a few hours later and i decided i will do nothing because i know i cant do anything. im so far removed from my body and this reality that i couldnt do anything about it. why is my life over? because my entire life has been filled with everyone hating me. everything i say and do is wrong so why should i stay when im not wanted. ill make everyone happy and just fuck off. you know ive felt like this since i was 12 years old and im almost 26. how horrible is that? i was a CHILD having my brain tell me that the whole world wanted me dead. its only gotten worse since then. its been confirmed over and over again that my belief is fact. i am the worst human being on the planet. when i die everything in the world will be better. again, same beliefs ive had since i was 12. the thing is that im so afraid of death i have no clue if i will even be able to go through with anything. its been 14 years of this and it feels like theres no end in sight. but there has to be..

"Is there anyone else here who experiences fugue states, and departures from the self that result in like… moving away or disowning a profession etc. I’m so lost in my maze. I have managed to tangle myself so bad I can’t even move. I have diagnosed possessive DID. I need my doctor more often than I can see them. I find myself in horrifying text books and feel alone in my experience. Most people look at me funny even who have ptsd. Just wanna know I’m not alone. Why is everyone saying this doesn’t come from pain and suffering? I’m so confused. I wake up mid conversations in places that are unfamiliar and need to take medications and drugs to alter my mind so I don’t have to suffer constant mental assaults. I hurt myself and sabotage myself in creative ways (I’m safe at the moment) and when I try to plug one hole another one starts leaking because the very boards of the vessel were rocked out of place by the impacts of what happened to me. Why are people thinking you can’t absorb the identifying qualities of an animal or even an object. The literature literally talks about it. Why are people feeling invalid? We don’t control what we absorb into ourselves at the ages that science (round earthers) say we do. That can be anything. Desperate times desperate measures. Some children just have to be a fly on the wall to survive their mind breaking experiences. I’m not a fly. I shouldn’t need to say what I am outside of treatment and loved ones. I some times literally watch myself helplessly get hijacked by something I don’t recognize as me that possesses me long enough to make life changing decisions. I’m hurt, sad, angry, lonely, exhausted, confused, and terrified almost all the time. Because of shit other people did to me. Like decades ago. I dunno. I just want some one to tell me where to sit and lick my wounds. That everything will be okay. Some ones been here before. That they think of me. Forget fondly. Every one rushes to give me solutions that won’t work for me but I can’t tell them why in a week even. It’s just too long of a tale. I have been in therapy more than once a week often for the last decade. I’m seeing returns. I feel healthier. But I look around as I see myself and understand myself I feel more and more alone.

I tend to go back and forth between thinking I'm super ugly and I'm a terrible person to sometimes suddenly being obsessed with myself. Thinking I'm the best kind of person to be and everyone should be like me. And thinking I'm incredibly hot and everyone wants me. And often I feel all of these things at the same time and it's confusing. Walking down the street thinking all the people in the cars must think I'm hot shit but then if someone stares at me I think they think I'm ugly and weird. Simultaneously hating every inch of myself while also thinking that I'm better than most people because most people can't measure up to how kind and understanding and compassionate I am..idk. it's a weird mess.

"I want to know if any of you have gotten olfactory hallucinations before. Honestly, a lot of times I have gotten the smell of the perfume of a woman before. Sometimes it has smelled a lot like the perfume of a woman in her 30's or 40's. Sometimes it smells like rose bushes in my house. Sometimes it smells like the perfume someone I had a crush on in highschool wore. Sometimes it smells like a man's cologne. Sometimes it smells like that funky smell when a man wakes up in the morning.

"There are so many boxes to be checked, so many ends to be met in order for one to be considered ""alright"". So much maintenance work alone to be done on a daily basis. Reality overwhelmed me a while ago, I'm at my wit's end and I want out. But the only ways out of this are financial independence, Buddha's levels of transcendence and death. Only one is realistic. Life is way too much effort for little payoff, what's the argument for not skipping this struggle besides causing some people brief grief? That it might get better in 15 years? Shit, I might come back to betting, I might just hit it big. What is this productivity that everyone speaks of, anyways? What work is being done, exactly? What am I achieving by completing all them chores life throws at me? Who am I proving myself to? For what? Why would I live a life of going to sleep early, waking up early, pissing, shitting, eating, showering in hurry, working at least 8 hours a day for below average pay, spending majority of my waking time completing tasks I don't care about, spending time with people I dislike, pretending to respect the higher ups acting all grateful for the opportunity? Just to come back to my room, spend the remaining hours on other chores, perhaps watch few episodes of some TV show in an unfruitful attempt to relax before tomorrow's day's work? How can this fuckery be considered healthy, even praised by many but suicide cannot? Am I too selfish? Too ignorant? To blind to see all this fucking fortune I've been blessed with by the Lord? Anyways. I just wish I could find myself to be near effortlessly content, like deadwood's Titlicker. I begrudge that man his capacity for happiness. Every now and then hopelessness makes me it's bitch for a night, last night being the recent example. I was thinking of ways to escape this limbo, only to come up with depressing conclusions, per usual. I've been thinking about how all life advice sounds like buzzwords people mindlessly repeat after all those years. Different buzzwords for different communities. I've been thinking about the anxiety, whether it's reasonable or not. I think my anxiety and general misery are justified and the usual advice gives off ""head in the sand"" vibe. I figured people are afraid to admit that I'm a lost cause, unfit to function in modern society. No amount of meditation and ""clearheadedness"" could make me feel content with the lifestyle described above. There's no going back to being ignorant either. I've been thinking about how setting goals doesn't help, how it's just another deflection from reality. Last year's February I wanted to get a driver's license, not because I needed it, but to get myself out of the rut, show myself that I still can achieve things, that I'm not completely braindead. I brutally procrastinated for about 10 months on the subject but that's a whole another story. I got my license a week ago, felt happy and relieved for maybe few hours, but life goes on. It didn't resolve a fucking thing, there was no big epiphany, there was no existential glow up. I've been thinking about how disposable I am and that society sees me as such, I tried consoling myself with the thought that I'm not the center of the universe and my problems aren't as serious as they appear in my hour of weakness. But even that brought the opposite result than intended. It made me realize that this isn't just a bad dream I'll wake up from as soon as I open my eyes. No matter how many tears I pour into my pillow, how many screams said pillow muffles, how many punches the wall to my left takes - no one will appear in the hallway to hug me, tell me they understand and take those feelings away. It made me realize that my suffering is exactly what it is - it's just my suffering. This really brought my loneliness to the surface. I started feeling those subtle, yet disarming stabs in my chest that made me curl up into a ball knowing this will last for as long as I live. I don't think I've ever felt so weak and hopeless. All those feelings were later followed by apathy and I just started into the ceiling until around 7 am when I finally fell asleep. ",1,1,0,1

"This whole thing started with trying to loose a bit of weight… looking back I was actually really healthy and muscular and had a great body fat percentage. My strength and performance was the best it had ever been and I loved working out and seeing results but I became obsessed with it, and thought I needed to be “skinnier”. I became orthorexic and had an obsession with working out and eating as little as I possibly could. After about a year of restriction and loosing XXlbs I broke and started b/p. Now, been bulimic for almost 2 years and have lost another XXlbs and I’m the lowest I’ve ever been - not just physically but emotionally. My BMI has gone from normal, to underweight, to moderately at risk, to severe. I feel like my life sucks and it’s all my fault. I have zero energy. It’s heartbreaking and I’m so ashamed of myself and what I’ve done. I don’t want to do this anymore and I seriously wish it would just go away. I really don't want to be here anymore. I heard a stat years ago saying x% of people struggling with anorexia/bulimia would rather die than recover and I couldn't relate more. ",1,1,1,1
"Feeling incredibly lonely and really depressed for the past week I've been breaking up and getting back together and breaking up again with my voices boyfriend. I've been living in my head for the past 7 years. sometimes reality hits me in my face and I realize that it's incredibly unhealthy for me to have a relationship with one of my voices. I tend to think that I actually have a meaningful relationship that is actually connected to someone outside of my body. This person actually exists as a human but it couldn't possibly be a real relationship. I stopped following this person's social media because reality actually sits in a little bit realizing that in life I have actually no meaningful connections with this person. Depression and loneliness is hitting me hard. Luckily I have one good best friend that I've had for the past 5 or 6 years and we talk to each other all the time outside of my head. He wants to marry me and a part of me wants to marry him too but there's many red flags with him he has no car barely transportation he has a job though does drugs and drinks like a fish. Has poor credit and is $50,000 in debt. A part of me wants to marry him because I'm so hopeless of actually finding real love for someone who loves me as my size the way I am. The reason why I love him as my best friend is because he accepts me for who I am and compliments me everyday tells me how beautiful I am and how much he loves me. Should I marry this man and hope for the best? I just don't understand I go to bed at night with the thought of actually marrying him and planning our wedding then to waking up with disgust and only liking him as my best friend. My voices tend to take over and force me to fall back in love with my voices. I want to get married and settle down and have a family and live a normal life...

"Living with BPD really sucks when …you don’t really have any close relationships with anyone. (Almost?) all of my relationships with my friends in the past year have become very surface-level. It’s a defense mechanism after splitting on some friends at college and then getting diagnosed with BPD shortly after.  I had a really difficult week of just straight isolation and have heard from one friend who’s reached out to me, and I really appreciate her for that. But otherwise from people I regularly see throughout the week, I haven’t heard from anybody. Isolation really fucks me up, so I’m trying to take into account that I’ve been confined to my room almost all week and that maybe I am not as distant with people as I think... But why don’t I ever hear from anyone? Why am I not affectionate with a single person in my life??? i fucking hate when I get like this. Whenever I’m doing well, it almost never lasts.

After a decade of therapy and 6 years of medications it’s gotten so bad. I can’t do anything anymore. I can hardly leave the house. I don’t have any friends to call.
