"our most broken and least understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it. we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster. it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""pm me anytime"" in a casual social context. we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves. we're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start. our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone. it will be maintained at r depression wiki private contact, and the full text of the current version is below. summary anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact i.e. pms, chat, or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement. either way, it's unwise to trust them. ""pm me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. and it might be perfectly well meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea. here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately. by posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the op. if your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers. the 1 9 9 rule https: en.wikipedia.org wiki 1 25 rule internet culture applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet. people who are struggling with serious mental health issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high level of ever changing emotional need. unless the helper is able to make a 1 commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. this is why mental health crisis line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders. it's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole. analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole. even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high intensity situations alone. it's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental health issues including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression escalate, in a pm conversation it's much harder for others, including the r depression and r suicidewatch moderators to help . contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police pms. in our observation over many years, the people who say ""pm me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental health issues and mental health support. we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively. community input mitigates these limitations. there's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny . if helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma. we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others. these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental health issues. if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning. if ops want to talk privately, posting on a wide open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. although we don't recommend it, we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support. if you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them.",0
"regular check in post, with information about our rules and wikis. welcome to r depression's check in post a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here , or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share. our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar you can also always access them at r depression about rules since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here we always want to know and deal as soon as we can. we also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support: r depression wiki what is depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off topic issues. r depression wiki giving help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is and isn't usually helpful in giving peer support. ysk that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are: people breaking the private contact rule. you should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. see r depression wiki private contact ""i'm here to help"" posts. this shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. the ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this. role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. this is an expert free zone that's what peer support means rule 5 . we know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. nothing like that is ever acceptable here. content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support or, in a comment, giving it rules 1, 2 and 1 . off topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. the ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 1 valid and serious but inappropriate here.",0
"when it happens after 3 yo, nobody gives a shit when you're life is falling apart. everyday i feel lower, everyday the things i thought were secure slip further away. i've never spoken to anybody about depression, but now that i've tried to reach out to friends, i realize i may need professional help. job stress is compiling to the point i want to quit but can't because its a better paying job than anything near me, and i need the money. 1 year relationship is coming to a ugly end, found out she cheated, and i suspect its ongoing. were going to couples therapy, but it really feels like each day my so grows colder and colder. ive never felt so alone in my own home. i've tried to reach out to friends, not emotionally dump on them, but let them know how i've been feeling. and it really just turns into ""oh man... thats crazy, insert what they're going through "". the first time that happened i just focused on them, let them vent. i thought i would feel better being there for a friend. but when it happened with a close friend a week later, i was honest. ""hey, i really could use an ear right now."" and he just sighed and said, ""bitches lie and cheat. leave her and save your money"" i get it, its hard all over. but like i said, nobody gives a shit when your life is falling apart.",0
"its so fucking crazy to me that people actually want to be alive. im looking at my parents rn, they work their ass off all day for all week, working a shitty job that doesnt pay good to get home, eat shit food, sleep and repeat it. and theyve never had the thought that life might not be worth the effort, or that its all pointless. but i guess theyre 'normal', if u add mental illness into the mix and try to make a normal person work all day all week for shitty pay from a shitty job, who wouldnt kill themself? its fucking insane to me that more people in this position arent considering it, like how the fuck is it worth it? its so much work to go to a job all day and interact and use energy to help people and do repetetive tasks all day every day just to barely earn enough money to survive, it simply isnt worth it for me, id really rather be dead. i mean is it that bad a decision? staying alive has literally no positive points for me, its just work, and sleep and in the little free time i have, i get high which is only temporary. no friends, avpd so i cant make any friends and obviously not a fucking girlfriend, nothing is fun, how do normal people do it? are they just so stupid they never consider how much their life sucks? maybe they just dont mind working? maybe their life is actually worth the effort, they dont mind their job as they have lots of reasons to keep going, things to work towards etc. i dont know but how the fuck arent more people freaking out about this, i worked for like 2 days and i already felt suffocated, overwhelmed, on the verge of a panic attack just from being there, its too mcuh knowing i have to do this for bascially the rest of my life, that im on break and still have 8 hours of straight work to go. i really think id rather be dead than just keep putting myself through taht and im fucking baffled at how no one else seems to mind this, i know im not exactly normal and cant relate to the average person but even so, i dont know how they can work even part time, never mind full time and still want to be alive. i think normal people, non mentally ill people are basically a different species at this point. might as well be with how different we are, like trying to compare a lion to a cat. maybe the same thign but very different types",0

"turned my life around, depression didn't go away. what's the fucking point then?. after 1 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, i eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot. at 29 i finally graduated from the degree i'd started at 18, i somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. i'd started exercising more and going to the gym. i'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now i was dating a girl who obviously loved me. throughout my 2 s i thought if i pushed hard enough and persevered, i could eventually be happy. but good old me, i'm still miserable. the success i've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. i still feel like an empty shell. my brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. i have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences. i broke up with the girl i was dating, because even though i cared about her, and on some level i knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, i seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. it was eating me up inside knowing that i couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. i feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. i'm so tired. i'm tired of therapy and trying to get help. tired of having to push myself to keep existing, when all i get in return is feeling sad and lonely. i'm tired of suddenly finding myself a few years older and realising i have no new happy memories. it's all a waste of time.",0

"behavior health inpatient. i'm not ok.. my s o expressed suicidal thoughts and more to me and we called his doctor who told us to go to the er to be evaluated. this is after extensive questioning about the options he has. he has been impatient twice in his life years ago and it was a horrible experience for him i.e they didn't care and treated him horribly. i asked many different docs nurses over the phone what to expect so he felt he had some control and wouldn't feel like a 'prisoner'. no one could give us definitive answers. finally he spoke to his doctor and i guess she convinced him to go and basically yelled at me to drive him there immediately even though i made it clear he has no intent to harm himself right now. but since he was ok going, we went. he expressed how he didn't want to be dropped off by me which i assured him i wasn't. and that's exactly what's happening right now. he checked in, they checked him for weapons, then took him from me without telling us anything. telling me to go wait in waiting room. when i asked when i can go back there they said to basically go home or if i want i can wait for him to call me but i can't see him. they made me take his phone from him. so ok hospital phone. but this all happened so quickly we didn't even have a chance to say goodbye because we didn't know what was happening. i know this sounds like the norm in a way, but for him this is exactly what he didn't want to happen. we were told we could talk to the docs together to form a plan. this could actually make him much worse. i feel like shit 'doing this to him' i hope he doesn't think i 'planned this'. is there anything i can do? all we said to the front desk was very basic not concerning things. i have no one to vent to or ask because he doesn't want anyone knowing. which i understand. but right now i'm very upset by how this went down. has anyone ever been in this situation? either side? can he say he doesn't want to stay here and they'll let him go?",0

"depression has turned me into a bad person. maybe i was a bad person to begin with and was too naive to see my actions, i don t even know anymore. from what i remember, before i became depressed, everyone would tell me how sweet i was and i would find joy in such the smallest things. now i hate everyone and everything. i used to love spending time with my family, but now whenever they re around, i completely isolate myself. i self sabotage every relationship i get in, it s so impossible for me to feel love for someone in that way, all i find is their faults. it all makes sense though, how the hell am i supposed to love someone else when i literally hate myself? i hate going out because i can t help but compare myself to others. everyone is prettier then me, their body looks better, their clothes look better, etc. i can t even pray anymore, my faith is so down the drain and on top of that, school starts in 1 days and i don t know if i can mentally handle it. i m on academic probation because my gpa doesn t meet requirements and now that s added stress. i m so jealous of people who are genuinely happy, people who are in relationships, girls who aren t fucking skinny like me. i don t know. i just hate myself but i m too embarrassed to admit i have a problem",0

"i don t get it. there is not a redeemable quality about life that makes it worth living to me. to be clear, i will never complete suicide. i would literally love nothing more than to do it, but the unending guilt of contemplating that makes me feel ill. i could never put the people that love me through that. but that just means i cannot escape until the day i die of my rotting, withering body. i m so sick of trying to convince myself that the future will be better when it has only ever gotten worse. nothing i do helps. i have everything that i need in life yet my brain refuses to let me feel joy or love or one second of peace and quiet. i have no passion, motivation, or enjoyment in my life. i don t know what to do. i feel so helpless and scared",0

"all i ve done is lose. it s like my life has never gone up. i grew up in a moderately wealthy family, i had excellent grades across the board, smart, was good at sports and music, popular, had quite a few hobbies, and in my school they thought i was a looker too now i m 22, i m a college dropout, unemployed, living in a cheap hostel with barely any money and estranged from my family. i ve given up or lost interest on most of my hobbies and won t call the few people i m in contact with my friends. stopped going to the gym, don t know why i cut off my long hair, haven t been on a date in over a year. i mean i know i can fix some of these but it s not like when i was more fit and went to parties every week and had a part time i was a much happier person. i guess some of those things that i had were just illusions, but at least the illusions kept me happy. like if i didn t know what my parents were doing was abuse and i didn t run away from them maybe i d still be in school, still have money, still have relatives who act proud of me and a younger brother who looks up to me. in high school i was one of the popular kids. i hung out with the preps, studied with the nerds, played sports with the jocks and spent the evenings playing games with the geeks. but i guess at some point i just played a shit ton of video games to escape my parents and fucked up my sleep schedule so hard, and then i still tried to maintain my dropping grades so i cut out most of my after school socializing and didn t go to people s birthday parties and shit anymore and now i don t even know if the kids i used to hang out with remember that i exist. i mean, they ve all moved on to something better. a few of them have their own businesses with their parents money, some of them are doctors and programmers and bankers, a few of them rich enough to just party away and not care about college. i don t even know if they d want to associate with me anymore. recently my ex from 8th grade asked a friend of mine how i was doing i m not on any social media and i was gonna reach out and say hi but then i looked at myself in the mirror like a malnourished, ugly, broke dropout. meanwhile the new friends that i ve made are fleeting, but i don t know if i can complain because they re just as self destructive as i am and in a way i m just lucky that it s not caught up to me yet. i latch on to the few old friends that i still have but really we have nothing in common anymore. all these people with so many close friends that they treat as their second family and boyfriends and girlfriends that aren t psychotic or abusive and i m stuck in a recycle bin with all the other rejects and delinquents, but even there they think i m too much of this way or another. i don t even know what i want out of my life. i m just here wasting time until i run out of money and die i guess. i don t know what winning is to me or what success feels like because every time i try to build towards something i become disinterested in what s ahead in whichever path i take. to say that i peaked in high school would mean that my high school life was better than my middle school life, more accurately i peaked the day i came out of the womb and it s been a decline ever since. it s not being behind that irks me, it s the fact that once i m behind, i m left alone in the dust. i ve never really wanted much out of life some friends i trust, someone to love, a job i don t hate, enough money to put food on the table and not be so fucking depressed all the time, but so far none of that has happened yet no matter what i do. you guys know the pokemon slaking? it s got the stat total of a legendary and a pretty good move pool, but it s handicapped by an ability that makes him dick around once every other turn and as a result he s one of the worst pokemon in the game. that s basically how i feel.",0
"if i kill myself i want to see certain people's reactions tw: suicide. i care more about other people than i do about myself. i've dedicated my life to being the person to other people that i never had. i over compensate when i do something wrong, i spend so much time focusing on other people that i don't take care of myself and i ignore my own triggers so people can rant to me. sometimes i wish i didn't make myself that person so nobody would care if i killed myself. i also want people to realize that what they did to me killed me and if they didn't do what they did i would still be here. if i did kms i would want to see the people that hurt me's reactions. i want to see their faces when they realize that if they just shut up and weren't assholes someone wouldn't have died. i want to see their faces when they realize they killed me and i want them to soak in it. if i killed myself my suicide not would have a list of names, bullies names, and it would say at the bottom, ""this is your fault, you killed me."" i would also want them to know about the note. the only downside is that i don't want to hurt the people i love and care for. what do you guys think",0
"it s getting harder and harder. i had been depressed for a while but now it s getting so much worse and i don t know what to do. i spend my days not wanting to do anything, with a constant feeling of apathy and sadness from when i wake up until i go back to sleep, but this last week i'm starting to have more recurring suicidal thoughts and i really don't know what to do, i'm desperate. i have friends i could talk to but i don't want to look dramatic or scare worry them, i know they love me but i haven't felt that for a long time, i don't feel loved by anyone at all. i also don't think talking to them would solve anything or make me feel any better. since i was very young i have lived with a very unstructured family that has done nothing but fill me with traumas and deprivations that i now have to deal with every day and i can't take it anymore. i'm at my limit i'm so tired of feeling like no one cares about me or that i'm never anyone's priority, always the second choice. this feeling of loneliness is killing me i can t even describe it. there is never anyone to congratulate me on my achievements or anyone to care for me when i can't take it anymore so what s the point. i've been sleeping very little for several days with anxiety attacks that don't even let me rest, the only moment where everything is supposed to stop . i just wanted to get that off my chest sorry if there s any typo english is not my first language.",0
"things stacking up and i don't know how to handle it. this year actually started quite good for me. i found a girl that brightened up my life after years of being alone. she is mental unstable because of events in the past, but in therapy and on medication for that. the first month went perfect, we even went on vacation. it was the first time i traveled by plane in another country. after the vacation, everything went downhill. first my car broke down, which i need for my job. after a few days of repair and an expensive bill be aware, i just brought the trip, so i was already short on money , i got my car back and on the very day i got my car back, my girlfriend started getting more and more distant and had a mentally breakdown. after that, it first seemed everything would go better, but at one point we had a talk and she suggested a break because of her mental state and that she can't give me the attention i deserve. i was optimistic that after short time we might get back together and she told me, she was hoping to get there too, because her feelings were still there for me. two weeks after our conversation, i got covid infected and was unable to do anything for over a week. in that time, she was the loveliest and most caring person to me. now two weeks after i recovered, she got silent again till today where i asked her about everything and all signs are leading to a full breakup. i just don't know to handle everything anymore. i can't eat and if i eat anything, it just comes right back. sleep is rare and if i sleep, i have nightmares. at the moment i try talking to friend, try to play some of my favourite video games but everything feels like hard work and i just want to lie down and cry all the time. any suggestions what i can try? sorry for bad english, not my mother tongue.",0
"just my uninteresting life. hi my name is andr i'm 16, i'm making this post because i wanted to know if someone could help me out of this boring and repetitive situation of mine. i've been more introverted than usual for a while and i don't know exactly why, i don't feel comfortable around people, i don't really know how to describe it. i have extremely low self esteem so that's why i don't feel like leaving the house either because i worry a lot about what other people will think about, for example, the clothes i'm wearing, my aesthetics... i'm doing this post on redit because here i can stay anonymous or at least most won't know who i am. . i think the problem has been getting worse as i went on vacation because the time i have on vacation is around 3 months, so i just sit at my pc all day, literally i don't do anything anymore. i decided to make the post today because today i needed to leave the house and on the way i saw several people and the only thing i could think of from each of them was: ""how shitty my life is right now... people having fun or at least distracting themselves from all the problems they probably have while i sit in a chair every day playing the same boring games"" i passed by a beach, and as i mentioned a few sentences ago i have almost self esteem i don't go to the beach or anything like that . i don't know if i was able to express myself very well in my post because i don't know how to express myself about what i naturally feel but at least i tried. if anyone has tips please leave them in the comments so i can test and see if my life improves a little. in case anyone wonders why i was talking about this here instead of talking to a psychologist or psychiatrist, i don't know the exact difference between them, it's because i didn't trust these people to tell them about my personal life, any more than i trust people in general. for me it's easier to talk on the internet where no one knows me and they don't know what my face looks like than telling someone eye to eye that i'm 1 sure i wouldn't have it so easy to tell the things like i have to do here thanks for your attention.",0

"im 15 and these two beliefs of mine are ruining my mental state and making me feel constantly hopeless. im 15 but i've been diagnosed with depression since i was really young. i suffer from stuff outside of depression i might have schizophrenia if that changes anything and lately these two thoughts i keep having have been worsening my depression day by day and making me lose all hope for the future. one of the beliefs i've been struggling with is feeling like all humans are inherently bad people by default. i can't trust anyone i talk to and i feel like no matter what happens the only person i can trust is myself. i have a general hatred towards humans and i've shut myself off from the majority of my friends because i assume sooner or later i'm going to realize they're horrible people. the second belief that's been affecting me and making my mental state worse is believing that no matter how hard i try it is impossible for humans to get into a healthy relationship. i've currently been dating this girl for a year and a half and things went okay until recently where i've been extremely paranoid that something she'll do something bad to me and im basically mad at her a lot without any actual reason and just because im paranoid that she's going to do something bad to me. i have relationship trauma, and im extremely focused on the future and part of the reason im dating her is because we have plans to spend our future together and i used to find a lot of comfort in it but now im just scared because i can't even trust her. it's gotten to the point where i genuinely don't believe romantic love is real and believing so is just setting yourself up for being taking advantage of or manipulated. i'm severely depressed and angry all the time because of my fear towards humans and relationships and now i don't know what to do or where to go. does anyone know of any advice or what could be causing this?",0

"when depression causes you to lose empathy sympathy for others. i hope maybe i can find others here that have felt this, because i feel like such a terrible person these days. i can t handle bad news or sad things anymore. and i feel like this stems from how sad and bad news has seemed to filter into every aspect of my family. everyone in my family has gone through it their entire lives. we didn t play games and laugh at family gatherings. we sat in a circle in the living room and talked about what tragedy had happened recently. i, personally, haven t had much happen to me compared to the rest of my family. but i have intense anxiety and depression. my dad recently died of cancer, and my mom has been battling medical problems for as long as i can remember. and it s all she talks about. she, and the rest of my family do this thing i call tragedy bombing . you walk into a room where they are or start a totally innocuous conversation and then before you know it, you re getting a rundown of every tragic thing that has ever happened to them. like you got a bomb dropped on you out of nowhere. for years i have listened to this, but my depression and anxiety have gotten worse and worse, and i m at the point where i avoid walking into a room with my mom because i just can t do it anymore. i can t hear it anymore. i get anxious. my heartbeat picks up. i get simultaneously short of breath and sad and angry. and i usually get pulled into these tragic conversations for upwards of 3 4 minutes at a time. there is no hey, can i talk to you? either. like i said, it s very just here, have all this tragic information. boom. afterwards i feel so drained i can t do anything for the rest of the day. i ve tried to tell my mom i can t shoulder that burden anymore, but she either gets mad or just keeps going. i feel like i can t even walk to go get a glass of water without her seeking me out to talk to me about something super depressing and heavy. i started realizing that i have lost my empathy sympathy because of it. i can t watch serious shows. i can t listen to sad stuff. when my friends have something bad happen in their life, i think, no, anything but this , the great irony because i need a lot of support from them, but can no longer offer it. i am tired and just want to sleep. i don t want to deal with people , but something in the back of my mind says, i don t want to deal with people who have baggage . i feel like i just reached my limit of sadness that i can take, and i feel horrible for it, which is further fueling my depression and making me feel like a terrible person. i feel so terrible for being someone who has mental illness, but can no longer relate to or offer support to others who have gone through something or who also have mental illness. does anyone else deal with these feelings or i guess, lackthereof?",0
"things were going pretty ok. the year started off pretty well with meeting a new person and actually thinking i could be in a relationship again. about a month later, that went up in flames bc she wasn't over her ex who was still stringing her along for the last year. met someone else who ghosted me after two months, and less than 2 weeks ago i lost my home and 2 best friends in one fell swoop because of job transfers. so now i'm pretty much alone in a city i have lived in my whole life and never felt more alone.",0

"depression has changed my definition of an ok good life. this may sound a bit rambly but i just want to know if other people have the same experience as me. i m not sure how to articulate this but i feel like whenever i m at a baseline mentally and i m not actively hating my existence i feel like my life is good and not a mess when i m reality i have so many things to work on. like i m trying to stop smoking everyday and keep failing with that, stopped vaping for 3 months then picked it back one day but haven t done it in a couple of days trying to quit for the last time. i lowkey have body image issues that i try my hardest to ignore and have a terrible relationship with food. i m graduating college in the spring and have no plans bc i have no idea what i want to do there s just so many more things that i don t wanna get into but let s just say my life is a fucking mess. but since i m not depressed i feel like i m living my best life. maybe it s weed making me extremely unconcerned with the state of my life but i honestly don t even know where to start to try to fix anything. yeah i feel like im just ranting but anybody feel anything similar to this?",0

"just a long rant of different things. if you read all the way through, i really appreciate it. what s it even like to not have depression? how can people just go and live their lives and not feel they way i do, especially my peers? this is the only reliable place i can go to vent, unfortunately. and then i kinda just feel alone. i looked up for the statistics for the things i suffer with and then i realize i m in the minority because the majority of people don t feel like this. like sure there s treatment, but there s not a cure for this stuff. i m never not gonna feel nothing all the time. i don t even remember what it was like to feel something other than nothing. and when i do feel happy, i just feel disgusted at the emotion because i know it makes me positive and idealistic. there s just too much stuff i ve been through that i don t even know how to process, or what it even means. i don t even know if i have trauma or not. i don t know what s normal or what it s like to be normal. there s too many uncertainties in my life. too many things i ve been through that i feel like the average person wouldn t understand while growing up, i have been shamed for showing signs of my mental illnesses and mental health issues from people who should have helped me, such as my parents, siblings, and teachers. how was i supposed to know what was wrong with me or that i even had a problem in the first place? and now i feel i am too far gone anyways and that it is too late to get help. it s not like therapy s an option right now anyways i see everyone around me looking like adults and they wear makeup, drive cars, have a part time job. and the girls actually have boobs and curves, unlike me. in addition, i feel different than my peers because of 1. my race 2. my origins 3. my body shape and height.",0

"life finally seemed good after a turn for the worst but it kinda feels worse now. when i was 12 my mom suddenly passed away and i lived with her my whole life and only saw my dad every other weekend and a trip in the summer. so my dad had custody since he was the father, which was ok at first but was definitely not what it seemed. later living with him it made me realize how much of a terrible person he is, how manipulative he is, and how controlling he is. long story short he has manipulated me into pushing the people that can help me away, doesn t let me spend any of my money that i saved up for and i literally just want to buy a new computer that s all, he says he is low on money all the time but he has a 6 figure job, and is a pathological liar. he treats me like trash, always trying to bring me down and make everything seem like he is perfect. he will constantly say depression doesn t make you stupid so just work harder, and everyone has depression to a certain extent yes depression doesn t make you stupid but it gives you little motivation to work with, and everyone doesn t have depression is like a constant sadness. he always tries make me feel better with a cookie from the gas station down the road, which is like a big fuck you imo like he is basically just here s a cookie now quit it. he has made me very alert of every sound footstep i hear i m always listening because of him. i have been hospitalized 4 times because of him. the first time we had a meeting and was like ok let s work on it it made me really happy but then when i was discarded on the ride home he said everything i said was bullshit. in between the first and second hospitalization during the summer while we vacationed to grandma s and he had to leave early because of work reasons so i stayed a month before going back home and while he was home he bought a puppy from a breeder and literally picked the worst dog for our living situation, don t get me wrong i love the dog to death and would give the world to him but he is a english springer spaniel which has tons of energy, and is now 1 years old and can barely sit down most of the time when told so, i feel so bad for the dog because he will probably never get proper training and will probably live a terrible life with my dad. but during the second hospitalization nothing too special happened except with this one quiet time rule where after every activity we had to stay in our rooms quiet for like 15 3 minutes i forget and if we were loud we would get called last if it was lunch or dinner time. so i protested against the rule so they decided to take me off my antidepressant and put me on a mood stabilizer for bipolar and other disorders, which is honestly is a big fuck you because i m too angry or whatever, literally just stood in the hallway complaining about it to the staff in the hallway, nothing more nothing less. third hospitalization different hospital was honestly one of the better ones for one reason, this one staff named stan, honestly is one of the smartest people i know who i wish i had a hotline for, he has gained my respect and i gained his. he would literally do his job for free if he didn t have bills to pay and a family to care for. he should honestly write a book, hope we can play one more game of rummy 5 : he made me feel like a human being because he never put himself higher than anyone else and would always treat us with respect, you should never let anyone tell you because i m a adult and your a child, which is not a reason and if anyone says that to you it shows that they are very week minded. 7 fourth hospitalization same as third was the point i stopped letting these hospitals butter me up to send me back home to dad and be all happy for a few weeks and then send me back a few months later, had a good time with stan again. now here i am now in a residential and am nearing my first month, i have met my beautiful girlfriend here which was amazing because we just clicked, but she got hospitalized for almost 2 weeks now and yesterday i just had this pain wrenching feeling in my chest i m going to die not by killing myself or anything but just a feeling i m going to die idk why but i did. i felt fine today but i don t know it just felt like a panic attack i don t know what those feel like because if it is it is my first one, and i honestly don t know because i just been in a slightly ok mood since i m still able to have fun time but it s just like a weight on my back, i just don t know what to do because i just constantly have this looming fear of dying like i could die any second when i have nothing to distract me. i just don t know what to do i just feel like something and nothing at the same time idk i honestly just needed to get this out because i don t have a therapist and i don t have my girlfriend to talk to, any advice much appreciated thank you",0

"i feel like i've tried everything.... so where do i go from here?. i've been depressed as long as i can remember. i was 6 years old first time i said i didn't want to live anymore. i grew up in a lower middle class home. i had a loving amp; supportive family who immediately got me into therapy after i said that. i've been in therapy ever since. i was diagnosed with major depression at 1 . it got better for a while 12 16. i didn't feel consistently happy per se. but i had longer periods of time like i could breathe and then one day they stopped. i'm 25 now. these past 3 years have been particularly difficult. i cant enjoy anything. it' so hard to get out of bed or even my apartment. i have periods where i'll spend 2 or 3 weeks without stepping foot outside. i get my groceries amp; medication delivered, my therapies amp; physiatrist appointments are virtual. i'm not agoraphobic. i'm just so tired. i cant maintain friendships not because of drama or anything. i'm just so fucking exhausted mentally, emotionally,and physically. i cant keep up even in the slightest. the only person i have in my life is my mom. which sounds pathetic. but it's true. she stops by once a week. she calls me every couple days to make sure i haven't killed myself. amp; x2 b; but here's the thing: i'm not sitting around moping. i want to get better. i want to get better more than anything. in my lifetime i've been through 12 different therapists, 4 php programs, 7 iop, and 5 impatient programs. i've tried just about every combination of anti depressants. i've even done tms and ect therapy but nothing works. i'm still trying.... because i really want it to work. right now i attend 2 support groups, one is for people with dysthymia that meets weekly over zoom. the other is a major depression group that meets every other week. i do aa meetings i've been sober 5 years weekly. i go to therapy 2x a week and i see my psychiatrist monthly. i also maintain a healthy diet and exercise. to the best of my ability. the crippling lethargy that comes with depression makes it near impossible to do regularly that's been my treatment team plan for about two years. i know it's not working. i feel like i've tried everything. but maybe i havent? are there other treatments or therapies that have worked for you that i haven't mentioned? please let me know. i'm desperate. i want to die so bad. i dont want to be in this kind of pain anymore. but i cant do that to my mother. my brother od a couple years back and the grief i felt and still feel to this day is astronomical. i bet its even worse for her. i cant kill myself knowing i'd be giving her my pain. but i dont want to suffer like this.",0
"cant feel emotions in my body anymore. is it normal to lose the ability to feel emotions in your body? posted something similar days ago, but have found a picture to show what i am experiencing, or more accurately not experiencing. before i used to have really strong and intense physical responses to my emotions, and i would feel them deeply. now i dont feel anythfing in my body. not even the warmth of contentment and relaxation. only stuck in neutral. also dont feel tired when working out this one is so strange , and never sink back into my chair. i never get that nice heavy feeling in my body. still just neutral. this has happened over the last few weeks i can cry, but i dont feel any emotion in my body when i do. my chest does not tighten and i cant feel the sadness like that. my chest just feels empty and hollow. i try to feel, but it still just empty in my body. i also dont feel touch like before, i am not numb, but i dont get tingles or good feelings in my body with touch or hugs. i dont get warm feelings in my chest and stomach. still just empty. i feel like there is no connection at all between my brain and body, so the body does not generate an emotional response. sometimes i can feel sad in my brain mind if that makes sense, but then i cant feel any emotions in my body at all. it is so strange. sometimes all that happens is i get this muscle contracrion in my chest and back, but no pressure or other sensations. i cant react in an angry manner with voice changes and body language, but on the insade i still cannot feel that surge of rage. anyone else dont feel any emotions in their body? can this get better? https: media.npr.org assets img 2 13 12 3 13 21664 large b12e81ec59ec77bd24c6abc7cf6a221346ed3bdd s11 c5 .jpg",0

i don't understand how people can function at work and do their jobs. i've been working from home for a couple of years and tbh it's pretty lonely. and when i'm sad and depressed or triggered which is often i can't do my best work. i'm rarely feeling well enough to be productive so i just do the bare minimum to keep my job most of the time. how do people with depression actually work? on top of that i'm borderline and neurodiverse : the idea of not being sad all the time is such a foreign concept to me and i've forgotten what it's like. i don't understand how people can function normally.,0
"my therapist left me feeling worthless, i need support. this is long but please read i am so mentally destroyed because of my therapist. today's session left me feeling worthless amp; than i was a failure and i didn't expect it from my therapist who i had so much trust in. i was talking to my therapist about being lonely. it's something i've struggled with amp; have brought up the her before this time though had a specific trigger . after that i told her some classes i'm planning on taking to help myself get out more which she had told me to do and i was looking forward to taking these classes. pottery, martial arts, painting, etc it went downhill when i said the classes have to wait a few weeks due to an injury to my arm that won't allow me to participate. they have flexible start times, so the wait is only a few weeks. all of a sudden she started blaming me for feeling lonely because i was putting off these classes. i stressed to her again that it was beyond my control due to my injury but that wasn't enough. she then went on to blame me about changing my mind on college. awhile back i mentioned thinking about it but due to many personal reasons that she has previously heard amp; claimed to understand that college isn't possible this year due also partly to things beyond my control. i explained to her that i want to take things slow. i've had several personal tragedies this year that she knows about and even if i wanted college right now i'm in no mental shape to deal with that on top of my full time job. i'm also thinking i'd perfer vocational school instead of college. i want to take these next few months and put my life back together. i want to take life a day at a time, i want to get back to things i enjoy. i want to clean my house because it's become a mess in my depression. i want to get out and meet new people, i want to take casual classes with things that interest me without all the deadlines amp; stress. i want to go hiking on my days off again. i want to start training again for a 5k when my arm heals . after months of stress, of worry, and running around having to deal with every new life altering problem. i don't want to jump into a classes that i don't even want to take. i want to find myself again. she didn't understand that, she said i'm wrong amp; that i need to go to college no matter how hard it is amp; how expensive it is and that's the only way i'll succeed in life i left my session today is tears. it's been 7 hours since my session and i can't stop crying. i feel so hurt by the person i trusted wouldn't hurt me. i feel betrayed, i feel lost, i no longer have the support because she was my support. i don't know how to move past this.

"panic attacks because of opening up to a coworker. hello i m started a new job recently couple of months and pretty early on i got along great with a coworker f . we would spend a lot of time at work together since we were a great team even though our job roles don't usually permit teamwork. i have had depression for 13 years and have worked on it for the last 8 years with therapy meds. i was very stable before i joined this job. i have never experienced anxiety symptoms in my life. i never get afraid of anything, to be honest. when you are on death's door and death doesn't scare you nothing can really scare you anymore. at least that was my thinking prior to this. she and i talked deeply about issues we have, where i told her i have depression and am medicated. usually, i would never share this with a coworker but she made me very comfortable somehow. eventually, my feelings for this coworker developed over weeks, and i felt some kind of anxiety developing in me. i was afraid of disappointing her professionally and or privately. i would go out of my way to work immensely to help her out. i would work in my free time to help her out. every time i got to work i would have this feeling of immense stomach pain, like butterflies but x1 . my hands are shaking, i am short of breath and honestly, i can't really describe it. i have never experienced something like this before. i would have these panic attacks every time i would face her. if she was in a bad mood i would take it personally and would feel sick to my core. eventually, i had a depressive episode breakdown in front of her, i was honestly close to jumping out the window that day. i wasn't that close for years. since then i have been just a mess emotionally. i feel so ashamed and broken. she is very supportive and actually kind of a great person considering the circumstances. nonetheless, i am afraid of my anxiety around her or why i feel this way. i don't want to feel this attached needy of anybody. before i joined this job i was very independent. i am single and very happy about it in fact. if anyone can give me tips on how to deal with this anxiety please tell me. i will try to talk to my therapist and change meds asap. i changed meds recently and never felt this low with prior ones. should i distance myself from her? should i just straight up quit? should i take a long vacation? change meds?",0

"weighing heavily on me. i hate that i have resorted to posting on reddit, but i have noone around who understands me. my life seems so shitty, but i don't know how to fix it. people on the outside looking in might think that i have it made, but they do not see the struggle behind the ""success."" i in my opinion have to fight harder than anyone around me to achieve anything. case in point, i recently quit teaching after 5 years fucking hated all 5 years in hopes of getting into tech. after countless applications in the last three months, i have only received about 5 interviews, two of which i made it to the final interviews. they strung me along for an entire month, and still did not hire me. i have a master's degree and so many tansferable skills, but clearly i am not good enough. i cry so much because i am tired of struggling mentally. although i have a supportive mate and a small savings i do not want to depend on her. there is nothing like having my own. unfortunately, i also have communication and conflict issues with my mate unrelated to finances and i just recently had to cut off my toxic mother, again. i also relocated to a different state two years ago and still have no friends. i will not go into all the details of my life for sake of length, but i needed to get this off my chest. i just want to be happy, you guys. that's it. i am tired of everything being a challenge for me. i need a miracle.",0

"being queer in a hell hole. so i live in the caribbean as a queer 24 yr old male and it has not been fun. for a while, things are fine, meh, neutral and there is not much pressure so things are slow. i try to take advantage of these moments. but sometimes, i get into a spiral and at this point they are valid and they come from a real place. for a while now i have been feeling so much envy and frustration of being born in an environment where i can not express myself safetly or freely. not at homes, not with friends or school. my whole world is in my head and my living life is just this waiting game. i have never been in a relationship, i have never experienced intimacy and i really want to but i can not. i can blame this country all i want, i can self hate, envy ... that wont change anything right? so i try to work on myself so that i can be useful eventually, but i feel i have been doing this since my teens. since my teens i have been seeking a way out of this country but because of my mental health, i can not be as explosive or creative, useful or impressive. i don't have friends hat help me play, jsut an annoying family situation where i feel stuck and disgusted. i don't want to live anymore but that is not an option. it won't fix or improve anything just create more pain so what am i? i am so tired... i fear i will never get a chance nless i pull something off but to expect so much from myself out of fear and desperation is maybe why i am still sick. i guess i may just need to give up on trying to be great? if i am not good enough then all i can do is just suffer through ",0

"a long depressing year. it all started going downhill friday the 17th of december 2 21, when i got caught buying 2gs of weed at a park at night and a fucking cunt of a police man who wasnt on parole decided to ""work"" all of a sudden. im italian, here is illegal to buy weed and the police is obsessed with it. i study medicine, im not a degenerate and spending time chasing weed smokers is a fucking waste of time, but thats how it is here oldest population in the world . medical cannabis is avalible but only 1 place in italy produces it, so it costs 8 per month to people with sla, alzheimer, parkinson, chronic pain ecc... a violent fucking system. i was an activist for the legalization of this substance, but the old people in the justice system couldnt give a fuck about 1 million signatures. they took my id and now every time the police stops me they search for drugs on me. i had a girlfriend at the time. she helped me a little at the beggining of the year, but my depression grow bigger and bigger, i just wanted to die this winter. ive had many abusive friends, my gf wasnt better. in the 2.5 years we were together i helped her getting out of depression and was always avalible for her when she had insomnia. her ex boyfriend was 28 when she was 15. she never admitted to be a victim of a pedophile and every time a therapist told her so she just changed therapist and started all over again. no cbt, just untrustworthy psycoanalyst. she had been super possessive over me and drowned me in her loneliness. she was never a sociable person so she could float in that post covid situation, but i couldnt. i spent every, every fucking night with her. i really loved her because she was my little precious person, i gave my everything to her. she gave me back nothing when i needed it. no love, no comprehension, no affection, every time i showed my depression she got upset, like she just wanted me to help her and didnt want someone with problems because she already had many. man i felt like a turd. my gf, the person i loved so much, i gave my all to, just wouldnt help me. couple of months later she dumped me like the biggest piece of trash. i still remember the look of disgust she had towards me just for having a major depressive episode. how could i waste so much time on someone who doesn't even put any effort in helping me back. i lost all my erasmus friends with covid they went back to their country and i live far away from home. i couldnt make any new ones because of my gf and how passive i was in the relationship we lived in the same campus, basically together . i also spent 26 days in isolation in a remote hotel covid with no internet, shitty food and cockroachers, because i caught the virus and the campus couldnt handle me apparantly. i understood how fucking dehumanizing prison is. when she dumped me, i started cbt but became addicted with benzodyazepines, though i started taking ssri so i could get out of bed, finally. the problem is that i became totally apathetic, i started fighting outside clubs to feel something. never i had done such things. its like all the hidden aggression caused by previos trauma was the only thing i could feel. got in many troubles. i also couldnt study properly, so i didnt really perform at exams but luckily i still managed to keep following a lazy, but better than nothing schedule. this summer i met many people and i thought that finally therapy was working, but man young people here are so untrustworthy, everyvone i swear tried to use me for money or as a fuel for their narcisisim. only a few were decent enough to have a proper nice simple open conversation. the mysanthropism that i try my best to repress is one of the worst thing i have experienced. now i will go back to my campus, lonely, with tons of work to do, addictions, insomnia, a broken heart, uncertainty for the future due to war and inflation and climate change, stress and anxiety. i know there is a lot worse and this just makes me more depressed but i just cant solve this question: why live? ""i just can't seem to find an answer to what i'm living for, in general i can't keep living like this it's breaking my heart, day by day. it's getting harder and harder to mask my pain i can't tell if i wanna live or if i wanna die please, save me""",0

"been dating for 4 months and broke up with her four times. this is my first post in reddit and sorry english aint my first language. i was diagnosed with bipolar hypomania or mixed episodes like a year ago after being misdiagnosed with social anxiety and major deppression for five years. i didnt even know what bipolar was until i had a roomate that had that condition but i never even was aware if i was having high or lows. i was unaware for a while until i had a nervous breakdown a year ago and decided to go to three psychiatrists that diagnosed me as bipolar and i started taking depakote. in terms of relationships ive never had a girlfriend, only one time and it was long distance and it lasted a month because we both had numerous issues. ive had a lot of casual sex with numerous partners mostly in my manic times and done numerous drugs and had risky behaviour, i just realized ive been doing this a year ago. so, to get to the point, ive been trying to stop my medication and stop seeing my psychiatrist , i know is a bad idea, three months ago which is around the same time i met this girl. when i met her through a friend we went to my place and nothing happened but then saw her two weeks later and hooked up, things started going really fast as it usually does and we were spending weekends together and going out on dates. i started getting needy and clingy and professing my love for her which she didnt correspond as she was coming out a relationship and she just wanted to hang out. so all this and the fact that i was reducing my meds was bringing up minor manic episodes at times when i would become paranoid and jealous and start pushing her away as i always do. i broke up with her the first time cause i thought we would better be friends, the i called her an hour later for her to come over. the second time was because she arrived late and then she was anxious so we made up. third time was because i started to feel more attached and feared that i might lose her. and now the fourth time this weekend because i thought she was with some other guy which it should be cool because we only dating but i keep feeling that everyone out there is there to get me. i went to her house with flowers and chocolates even though she blocked me and explained to her that im bipolar and although its not a excuse i like her a lot and sometimes is out of my control and i dont mean it, that i want her in my life and that i really love being with her. she said she us not a tennis ball to keep bouncing on the wal and that she is really hurt and felt like i will keep doing this all the time and she was crying and very upset with me which i understand. she said she might think it over the weekend to see if she takes me back i honestly think she would be better off without me as im a complete mess and i think things just might get worse, although i realized many bipolar relationships, the bipolar person is always pushing the other person away. i dont wanna keep doing this, especially not witth this girl, but she says that now she is going to be scared of anything that she says or does because i might dump her and that she will not be able to be herself. i really dont want her to feel that way, i want her to be free and not locked down on my emotional mess. i have to let her go but part of me still cares a lot about her, i just dont want to make her cry ever again or hurt her. i feel like a jerk for playing with her feelings. i know dropping my meds is a really bad idea but i miss my old self and wanna have a heathy relationship but im even scared of myself as im usually self centered and unaware. never dated a girl more than three months which of course is a red flag, wanted to see if anybody else identifies or see me as a complete wacky.",0

"child with depression. short story.. i a 29f dealt with depression as long as i can remember but didn t realize what it was till after i turned 18. too long of a story to tell right now. anyways i m medicated now after trial and errors so i m okay. well now i have a 9f daughter that as i see the signs that i use to have when i was younger might suffer the same fate. she s had very few maybe like 2 or three really bad episodes in the past of just extreme sadness and crying every few minutes. i try my best to comfort her but sometimes i feel like i don t know what to do as when i had depression my mom had it but her and my dad hid it from us because it was just all in her head i had nobody to help me. so my question is what kind of help or ideas can y all help me with to help to better comfort her? besides medicine because she s too young, but i refuse to let my child be left alone to deal with it because i know from experience and it s a scary place. i m just scared because i want her to value life and know that she will always have someone there to understand what she goes through, it just kills me to know i passed it on to her. she s only 9 and she is already showing signs.",0

"some questions regarding paxil. i've been on 3 mg of paxil daily for the last two years. recently, my prescription ran out and my prescriber was on vacation so it didn't get refilled. by day 2 of cessation i started getting really dizzy and neaseous. i found some stray pills laying around under my nightstand so i popped 6 mg to stave off the withdrawal and now i feel even worse. so one, should i have just taken the 3 mg and if so, would it have even helped? and two, i have a full bottle of lexapro left from when i was taking that. if i switch to the lexapro for now until i get my paxil refilled, will that avoid withdrawal? edit: typo",0

"my most sincere testimony. based on the posts i ve seen here i think that this sub might be the best place for an introvert like me to fully open and release himself. sincere thanks to everyone who will manage to read my whole post. i m a 24 year old man from a middle eastern europe. since i live in central europe, the viewpoints, cultures and lifestyles here are very divided some people i know are of neoliberal democratic viewpoint pro biden clinton, anti trump putin,etc. and other ones mostly people from theirs 4 s onwards share social democratic patriotic viewpoint anti biden clinton, pro trump putin,etc. ... this division is seen as well among my family and friends. my father is a fundamental baptist fatalist he says that this world is one big political machinery and an ultimate satanic deception, he expects jesus s second arrival soon to destroy this planet by fire for good. sometimes he tells me very clearly that he wants to die and be finally with the lord. my mum easily falls for conspiracy theories, refuses us to get covid vaccinated, reads alternative media and facebook posts for whole day, etc... what am i? a big mess simply said.. from the age of 16 to 21 my father raised me as a baptist as well. i was a sincere believer in jesus christ, i was sharing the gospel to my friends and even classmates at the university believing i might be saving them from eternal damnation if they decided to believe . in order to become a good follower of christ i studied bible, theology and history in my leisure time and at the age of 18 i signed up for studying history at the university believing it would strengthen my faith even more. well, the opposite became the truth. i realized my whole perception of history was fairytailed. the biggest milestones were learning about the evolution, prehistory and the political aspect of dissemination of christian religion which was often done by violence charlemagne s conquests, teutonic crusades in the baltic, spanish inquisition, recatholization,etc. ... by the time i started learning more about evolution and biblical contradictions in my spare time and then i finally deconverted in 2 2 . in hopes of achieving freedom from religious limitations, only then i realized i m lost. since my brain had been used to elaborate every life concept from baptist perspective for 5 years, the remnants of my past faith are still present in my mind until today. i try to consider every aspect of life with a critical and rational unbiased mind to come to the most objective and right conclusions. however it is very hard because there is still an irrational side of my brain that wants to evaluate things emotionally by christian ethics and that is how i got to know what is anxiety, the worst feeling you can possibly experience. when rational thinking collides with my past biblical opinions and interpretations, that s when it hits. and i have these collisions everyday at every topic possible, whether it s science, history, morals, enviroment, vaccines, etc... i realized i needed a professional help so i was attending a psychiatrist for a year. he prescribed me antidepressants encouraging me that these medicaments would make me feel relieved and in a few months these mental struggles would be over. first half a year i took escitil and the second half i took alventa. even though they are supposedly strong antidepps, they didn t help me at all. that s why, after a year of treatment and spending big money i decided to seize using his services and currently am very skeptical about pharmacy industry overall. how does my life look like now? recurring mental struggles; i hate my father because due to his brainwashing i lost 5 years of my life devoted to delusion and especially my teen years which are essential on brain development during the adolescence period; experiencing trauma when thinking about my christian past; masturbating on daily basis because that s the only natural thing that gives me relief and inner peace which i so desperately seek; and lastly i m completely lost. i don t want to fall into any religious bs or hyper conspiracy theories anymore, but as a critical observer i have to say this world just doesn t seem to operate naturally for me.. there is a propaganda in the us and in europe as well, including my country. there is a certain concrete viewpoint our governments want us to hold on topics like covid, ukraine, russia, refugee crisis, multiculturalism, entertainment industry which is rigidly pushed by the mainstream mass media. it s a political agenda or at least, that s my opinion. we re living in the age of information and with so many contradictory knowledge and opinions going from all sides, it is no wonder some people choose to follow alternative media or conspiracy theories.. are we living in a natural world or a matrix? it is because i ve studied the arguments of both sides that i m lost... what is the truth? do you believe there is an absolute truth and is worth to devote our lives to it? is the concept of absolute truth dangerous because it produces fanatics as my dad is and i was?... you know, i guess it doesn t even matter, in the end, we all share a common destiny, the death. the only thing that makes our lives different is how our life paths will shape towards this irreversible destiny. some people experience a joyful life, some experience a sorrowful life. thanks for reading ",0

"morning exclusive depression. so as of lately i ve been suffering with absolutely terrible morning depression and i have no idea what to do to fix it. it started about 2 weeks ago out of nowhere and now seems like it ll never end. the second i wake up i start panicking and just think of nothing but terrible things. i suddenly feel like everything i ve loved is meaningless to me, like i want to quit my job and just fade away. i m hysterical from the second i wake up until mid day. i ve never really cried but now i wake up every morning and cry hysterically on and off for hours to the point of getting psychically nauseous and a massive headache. but then noon comes around and i feel fine, but then i m just always so exhausted from having such bad morning episodes that i end up going to sleep like 4 hours earlier than i usually do, which is another thing i m upset about when i wake up. i ve stopped seeing my therapist because of an insurance issue and i just have no idea what to. it just keeps getting worse every day. i keep trying to do things that usually make me happy like listening to my favorite music or watching my favorite movies but then it just makes it worse because i start thinking i don t even like this anymore i just have no idea what to do or when this will end",0
"just when things look to be going well.. things were finally starting to look up. husbad finally got a new job, i loved mine, starting next month we would be saving money instead of being pay check to paycheck and borrowing from family to make ends meet. then i get the call that i'm let go from my job. apparently a couple clients were saying that i was rude to them on phone and said things that i never said. all this because they didn't hear what they wanted to hear. also apparently there were other issues that were never brought to my attention to even try to fix. after working there for over a year. last time they brought up an issue i fixed it, i dont see why that wasn't an option this time and why they even thought i'd do what was said. now i'm trying to find a new job that has a similar pay hard to find in my area most jobs here dont pay well . i don't know how much more shit i can take.",0
"i rescued a kitten over a month ago and since having him here my depression has gotten worse.. i just need to get this off my chest since i don't really have any other place to vent. i feel uncomfortable talking to my family about it because i know i'm just worrying and burdening them but i'm genuinely losing my mind. my next therapy session is in 2 weeks after like 3 months of there not being space for me. i also recently got officially diagnosed with adhd and i'm going through a transitional period since i've just graduated uni and i started a new job, so my mind's been a bit of a mess lately. so the actual story: a bit over a month ago i found a kitten with no mom, no siblings. he was all alone and in rough shape. i took him in and i've been taking care if him ever since. originally he was supposed to be a foster. i've taken him to the vet and he's on his way to being fully vaccinated and soon to be fixed too. like i'm taking the well being of this kitten very seriously since i'm his main and basically only caretaker. i really want what's best for him. unfortunately for me this means i've kind of abandoned my own well being? taking care of this kitten has take everything out of me. all my free time is dedicated to him since he needs to play with someone since he's all alone. he needs to be taken care of since he's only a baby and i don't resent him for that. i can't, it's not his fault. but i am exhausted. my sleeping schedule has been altered since i've had him. again, my free time is dedicated to him and when i'm not home i'm thinking about how to better take care of him. i have abandoned all the hobbies i used to ground myself because i can't do them with him around since he always wants to be with me interrupting anything i'm doing. i've considered finding him a home right after he is fixed since i know this isn't sustainable for me mental health wise but my dad says no one is gonna want him if he's too old. my mom wants me to keep him because she likes him but i'm the only one who takes care of him. i'm the one who has to be with him all the time. i know his kitten behavior isn't forever and he's actually a really good cat but i'm at my wits end. i'm always angry, always sad, always feeling bitter and miserable after i started getting better. like i keep crying out for help but only receive ""but he's so cute and such a good cat, hang in there"". i'm also concerned that if i do give him out for adoption, there's no guarantee that whoever adopts him has his best interest at mind and doesn't take proper care of him, mistreats him or even abandons him. they could promise they'll take care of him but people lie all the time. i don't know. i know i'm getting ahead of myself and making a bigger deal of the whole situation but i'm so tired and it has triggered a relapse.",0

"my mental health is just spiraling. idk what to do, therapy isn't a option at all rn. i cry and breakdown pretty much every single day. im literally stuck in the past and can't get out. i went through so much trauma at 14 for months and didn't realize until a few months ago and now it's starting to sink in how bad it was. im currently 19 and havent done shit with my life. i have no job, no license, no skills, nothing. all i do is sit around playing video games and watch tv cause it's the only things that give me peace rn. i barely have friends, i tend to get ghosted and left by ""close friends"" and it's made it to where i just don't give a fuck anymore. i literally put in so much effort just to get abandoned and treated like shit. it hurts. it's happened so much. i just can't do all this anymore. i just lay down listening to sad music thinking about past memories for hours every day. i can't move past them. i wish i could go back in time. im hella fucking depressed and it's just getting worse by the day. now im just moody af and irritable all the time. i get so angry and stay mad for hours and lash out at everything and then feel such strong guilt after. i feel useless. i feel like i wont ever escape from my own head. ive tried so many things to boost my mental health and it doesn't help. im so confused in life and wish i had it figured out but i don't. i don't think there's anything good for me coming from this life.",0

"i hate the feeling of going through life alone. i hate feeling like i'm going through life alone. i hate how everyone is busy. every day i have nobody to share my thoughts with, nobody to joke around with. i have had the opportunities to make friends with other people, but it didn't work out. i don't really know why. maybe they were shy, maybe they just didn't like me that much or feel comfortable around me, but i always felt like i was the one carrying the conversation and all the interactions. amp; x2 b; for some reason it seems like everyone is either a dick or just really boring. like, most people around me basically say nothing at all when i hang out with them and just expect me to entertain them or something, i don't know. and the only people who aren't boring are not boring in a d ish kind of way that makes me feel like i always have to be on my toes and can't relax. i just don't really get it. all i want is a friend, a daily face to face friend, ideally multiple friends. how did we screw up society so badly where one of the most basic psychological needs seems to much harder to attain now than 1 , years ago probably? .",0

"dealing with depression when you lose your only social, physical and creative outlet all at once.. i have been depressed for a very long time, and was extremely suicidal 2 years ago. i went to a bridge with the intent to jump off it. anyway i found something that i became extremely passionate about which also acted as a social outlet, a way to do physical activity every single day and a way to creatively express myself, and this led me to become truly happy for the first time in a long time. this activity is skateboarding. it helped me make new friends and actually built my non existent confidence up to be able to talk to people i don't know. about 3 months ago i thought i got an ankle sprain which google told me would last about a month. well 3 months later and it hasn't gotten any better. turns out i have tendinitis which causes me extreme physical pain and mental anguish. i have slipped back into old ways, spending all day on the computer and not answering my friends when they want to hang out. amp; x2 b; i know that my mental health is deteriorating but at the same time i feel completely helpless to escape my terrible situation. the doctor said that i should do another 3 months of no physical activity and i don't know what i'm gonna do. rot away in my room most likely. i've already had suicidal thoughts come back and i find it hard to sleep at night. this isn't asking for help or advice i just felt the need to vent about my problems. oh yeah and the worst part is when if i get better it'll be the depths of winter which is when you can't skate anyway and when my depression is the worst. anyway this post is more for myself i feel a bit better after typing it all out thanks byexoxoxox",0

normal activities. it s like every night i want to kill myself and the next morning i act like nothing happened. i just sit in bed for hours thinking and contemplating things and writing but it all feels pointless because i m never going to do anything like reach out. i don t think i have the guts to tel my parents or anyone close how i really feel because i can t be bothered and hate the attention that i would receive. i come home from school and just go to my room and eat dinner. my grades and eveything are good and on paper i should be happy and my life should be great yet i always feel depressed no matter how great of a day i have. it s like having no reason for being sad in and of itself is a reason for being sad. i can t explain it well but it s like i have a momentary lapse of motivation which is engulfed by reality leaving me to just do nothing at all. i just do what i m told like a robot and don t question it because it s easier that way. i hope some people agree. i d rather suffer in silence than draw the attention of others and have them perceive me or look at me a certain way.,0

i m tired of society. the fact that people even try to diminish my accomplishments losing 7 pounds and getting fit and in shape makes me feel like going to the gym and keeping my diet isn t even worth it sometimes. idk why i have to look to people for confirmation and even when it s a positive comment the negatives outweighs the positive in my mind. self esteem and confidence is low. i go hours without checking my phone cause i m afraid of people saying something negative. social media is just so negative. if you re not perfect then it s not enough no matter how far you ve come. i m exhausted.,0

did therapy help?. so i've had some free sessions of counseling offered and it can feel nice at first to get things off my chest even though i struggle with paranoia and people's judgements of me. i've noticed there was some immediate catharsis felt when i've spoken of childhood trauma and receive some compassion and empathy in return. however after the session i felt heavy and weighted down the rest of the week like it conjured up the wounds to feel fresh and i had a renewed sense of anger. i don't know if those are necessary grief processes you have to go through when you start talking it out and then after a certain amount of time you're supposed to be healed and not affected anymore by it. but the therapy overall hasn't seemed to have made much change. i'm also looking into joining some zoom meetings for acoas and looking into getting a mentor or sponsor i'm not sure how that works or if those are offered in those meetings. i'd prefer one on one but i feel like i would benefit from being around others who had similar childhoods as myself.,0

"i m seriously at the end of my rope.. my life is in complete shambles. i m closing in on 4 , i m massively overweight 28 , bald, have very few friends, don t see or talk to my family as often as i d like, have a few grand in the bank and need periodic help from my father to keep up with the cost of living. i gave up chasing my dream job because i m lazy and didn t want to put in the grind to get where i wanted to go. i have no life insurance, no stocks, no 4 1k, no savings. my house is basically my only asset. i changed careers to something easy that obviously doesn t pay great and told myself it s because i wanted to settle down and start a family. i married an alcoholic and compulsive liar, who ended up making life a drunken hell, went to rehab, and started sleeping with someone she met there. she brought this man into our marital bed every chance she got, even after i found out, and that only stopped because she was going to be kicked out of the house by the courts and him not being on the property was a condition of her staying in the house. since then, she s left every single weekend to go off and be with this other man while i ve been left at home to take care of our five year old daughter and wait for the divorce process to play out. she leaves before i get home on friday and walks in on sunday like it s the most normal thing in the world. at work, i smile through the day, but all i hear are stories about everyone s families husbands, children, people going on maternity leave and think about how that s all been ripped away from me. no one is telling cute stories about me or things i did for them or the family. there are no siblings for my daughter to learn and experience life with. i m all she s got, sad to say. i feel terrible for her for getting dealt such a lousy hand. i m reminded constantly on social media of people with their families and their spouses and their kids and their trips, and i feel like my life is basically one note and more or less over. i have no prospects for more family. i have no money for fancy trips. people i was colleagues with in my past profession have reached the pinnacle i dreamt of years ago. they re there and i m not. i m reminded of their success constantly. i have no one to blame but myself, but i have no way to make up for past mistakes. the job involves traveling and odd hours, and that s something i m not in position to do as sole guardian and eventual custody plan, and probably never will be. at night, either me or my wife puts our daughter to bed. if she does it she stays upstairs and goes to sleep. if i do it, she goes to bed herself before i finish. every single night i am alone with no one to talk to, nothing to look forward to, no plans to make. dating apps just serve to remind me how unwanted i am. the few that do respond typically ghost within a day or two. every single i meet in the real world is either married, engaged, or has a boyfriend. just as well, as i have absolutely nothing to offer them anyway. a broken family, a pale, obese, bald physique, and a few bucks. awesome. the ladies sure are jumping at that. if it wasn t for my daughter i don t know where i d be right now. i don t see any point to any of this if she wasn t in the picture. i m barely a blip on the radar to the vast majority of people, including the people i d consider close. i don t reach out and no one reaches out to me. if i wasn t here, no one except my little girl would notice. what the fuck am i supposed to do. i want to hit reset because everything is too fucked up to salvage. my life needs to be burnt to the ground and demoed. there s no saving this. i m the single suckiest, most toxic, worthless person i know. can someone tell me: what s the point ? ? yeah, my kid, of course. but she s just going to grow up and eventually see me for the loser i am. i am wasting my life and it s at least half over. i hate myself.",0
"girl i ve been dating for 6 months says she doesn t want a relationship suddenly and ask to be left alone.. so, i met this girl 24 i m 27yr old male on tinder. really cool girl. went on a couple of dates. she was very keen and very interested in me. on our third date she wanted to make plans to go on vacation with me in november. on the 2nd month. she revealed that she has depression, attempted suicide when she was young and was on medication. kept an open mind, proceeded to see each other every weekend. for 3 months. 4 5th month decided we needed to spend time with friends so only saw each other 2 3 weekends. we went on vacation together in two different countries for two weeks. but, when we got back from said vacation. she expressed that her depression was getting worse due to a sudden crisis and fear of her future . only seen her once on after vacation, for a date which she almost blew me off. i tried not to take it personally and i ve been there for her. gave her some space whilst checking in. texts were cold. only spoke to me out of convenience. a full 18 . then had a mini breaking point where i asked to go on a city break next week since it s been 3 weeks since we spent a weekend. i expressed that quality time is important to me and it would be nice to spend some time. she then goes i don t want a relationship or anything tbh. so i don t think we should talk anymore. even though we were just planning a trip to an island on november and october. like, last week. i then said okay, i understand . i want to be here and i don t want to give up and i wish we could talk . she then says i m stressed so please leave me be. in which i replied, i m sorry i m making you feel this way, whenever you wanna talk about things, i m just here. the end. i care about this girl a lot and i love her and i ve been reading around. it s not like she didn t love me either. i don t want it give and i want to fight the best way possible. any tips out there guys. i m backing off for now until she ever reaches out to me. tbh, i have been very financially supportive since our time together and have had amazing experiences. but, i believe that has also been a bad thing. i don t want her to feel i m not there but how can i be present in her life without pressuring her. she s beautiful and super confident. but, she is vulnerable and i see through it sometimes.",0

"i don t even know what to call this feeling anymore. m,2 i don t even know how to start typing this. i don t know how to begin explaining the way i feel. i honestly do not think i should be here on the internet complaining about my life but i just don't have anyone to talk to about this right now. the only guy i would even think to try to open up to about all this is currently hammered out of his mind, and i love that for him, he deserves to blow off the steam, but tonight my mind is just everywhere and nowhere and shutting itself down all at once and i just need to get it out somewhere that isn't just my head because it is killing me. for starters, i suppose i am worthless. i am not particularly good at anything. i am not good in conversation. despite my efforts, i often find that i am inconsiderate and often times it is a result of my own stupidity lack of awareness. i can't make people laugh like i used to. i feel like all my friends look at me differently these days. i feel like my social skills have regressed across the board, as i can barely converse with my co workers ive been working this job for close to 7 months , i enjoy eating nothing, i can barely convince myself to go to the gym anymore, and the list goes on but my god. i just dont know. i feel foolish for crying sometimes. if my family knew, if my friends knew... i feel like a failure. i feel as though i've just allowed myself to become a piece of shit and i am genuinely afraid because no matter how loud i scream at myself to turn the lights on again, i just can't do it. i feel lonely and i just cant find joy in so many things anymore. my favorite songs dont fire me up anymore, i usually can't even sit through them in their entirety now. ive gone to therapy before and taken anti depressant medication before as well, and i cant afford to pay for one without the help of my parents, who do not know the way i truly feel. i love them and i feel horrible for not being honest with them about it, but i just cant compromise the remaining fa ade that im doing better these days. i cant count how many times ive tried to kick myself and get back on the wagon, but i just cant hold on. i am scared that i wont break the cycle. i know there are hundreds of thousands of people who dont. i hate myself for allowing this to happen, and at the same time i no longer have the passion or energy to hate anything. i can feel my opinions on any given subject turning from whatever firm position they were to nothing, to carelessness. i feel as though i am the worst type of person, not a protagonist, not an antagonist, not even a side character or a fucking extra in a movie. i feel like the lone viewer of a movie no one gave a fuck about, and yet i can't will myself to leave the theater already. it is times like this when i think back to better times, before i was even aware of the social constructs that and responsibilities that bog me down now, and those memories don't even feel like they're from my lifetime. at best it feels as though i watched it happen to someone else, or perhaps that it was one of those good dreams you try all day to remember better. i don't even know what kind of advice to ask for here, i think i just needed to get the thoughts out. if this type of post isn't what normally would belong in this subreddit then i apologize and understand if it is removed. if you have read through to the end, thank you, truly. have a wonderful day",0

what the fuck do i do?. literally what do you do when you re so severely depressed for six years straight and you cannot afford to go to therapy and you do not have insurance and you don t even have a photo id to get an appointment first place. literally every single day i want to die actively. at this point i m literally looking for reasons to stay i have 1 left. literally only one reason to keep living. i am so unbelievably tired of it. i am so painfully self aware of all my problems but i can do nothing to fix them. i get my id in december but i honestly don t think i can hold out for 5 more months. i m so fucking tired.,0
"how do i know if my ssris are working?. i am a 21 year old male and been on ssris for 8 weeks now. i'm very unsure if the meds are actually working, and i don't even know how they are supposed to work. i will try to compare different things associated with depression before taking the meds and now. sleep before: some nights i could not sleep at all. other nights i slept around 3 4 hours. after: i sleep a little bit better now. i fall asleep easier, and i sleep around 6 8 hours. however i don't feel rested when i wake up, which make me think that the sleep i get is low quality. energy before: very low energy. could not get started studying for my exams. many hours of the day used in bed. after: i still don't feel like i have enough energy. i do however function on a kind of autopilot that takes me out of bed in the morning and keeps me going through the day. but my energy is still low and not normal levels. depressive thoughts before: feelings of hopefulessness. constantly thinking that nobody likes me, and that will always be the case. thinking that i will always be alone, and that this way of life is not worth it. feeling like i lost myself and i will never find myself again. hating myself. feeling that absolutely everyone is better than me, and that people are better off without me. after: no changes here. i still have these thoughts. however a little less frequently, and when i do have these thoughts, i feel like there are so much thoughs in my brain that i don't have the energy or time to explore them all right now. low episodes and self harm before: some very low episodes where i lost some of my control. wanted the thoughts to go away and feel something different. self harmed to accomplish this. sometimes excessive use of alcohol to keep away from self harm. after: the first 3 weeks of using ssri i experienced these low episodes more frequently. after 5 weeks i have not experienced this anymore. however when i experienced these lows i was alone and could do whatever i wanted to. now i'm surrounded by family because im on vacation, and i cannot let my family know that i'm depressed. so i do not have the same opportunities to experience these lows. the fact that i also don't have the time or energy to explore my depressive thoughts make these low episodes less likely. i think that if i were alone right now, i might still get these low episodes with self harm. isolating before: isolated from other people because i feel like the worst version of myself, and i don't want to be a burden for people. also felt like i have nothing to contribute with. not funny and didn't contribute to conversations. after: no change. still isolating for the same reasons. loss of interest in hobbies before: not enjoying my hobbies. not getting the joy i used to get from doing things. after: no change. amp; x2 b; summary i'm unsure if the ssris are working for me because i still feel depressed. my depressive thoughts are still there, my energy is still low. i sleep a little bit better, but the sleep i get is low quality. i still isolate myself from others, and my hobbies don't give me energy or joy. i have not self harmed in 3 weeks though. this might be because of the antidepressives, but it might also just be because that i am on vacation and spend time with my family which keeps me occupied from depressive thoughts. but the thoughst are still there, and if i were alone i think i would have enough time to explore my depressive thoughts and expereince low episodes of self harm.",0
"the worst thing about suicidal thoughts. i think, that the worst thing about having suicidal thoughts every 2 minutes for 5 years is the knowledge that, if i haven't killed myself by now, then i won't kill my self at all. its a really awful feeling, wanting to kill yourself but knowing you'll never go through with it.",0

"ways ideas to get out of bed in the morning?. i'm 25 and for lack of a better word i feel so lost numb. i have had a very rollercoaster kind of year. i've been feeling like i've been in a downward plunge these past few months. i've recently moved in with my brother to help with his care. i at least try and get out of bed to help him with his needs, but the amount of willpower it takes to just not lay in bed and not move is immense. i'm just so tired of feeling like this. i'm willing to try anything. can anyone leave ideas or things i can do to try and i guess just make the day a less.... despressing?",0

"i wish i had been an abortion. you know that sense of accomplishment you get when you worked hard on something? i don't get that feeling. if i don't enjoy the process of something then i get no reward out of any part of it. the only thing that could motivate me is social approval. but who wants to spend hours honing a talent or a skill just to impress other people? it's not actually that motivating. imagine everything in your life feels like brushing your teeth. you don't feel a sense of accomplishment after you do it and you don't get special enjoyment out of the process. but you do get to experience fewer cavities years down the line. the human mind is not particularly wired to pursue those kinds of goals. the first time i was able to support myself, the first time i was able to buy a car, those times i pass the few college classes i've taken... i'm just now realizing that those things give other people some kind of special feeling. i've complained in past posts about how i'm not competitive and i don't care about money and i wish i could just be a cashier. i don't fit into society and i don't like its rules. i didn't ask for any of this.",0

"not sad,not mad, .just done. why is suicide so commonly looked at as bad? maybe sometimes it really is the only way out i had a decent childhood not great but not terrible, i spent most of my childhood not feeling wanted by anyone, that is no way for anyone to feel especially a child. i join the military right out of high school, it was the best decision i could ve made at the time. i was in the air force and spent most of my time deployed to various locations throughout the world most of which were not very safe. i was married from 2 to 22 to a british lady. it did not in badly but it did end. three days after my divorce was final i married my current wife. i remained in the military until i found out that i was going blind and was medically retired. i bounce between a few jobs and finally landed on a civilian contract position. i worked there for the past 15 years and in december found out my eyes were too bad to drive so i had to give up yet another career because of my blindness i drink a lot throughout my young adult life, enough that it almost ended everything. i have been sober for going on for years now with a few hiccups in between i have not had a touch of alcohol since november which is a big deal for me. now that i m retired and spending all of my time at home i find myself not wanting to do any of it anymore. i m not necessarily suicidal which i have done many times in the past, i am just done living this life i m not sure where to go or what to do, i ve had therapy for the last five years and they seem to just bounce me back and forth between different medication s. i have raised three successful adults and had a 23 year marriage all of which i consider very big accomplishments. at this point i find myself alone and not wanting to carry on like everything is normal. again, i am not sad, i m not mad, i am just done who says suicide has to be looked at negatively? over the years i have had friends that have taken their own lives, and kind of a sick way i was always jealous of their success. i understood more than most how it felt to just be done. i don t think i m posting this as a cry for help, i think i m posting it so that others may see that what they are thinking isn t all that abnormal. thank you for taking the time to read my post.",0

"does this make me a failure?. i am 14 years old, and i wasted the best opportunity of my life and i wanted to know am i a failure because 3 months ago i lived in a stockton with my grandparents and i had put them through so much stress ex. sneaking out, smoking weed, stealing their car, ran away for a night, getting the cops called on me multiple times and i was being stupid and reckless which was my fault and i had gotten the opportunity of a life time by moving to lacey washington with my aunt and uncle and their 3 children and it was everything i could've asked for love, attention, basketball, etc. like when i was there it had been the best 3 months of my life, i was able to go to great wolf lodge, i saw former nba players and it was all feeling right to be there but, the first month i got there i got in trouble i had taken a video of my cousin starting to fall asleep with this filter on and i sent it to this group chat with her friends in it and that was funny don't get me wrong but it was unnecessary like i had just got sat down and my uncle talked to me it was nothing really major then i really got in huge trouble i had got head by this girl, and i recorded it and word got around soon her mother found out and the mother pressed charges and my aunt and uncle was understanding about that they knew it was just a mistake and meanwhile all this is going on i'm smoking weed and that was a problem from the start because my uncle grew up like me and he always caught me when i was high so he kinda understood the problem like he knew i was getting high to cope with my problems and we were going to do counseling for that and they kept asking me ""do you want to be here?"" and i said yes and everything had gone well for a good 2 weeks until i stole money out of my cousins wallet and i took 2 dollars and i thought that was that, like i was just going to get over but the very next morning my uncle came in and told me that 4 dollars was missing now i had the opportunity to put the 2 dollars back and be honest that i don't know what happened to the other 2 because i truly didn't but i didn't, and they kinda understood everything like i had problems that i needed to cope with and they knew what i was doing at the time was just making reckless decisions at the time but what really had them question themselves about me living with them was me stealing from my cousin because stealing from your family especially with them is the ultimate disrespect and i was just worried about getting high in that moment and now that i'm sitting here crying my eyes i realize it wasn't worth it at all. like throughout all the times when i was high, making reckless and impulsive decisions. it wasn't worth it at all none of this shit was. and it is 3 months later and when they sat down and told me that i was leaving they told me that i can't feel like a failure or it's gonna hold me back my whole life, and that i'm not a failure it just didn't work out, but i can't help and think. does this make me a failure for wasting the one of best opportunities of my life?",0
"everyone who ever hurt me gets to be happy today. i came to the realization that some people were born lucky and some unlucky, and that life is simply not fair. hang on with me for this one. all my life, i went through trauma after trauma. from my parents' emotional abuse of my siblings and me or simply my dad abusing my mom in every kind of way possible, to shitty relationships with friends, romantic partners, and family. i want to talk about a specific story. about a year ago, my younger cousin did something to me that i will never forget nor forgive. i always knew she and her family weren't good people, they always seemed mischievous and mean in my opinion but what can i say, it's ""family"" and my dad cares about his sister and her kids a lot, even though they are terrible people. so i was forced to stay in contact with them. as i was visiting family, her mother and she made a plan to put me in deep trouble. we had a sleepover and she must've seen me put my password into my phone, and while i was sleeping she went through it without my permission. she took screenshots of almost every single thing from private conversations to pictures, even the most private, and sent them to my family. all my family hated me they never liked my mom and my siblings in the first place, for allegedly ""stealing"" my dad so i guess it was just a way to create trouble between me and my dad . anyways i resent them today and they never apologized to me, mind you this was a year ago. they never got any punishments or sanctions whether it was from my dad who never took my side, from this stupid universe, or from god. why am i saying all this? i've always expressed my dreams to my family, especially a particular job that is still today my dream job. guess what? she got that job. she got it so easily, through parents and connections probably since she's still young and inexperienced. she's the happiest person alive even though she's evil. i've worked so hard, and never got anything. the point is, i have many stories like this, whether it's an ""ex fling"" who lied to me and hurt me badly by lying that he was single. i did what i thought was right by telling his girlfriend. guess what? they're still together today. he got to go back to his calm life while i was completely and still is broken by this situation. whether it's friendship, abusive relationships, bullying when i was younger, etc. people who did me wrong got nothing back whatsoever, which is probably one of the reasons why i do not believe in karma. i would like to note that everyone told me that ""i don't know what's going on behind doors, maybe they're unhappy"" please spare me this speech. i am not victimizing myself, nor just seeing ""the negative"", as surprising as it may sound, i've always been full of hope and the one to see the positive in every situation. i used to be very religious, until recently. i just couldn't do it anymore. i've always felt like god wasn't seeing me and abandoned me in a way. so what's the point of praying and hoping for the best when it simply just never comes? i'd like to mention that i've always been a positive person, very ambitious and determined, but i can only do this for so long... i ask every night what i did to deserve this. i can't help but wonder what is then the purpose of life, religion, karma. please do not bullshit me by saying that it gets better, it doesn't. i've been saying that it gets better for the past 6 years. it doesn't. i try every day, i work hard, and i try to be a good person but life keeps shitting on me. it's bullshit after bullshit and i never get a break. while those who hurt me, are the happiest people on earth and everything come so easy to them. i'd just like to have other people's perspectives on life and its purpose because the more i wake up each morning, the less i see any purpose.",0

"what is the point of all this?. i used to think if i worked hard to achieve success then it would make all the suffering of depression and anxiety worth it. in high school i got good grades. i took ap calc physics chem etc, 4. gpa, 149 sat, all that jazz. i thought hard work success. in college i realized that my understanding of hard work is naive. it doesn t just mean getting good grades, it means being courageous, networking, and having charisma. i decided to work on myself, go to the gym every day, read self help books, work on social skills, and meditate. i spent countless hours researching diet to optimize my health. i restrict my daily diet to only the most nutritious foods because i want to feel and look good. it all makes an incremental improvement to my depression. i m 21 and now i realize that hard work is necessary but not sufficient for success. it also requires luck. if i weren t so hyper focused on the end goal of success then i may have had a chance at realizing and capitalizing on the lucky opportunities that were presented to me. i m alone every day and i have no career path other than a useless degree in business. people laugh at my business degree as if i m stupid. i had scholarships to many schools including top ranked stem schools. i chose business because i m a strategic thinker with a broad set of skills that could enable me build more efficient systems from the top level. i got a minor in computer science so i can stay on the cutting edge of tech because i view programming and ml as an invaluable tool in business. however comp sci is not my passion in life so it isn t an option career. no business or employer gives a shit about any of that. they don t want someone to make their business more efficient , they want someone to follow the instructions and meet the status quo. i want change the status quo. they care about who i know and who i m friends with and which frat bro at the company will give me a reference. nepotism with extra steps. woe is me, right? i m not giving up, i m just bored of the same old shit over and over again. it s depressing. i ll have to start my own business to show them how it s really done.",0

"i think my selfhatred and depression have the se cause. i reject myself. and i do not know how to change it. i would like to accept myself and be okay and help others and creat stuff but my hatred prevents that from happening. i think my hatred has the same root as my depression: a lack of social interaction on a meaningful level. i feel very alone and excluded. i feel that i do not fit in. i am probably good at adapting and politeness thus i have a few colleagues with wome i can hang out from time to time. but these relationships feel not too close. i would rather have someone to whom i really feel close and intimate. it is like being trapped in a glass cube and put in a park full of people. seeing them having fun and social interaction, seemingly meaningful, is very mean since i can not reach this state and just have to watch. i think this lack is also due to my looks. i am very skinny and only average height, i suppose that is really not desired in a male. therefore i begun to hate and reject myself. also because i am not really talented in making conversation, finding new friends and just in general having social interactions. i am also shy and it always feels weird to talk to people. i always say something stupid and it haunts me afterwards.",0

"wanting to... my depression feels overwhelming right now and i'm not sure what to do for it. i've tried most medications and combinations of meds for depression anxiety, therapy doesn't help in the slightest and is expensive, i don't get much out of groups, and hospitals only taught me how to hide it better.... i've also tried hobbies, walks, and things to distract myself weed edibles, phone, and as of recently self harm... . i know my shits getting bad but i genuinely feel like nothing is going to make it better.. i've tried focusing on little things for sources of joy as well but the bits of happiness don't last very long. i might have some slice of happiness for 1 seconds then it's gone because dred takes over. i can't really enjoy anything.. i honestly wish i could purchase a gun but i'm unable to because in the state i'm in you have to have not been admitted to a mental hospital for the past 5 years; i was in one in 2 2 . at this point i feel like im either waiting until late 2 25 or until i'm overwhelmed to the point where physical pain doesn't stop me... my arm is currently covered in dried blood from cutting and i wish i could go deeper.. i just want peace..",0
"tired of feeling anxious. there s this underlying anxiety that i live with all the time and it exhausts me. anxiety and guilt colour all of my friendships and relationships, even the most loving and secure ones. it s just the worst, i don t know how to tell my best friends or family members about the intrusive thoughts i get about my relationships with them, ie, even when things are going well i feel like i need reassurance that they don t hate me or they won t leave me. i feel like i ve intellectualized figured out my issues so much that they should just go away on their own but that s not how it really works. i don t know what to do to fix it, i m not sure if i have bpd or bipolar ii or something else. i have never qualified for an mdd diagnosis so i haven t been able to be referred to a psychiatrist even though i ve been intensely suicidal multiple times in my life and would really like some professional help or medication or something. all i can do right now is take care of myself the best i can but i just wish i knew what more to do. if you got this far, thank you. just needed someone to talk to today.",0
"watching old people makes me depressed. because i'm gonna end up like this one day. lonely, trouble with moving and various health problems. watching young people have fun and smiling while sitting alone. telling myself i had the best years behind me while i'm miserable in my best years. i don't want to reach that point. once my parents are dead i don't have anyone close to me. i started developing suicide thoughts and i don't think i want to live past 3 let alone past 6 or more. i don't have anything to look forward to or any memories to look back to. my life has been a nightmare and a waste and everyday i pray someone would do me a favor and finish me off before i do it myself.",0
"did i give up everything that made me who i was?. i want to start by stating that i am 14 years old and entering high school. i know i have a lot of years ahead of me, but before you say something about how young i am, read this or don't . because i discuss about how i'm considering colleges, my age will correlate. i am sorry if i sound like a fool, but i just need to speak about this. i m so sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this and i will take the post down immediately if necessary. i used to have a lot of talent when i was young. i practiced piano, soccer, and art. i had so many interests and hobbies that set me apart from the others. however, i gradually stopped doing whatever i was good at because i ""didn't enjoy it."" i have now realized it's biting me in the ass. i now understand that it has been biting me in the ass for my entire life. these extracurricular activities are necessary for me to get into a decent college. what i like and what i don't like is irrelevant. they don t care, why would they care? i know i sound like a freak who only wants to be better than everyone else, but growing up, everyone expected you to be unique and special, and if you weren't, you were nothing. i simply feel so useless. because i'm a fucking lazy loser who stays at home all day playing video games, i let everything i was good at slip through my fingers, and now everyone my age is significantly better than me at everything. my mother frequently makes comparisons between myself and the talented and active in the arts daughter of a friend of mine. it aches. it hurts so bad. the pain of hearing that nothing i do is good enough for her is so great that i simply cannot describe it to you. i simply want to resume being excellent. i wish i had continued with it all, but i have no idea how to explain it without coming out as a fucking arrogant jerk. i try to be the best in all i do, yet i will never measure up to that level. i no longer exist.",0
"mom doesn t believe in my depression. i m here, still. i ve been doing as good as i can but even though i haven t been diagnosed by a professional i am almost certain i have depression. so here s my story and some of what i feel. some days i don t want to get out of bed, i m starting to hate some of the things i ve loved since as long as i can remember. i think i got depression at around 11 or 12. when i moved out of my old neighborhood and switched schools so i was away from most of my friends. all i remember from the moving process is a lot of crying, living in a basement with my mom and at the time former step dad who was a functioning alcoholic. they recently divorced at the time but still lived together he didn t leave until i was 15 but they married when i was 8. then when i was 13, i started having a very short temper, often having fits and breaking things and running away from home trying to go back to my neighborhood to see my friends, even though i returned to my old school things changed, i realized nobody there cared about me much and all i had to keep me happy was video games which my mom and school threatened to take away my xbox. when i was 14, in summer school i started a joke, and i became popular and things were doing so well, i was on the road to recovery and then it all fell apart, i became a huge target for bullying, nobody thought i was funny anymore, and i left after 8th grade. then my grandfather, who was one of my main father figures and my best friend died. when i was 15 i made a desperate attempt to save my life long dream, but by 16 my mom killed it. then my uncle who was my other father figure died. at that same time i was being bullied and harassed constantly online. this past year, at my yearly checkup at the doctors she offered me a depression test, before i had a chance to say yes my mom said i was fine and the doctor left the room. i asked my mom why she would do that and she said everyone has depression and we all get over it. all they ll do is make you take pills that do nothing for you, and that we choose to be depressed so i should quit bitching. i have trouble conversating with new people because i don t trust them, i don t shower very often or brush my teeth and she sort of makes fun of me by telling me i smell. i m almost 18 and she doesn t want to help me get a drivers license. i look in the mirror and just want to punch myself. i have more friends online then i do irl. i have to either sleep in bed with the dogs and my mom, or on the couch because she let my aunt and little cousin have my room. when i can i m going straight to treat ment, but she s making it hard because most of the money i earn from work she withdraws to pay her bills. i m honestly done with my life and i ll probably be gone within the next decade if i can t fix it.",0
"my life story and the reason why my depression started.. i am gonna share my life bc i have nothing better to do right now. so my 16f first tragic moment i remember is when my two year old brother died when i was almost 5. he died in an accident. at that age, i wasn't really aware of what death was but still, i remember being sad and crying a lot. i still feel sad when i remember our moments together. then later in my life, i got bullied in school when i was around 9 1 years old for literally no reason i was protecting myself from that assholes but yeah i still got bullied . then later through middle school, i had some problems with my relationship with friends but nothing important still friends with them. then when i was 13 i and my family moved to another country where i didn't know the language i still live there . it was pretty hard to leave everything behind. and that is when things got shitty. so it was the middle of the school semester of 7th grade. shortly i was ripping my ass off to learn the language but bc of it was so hard i was learning slow and basically, i wasn't understanding anything and couldn't speak it is like being deaf and not being able to speak, yeah i was hearing but not understanding . it was so hard to communicate, i was so lonely. every fucking day i was watching everyone laugh at each other and spend time with each other. i was so lonely, lessons were hard and it was whole another culture. it was the worst time of my life. i had no one to talk to. my parents were asking me how i was doing but i kept telling them lies to don't make them sad. so it was like that for about 2 years. then i started high school which was 2 years ago i taught things would get better but no i was wrong. that was when my depression started. even though i was better at speaking the language i was learning, it was still not enough and i was having communication problems which i still do from time to time and still kinda lonely at high school as well. i met with new people last year no in the school but i feel like they don't actually like me that much. they rarely invite me to hang out with them. so yeah also for the last year i am constantly thinking about dying. i am not brave enough to kill myself but i would like to die in an accident or maybe in my sleep it would be so peaceful i think. i think my biggest problem is i can't get over what happened in the past. nothing brings me joy in life. i constantly feel sad and alone sometimes completely numb. that was it i guess. by the way, i am not trying to say that i had the worst life, i would never say that. also english is not my native language so please excuse my mistakes.",0
"desensitized or what?. so all my life i never had many friends. when i did make friends we were close. i had two close friends before moving to a new state. sadly my peak friend count was middle school. i had two best friends coming out of high school 2 friend coincidence? but now it s one and we check in on each other every couple months or weeks and i try to see them but i m almost certain they just feel bad for me and don t actually intend on getting close again. my family is quite toxic amp; i never became close with them either. i m 25 now for context. i believe my parents and sibling are narcissistic. when i had a therapist i did a better help trial they said i m not one because i asked if i was and narcissists wouldn t be as self aware. as for my family, at the very least they have a god complex. they ve always made me feel bad about myself. i usually see the rest of my family every 2 years fir holidays but we re all distant a lot of them don t think the best of me because of my parents. it s hard to give a real insight to my struggles with all the story gaps. anyway i could go into detail about it all but i m already getting carried away. i struggle with rejection paranoia and i m certain i have anxiety and depression. i ve struggled with not making any new meaningful connections for 5 years now. i ve become so impulsive and am in credit debt. i was diagnosed with add when i was young so i think it had a lot to do with their development. if i didn t have my partner idk what my life would ve ended up like today. over the past year we both addressed our addiction to weed. i m gonna try and hold myself accountable to not smoking anymore with hopes of getting a real job this fall. goal is not going back to it for at least 3 days my partner has their own set of mental struggles but i think isn t as bad as i in some ways luckily they ve h grown up with 99 of their friends. i tried blending into their circle but it s gotten hard to ignore their judgment they see me as a spoiled kid i think. i m just there as a rag along and it s hard to ignore their remakes and talking to my partner in the past about it made me feel paranoid and afraid to make matters worse by confrontation. but that just makes breaking points like it has i look to yt for most of my free time or end up sleeping most of the day when i m alone. seeing other ideal relationships makes me hope that someday i this will be in the past. it s gotten worse this summer since i m out of college for the first time in like 7 years . i hide in my room a lot which i hate but i really appreciate it too. his year i made progress in some ways like taking to a few acquaintances in work vs my last job where a bunch of kids used to bully me. i used to cry on and off just thinking about how my life has turned out but now i feel stuck in my ways like it s safe, guarded, cold at times, i lost social skills, and at times i m unbothered by it. i don t have the drive like i used to but. for school i was able to push myself towards the end idk where to start so offering any opinions could be helpful .i made this account to. post this ",0

"i m nothing more than a tool for other peoples happiness.. i go out of my way to make everyone around me happy. i m the happy go lucky friend to everyone. what people don t know is how much i hurt on the inside and i can t figure out how to express it. someone has a bad day and i m the guy people vent to, got in to it with a spouse, i ll lend you a shoulder to cry on. i ve put myself in such a situation that i feel like i m not aloud to be the one that s hurt. i have to be strong so others can survive. my best friend of 25 years was the only one who knew how much i truly hurt on the inside and in the end it was that same person who hurt me the most. another really close friend of mine committed suicide on my birthday a few years ago. i had always been there for him in the past with his suicidal thoughts and talked him out of it many times. the night before my birthday he text me looking for my help again. i was so tired of being the guy trying to help others and i told myself if he hasn t done it yet, he s not going to now. the news was broken to me the next day. i ve had so many people tell me that it s not my fault, but they don t know that pain, they don t know that guilt that i carry every day of my life. telling me it s not my fault doesn t help because that s other peoples opinions. it s not going to change my own. ever since then i ve been nothing more than a stepping stone to everyone i know. i ll mask my pain and do my happy song and dance for you because something mildly inconvenienced you. how am i doing you say? oh i m doing just great i m always here to help.. i m not suicidal in any way shape or form but every day i realize i d rather die than keep living my life as everyones emotional door mat. maybe i ll get my shit together one day, but for now, let me mask every single emotion i have to make your day better.",0

"i realised one of the major reasons i m depressed . and it hit me from a really good friend sending me an old photo. i went back on our see friendship thing on facebook to find photos to send her and i found myself automatically smiling. we met 1 years ago when i was 19 and we were so present in each other s lives up until around the pandemic time. life felt more carefree partially due to age i suppose , we would joke about stupid stuff way more and we had so much time to be present for one another. i was so happy at university compared to now even though i still had some mental health problems . i ve realised more recently that it s because i had a sense of community. i lived with my friends and had a rich, consistent social life with people i grew so close to because we were so present for one another most days . i ve felt so incredibly empty and depressed recently. the more real adult life progressed, the more friends became busy with career, family and partner commitments. i ended up relying on my partner way too much and when i left him 6 months ago, i ve been left with an empty feeling ever since. i m trying to learn to enjoy my own company and it s definitely getting a bit easier and i appreciate myself so much more. but i long so desperately for that sense of community i once had. texting friends about more mundane stuff and then meeting up every 2 4 weeks is so unfulfilling. virtual online connection does hardly anything for me. we are still good friends, but that connected, truly comfortable feeling has faded the kind of feeling you get from true community. we re all too focused on what modern society tells you requires you to be focused on to truly connect. i m almost 3 so it s getting even worse due to people wanting trying for children. community is so important and i really do think it s a huge contributor to why so many people are horribly depressed nowadays. even when i think back to the 9 s 2 s, people seemed more connected even the adults in my life with one another. i feel really fortunate to have grown up for part of my childhood without the kind of intense social media technological landscape we have now. i am so thirsty to be part of something. to have purpose to create to learn and experience something with others. to have real human, normal bonds not whatever this post pandemic weirdness is. it s so unhealthy. community is out there, but i think we have to search harder and fight much more for it. you have to really put yourself out there and join some kind of club, cause or group. the kind of pre set communities like neighbourhoods, churches etc. just don t exist in the same way anymore. we re so damn individualistic and i m tired. the more i sit in my home office working and only having proper contact with my housemates most days, the more i feel my empathy and humanness depleting. no more i m getting myself out there even if it requires joining 5 damn clubs and going bankrupt in the process. community that s what s missing.",0

"depersonalizing derealization from getting too attached to tv show?. does anyone get depersonalization derealization from getting too involved in a tv show or movie? this has happened to me before in the past but this time, i got really obsessed with a drama series sci fi thriller series and got really connected to the characters and plot. so much that i started to wish i existed in that world and started to imagine myself interacting with those characters and involved in those plot lines. it made me really sad because i know it s not real and i obviously can t do that. coming back to my own reality it s like i m missing something that i never had. life doesn t seem as fun and interesting and magical the series itself is pretty dark but it s eventful. it makes me feel like i want to go on a big adventure or be the hero in a story and i can t. it makes me feel trapped in my body and reality, and also makes me start to question reality and who i am. i start to imagine myself in different realities and get more and more dissociative. things in my current world become not enough and i feel empty and lonely for something that isn t real and i never was a part of. i have to take a break from the show for a while to disconnect. but currently just experienced a meltdown crying on my couch and intermittently zoning out for minutes at a time feeling really scared not knowing what s real or who i am. has anyone else had experiences like this? why is this happening? i hate this feeling and just want it to go away. but it s like i can t get my mind off the show and every time i think about it the depersonalization and sadness comes back.

""rob a bank."" yeah, i know. i know. just do something different right? i know. but my mind already knows that it doesn't matter. all of the things i might do differently or improve: it does not matter. i helped others. i lived for others. doesn't help. after a while, they take it for granted. and you become a doormat, a pushover, a friendly guy. i hate my life. i've seen enough. i'm not going to kill myself right away, but am going to do so in a couple of days. i seriously hope that someone out there has the solution. something that gives me hope. but man, i am so completely done of this useless, boring existence.

"my life is not exhausting, but i'm exhausted.. i'm 19f been having a depressive episode for almost a week, and i am so exhausted. i rarely have genuine long conversations with my boyfriend 26m as our relationship tends to be him giving into my needs wants and understanding each other's likes and dislikes. we've formed somewhat of a routine that we are content with. a couple of hours ago we were about to go to bed on facetime, i told him that i didn't feel like attending school. for context, i am about to begin my final year of diploma in mid august, and my bf is beginning his 2nd year. we've had 3 months of break prior to the upcoming semester. anyway... taking a gap year has been on my mind for a few months, but i was and still am afraid to do so before graduating, as i have never had such a long break. it was primary school, straight to secondary school, straight to my current college. he replied that i should persevere a little while more and complete my diploma. of course that's the ideal situation, but i am afraid that i'm already feeling so depressed tired suicidal now, what more when i'm under high stress? nowadays my daily schedule is to wake up at around 1 2pm, sigh, use my phone to order food delivery for lunch, stay in bed until the food comes then have lunch. afterwards i would take a shower, sit at my table and watch youtube until it's 6.3 pm. time to order food for dinner. i watch shows until i finish dinner, shower again, watch more shows and go to bed on facetime with my bf at about 1am. i would then mute myself and go on tiktok while he sleeps, until i'm able to fall asleep at usually about 4am. why is everything so tiring? literally from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep, i'm dreading everything in between and more. i'm worried about the future my upcoming semester, my finances, my relationship, my parents, etc. i told my boyfriend all this earlier and he doesn't seem to understand my point of view. i know he is desparate in trying to be in my shoes, but i'm not sure how to explain it to him. i told him that to me, staying alive is like a bothersome chore that i don't like to do, but it's necessary. his reply to that is ""just think if you die, i'll be all alone in this world."" and that makes me cry my heart out. as i'm writing this post, i've stopped bawling and i think i'm thinking logically. i'm depressed and i have been depressed for a really long time, and honestly it feels like life is not worth living anymore. yes i love my boyfriend with all my heart and i would hate to leave him with all the trauma. but i'm feeling too much pain and emptiness every day, and it makes me feel helpless. should i kill myself? or how do i feel good enough to want to survive?",0

"feeling alone and directionless. title gets it good, used to have friends but i learned recently that they haven't actually liked me for a solid year and its been a fa ade on their part, the general stuff like constantly talking shit behind your back the moment they think you're out of earshot, avoiding me, the whole meme about the second group chat with everyone but me has been my reality for lord knows how long, only time they ever contact me or don't reject my attempts at making plans is when they need something from me, whether its playing it support or chauffeur its the only time they want me around. had a girlfriend but ended up pushing her away by not being the most healthy mentally so i guess i have nobody to blame but myself on that front, she deserves better anyway. i have parents i could talk to in theory but last time they found out how badly i want to die most days they cried and i love my parents so i'm not putting them through that again. i have no idea what to do with my life now that i'm nearly out of highschool, i don't even know what my options in life are, i don't know what i don't know. i thought i had it figured out when i got a job in a field i enjoy but turns out i really hate working in said field and want to quit so fucking desperately but also want to stop being the family disappointment? there's nothing really to support that its just how i feel. i'm honestly sorry for what feels like an insane ramble but i've run out of outlets, maybe some of you have some insane lifechanging wisdom, maybe you'll berate me and call me a fool, either way getting my head out is nice",0

"a question about anger and being mean. so i ve been searching for this for a while and have turned up nothing. is feeling more outright anger a sign of becoming less depressed? like is that a sign of being less numb and sad? anger is a separate emotion from those things, a more extroverted one that makes you speak out and things as well as can make you feel a strange sensation in your throat and stomach similar to butterflies. i don t like being angry because it causes me to be rude towards people and possibly hurt their feelings and i hate that i ve been doing that recently but i m just curious if it s a sign of lifting depression, like is it a good thing or a bad thing? i m working on stopping myself from blurting out things or shooting people dirty looks because it s so mean feeling but i m hopeful it s a possible sign that i m becoming less depressed, i would really like if someone could answer this edit: also sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, i m not sure which sub would be best for this question",0

"how do i help someone i can't understand ?. my brother and a friend of mine are both depressed and i have no idea to how i can help them. i always helped people with their problem, but for me it's impossible to help someone without understanding the problem. so one day as we were eating at a restaurant with some other friend we talked about depression and nihilism and as we were talking i tried to bring in the conversation a female friend who suffer from depression. she evaded the conversation and i've been told to be an idiot for asking directly. but my question is how do you help someone you can't comprehend ? i have observed my brother for a long time without ever coming close to understand how to help him. i don't know if when we talk i am helping him or hurting him. so i figuered to ask directly to someone with the same disorder. is it right risking to hurt someone to help them or should i mind my own bisness and let them andle it by them selves?",0

"angry at life. i am angry at being alive. i have nobody to tell this to. i don't really want to burden my friends or family with the knowledge that i hate existing, because it feels to me like then they will feel the need to take some action to help me feel better, which honestly i don't want and there's really nothing anyone can say to help. i guess i just need to get it off my chest. i wake up every morning at 5:3 . i do my morning chores of taking care of my pets and then i go to work. i deal with assholes all day who treat me less than human for a job that while sometimes can be tolerable, is mainly hot, hard, work that leaves me in crippling pain nightly. i work my most of the time 1 hour day. go home, do my evening chores, again taking care of the pets, make dinner, watch tv, take a shower, go to bed. repeat. on the few days i have off, i clean the house or run errands. i don't find joy in day to day existence and honestly can't find reason for anything. we are meat puppets used by corporations for as long as possible until either we wear out and are physically unable to do the job or we die. if you're one of the ""lucky"" ones and somehow manage to find a way to exist well enough below your income that you can afford to save money, you might get to retire one day. the good news is though, while you're working, your glorious corporation gives you two whole weeks that you can do whatever you choose. so basically, you give up 4 hours of your waking time every week and you get two fucking weeks out of the whole god damn year of your life to use as you see fit. and around we go again until we die. the worst part is knowing this and knowing that there's literally no way out of it. even if you win the lottery or create a start up, you still live within the framework that dictates that you have to earn money by using your time and body in exchange to continue exist. there is no escape from it. i guess i could learn some survival skills, get rid of all of my unnecessary possessions, and disappear into the forest, but even still, at some point i may need medical attention or something else that requires i have some form of financial means. i feel so trapped and for what? what exactly do i get out of being alive? there's no punchline. i feel like i'm constantly waiting for some sort of reason to come to me so i can have that ""aha"" moment and finally understand how people continue to exist every day.",0
"just a dump of everything that s been happening lately because it felt nice to type it out instead of keeping it in my head. feels like i m constantly about to burst. i stay up all night praying for an end know damn well i don t don t believe in a god. i lie to everyone including myself about everything because my trust issues are fucking abominable. i terrified of any kind of rejection even thinking about getting told no to a simple question is enough to make me have a panic attack. i sometimes go entire days with talking to even myself because i feel what i have to say isn t important in the slightest. i m about 3 months clean from self harm but at least once a week i ll hold a razor blade to my arm while begging myself to do it and not do it at the same time. i genuinely believe everyone around me hates me and is annoyed by my mere presence. i ve cried myself to sleep almost every night for about 3 or 4 months now. i don t have any kind of escape or anyone to talk to. i don t enjoy anything anymore. the second i try to do anything positive or better myself i tell myself that i don t deserve it, that i should know my place because who do i think i am? . sometimes when my life seems like it s actually going well, i fuck it up on purpose because being sad is easier. i deny that i m trans despite not being able to go outside somedays as even seeing a girl makes me want to kill my self because oh how i wish i were born a girl. every that i think i d feel comfortable enough to open up to always leaves with no warning. i hate myself for being so pitiful and not even attempting to do anything to fix my life. i feel like a leech i never work for anything and i constantly bring down those around me. i hate that i get overly attached to anyone that even slightly treats me like a person because it hurts so much more when they re leave, yet i keep doing it. i was gonna kill my self back in may but i ended up not being able to take that last step off the 11th story so i ve just been empty and lost since then. i sometimes put a gun to my head when it all gets to be a little too much because for some reason it feels like the only thing in my life i have control over.",0
"what are some of the reasons why i shouldn t end my life?. hi, i m a 19 years old guy and i ve always struggled with depression. ever since i was 3 i d had countless nights of waking up in nightmares, plus my parents fighting didn t really make things better. in elementary school i was thrown into this program at school called iep individualized independent education because it took me a little longer than others to communicate properly. the years i spent in this program was hell, i d constantly be picked on and treated like an animal from different classes, was told im in the slow class . so i ve always felt lonely, fast forward to freshman year of high school and i was able to get out of the program. it honestly wasn t that hard making friends after but it s always been hard dating people. people would often tell me i m cute but leave me for the better guy every time. in junior year in high school i was able to meet this girl from instagram. we started talking but it turns out she was toxic and mentally abused me. last year on valentine s day i tried committing suicide from all the loneliness i was feeling . i took around 5 pills total but there was a variety of them. i sat and waited for about 2 mins and finally i was able to feel the affects. i sat on the ground against my mattress, i noticed i couldn t move my body, my body had been mostly paralyzed. i entered the thoughts of i m really going to die i kinda don t want to die all of these thoughts started passing through my head and i panicked out of it and was able to call my parents with the little strength i had . they picked up and rushed back home from visiting another city. i was took to the hospital and had an iv until the following morning. i still struggle with being lonely. i never had any sexual experiences the most i got from a girl was a hug. i often think maybe i should just kill myself so everyone can eventually forget about me but i m scared. i don t really want to die i just don t want to feel this lonely and miserable.i can t really talk to anyone about these problems either because like every time they ll say you have nothing to worry about don t rush it or sex is overrated but the only reason they can say that is because they ve already experienced it. i don t really have anyone to talk to in general. lately i ve been trying to do more for myself though, i recently got my drivers license and started working out. if anyone reads this, i d appreciate it if you can give me solutions, answers. thankyou",0

"i feel like i am falling back and i cannot get a grip on myself.. my excuses beforehand as this may be a long post. hi, i'm a guy and i'm 23 years old. my life has been a constant battle with myself and the world around me. at a very young age, i have been diagnosed with autism. in general, me and the people around me feel like it doesn't really affect me, which i came to doubt. i also have been bullied for most of my life. one of my only friends in person was my nephew living across the street. even him i now barely see as we grew apart once adult life started and schedules stopped aligning. from the age of 1 , i been diagnosed and struggling with depression. i tried to get through it, but on my 14th i broke and tried to do something stupid, but i couldn't. in that time i was on a high school specifically for autistic people, and via there i got into a mental hospital for treatment. after that one, i went to a second. i been away from home for nearly 2 years for that, and it didnt help. eventually i learned to help myself, and once i finished high school and started college at thw age of 17, i felt better. college was decent, and even though i struggled through those years and had an amazing persom there to guide me, i still felt lost. i ended up working in the restaurant business, something i somewhat enjoyed. then covid hit. i lost my job, i lost my passion, i lost my girlfriend of 3 years which ended up being good for me, as it was not a good relationship . for the past 2 years, i have been lost. i tried dating, but always felt alone or lost. i couldnt get a proper job and even though i made some online friends in the progress, still i feel alone. i discovered i have aphantasia and a whole array of mental and physical issues. now to my current situation, as im sitting here overthinking life. the more i type this message, the heavier i feel. my hands feel like bricks hammering at my phone. i feel like i am lost again. i feel like i am scared again. i feel alone and afraid and i do not know what to do. i have a job i enjoy, but due to the current economics it kind of got very silent temporarily. i stand up, go to work, come back, all i want to do is sleep. i pull myself out of bed to eat and force myself to keep doing stuff. i have hobbies i do, as i play dnd on 3 week days. but where i enjoyed this in the beginning, i cannot concentrate on it anymore. i have some online friends and people i am very close with, but it feels like its one sided, wether its true or not. i feel alone and i feel like i bother everyone. i frequently overthink and overreact, and freak out. i started getting ptsd flashbacks of terrible things and i just shut down. im already searching for a psychologist, but the waiting lists are extremely long. i don't know what more to say. i have trouble feeling and thinking. i only keep going because work is counting on me to show up. everything outside of works feels like a lot of effort to me, and dare i say, i would be better off alone and not having any obligations to do or see or talk to anyone. but i know i couldnt, and shouldnt. currently, there is one specisl person in my life. she makes me happy still, whenever she texts me i get happy. creepy or not, i sometimes look at her photo's because her face and her eyes and her smile makes me smile. but those are the only moments i feel like i enjoy. in fact, those are one of the few rare moments in my life i actually feel emotions. normally emotions have been a state of mind, a though. i just 'know' i feel something rather then feeling it i may be a sociopath . but im afraid to scare her away or lose her, and im scared to get hurt. most people in my life have hurt me and i know she is different, but my minds tells me to be scared. i don't know what to do, where to go, or what i need. i get through life now by spending money on stupid shit i dont even need or use. it doesnt even make me happy when i buy stuff. i just dont want to have money, and i cant be happy, so i prefer making others happy with it. i have no idea where im going with this post, just a look inside my mind. i hope there is someone out there who has felt kr been through something similar, and can offer tips or guidance. anything if welcome at this point, as i lost the light and im now lost in a dark room.",0
"28, at my wits end. this is my first time ever posting in a reddit forum, and to be honest it makes me really uneasy spilling my darkness even if i m anonymous. as i write this i lay here in bed, end of summer at 2pm. i no longer see the reason in getting up, as at every single corner and every single thing i do or try ends in disappointment. i hope someone can relate, please. when i was in my pre early teens i suffered from severe panic attacks, until i reached about 2 to which it turned into to full blown depersonalization disorder. i was so gone mentally and physically, totally agoraphobic. i was suicidal, not necessarily because of the depression but because i d simply lost the person i once was. my thoughts, and my appearance total stranger. once i started going to the bars and being social again it started to subside. i had some decent times but ultimately i ve been slapped in the face the reality that i never lived my young life, i was never happy. ive been so unlucky with everything that it s a running joke with my friends. i ve never had a girlfriend. never went to college. i m reaching 3 and i just so badly want to turn around and live that life. my inner demons have prevented me from all of that. my problem is now, because nothing has worked out, i ve grown so incredibly apathetic. i m bitter. my therapist essentially gave up on me. he couldn t figure out how to fix me so he was like idk maybe try acupuncture or something? wtf. i m just done.",0
"i can t tell the difference between paranoid psychosis and my ego. im chronically suicidal and have been coping by dissociating for years. i have to forget what i am if i ever want a chance of getting out of bed. i ve been pretty successful in locking myself out of my ego, but this recent week ive felt moments of myself slipping back into terror. i m so confused at what s happening. i know this fear is because of my history of repressed suffering and dissociation, but i can t tell whether this confusion and fear is setting in psychosis or healing mindfulness. i hold no remorse or compassion for myself, neuroticism is all i ever know in relation to my being. even if i rationalize my psychology i ll never give myself the benefit of the doubt. im always irrationally at fault. and everytime i look in the mirror i slip further and further into this confusion and fear. what thw fuck is going on",0
wanting to ruin everything in my life. i've realized my go to move when i hit a strong depressive spiral my first response is to delete all the games on my phone and i want to destroy every good thing in my life. like everything that gives me any modicum of joy i want it gone including any friendships or relationships i have at the time. i'm sure a lot of other people feel this but would it be considered a form of self harm? i've always thought i haven't done any self harm because i haven't physically done anything but would these kinds of actions still count?,0

"i listened to a song and almost killed myself. ive had struggles with depression for a few years now and went about 4 months without being like that. but about 3 hours ago i listened to a song called memoir 2. i don't know what about the song made me feel so depressed and empty. maybe i thought about how fucked up the world is right now. maybe i thought about my uncle. maybe i realized that we cant turn back from how far we have fucked up over the years. i was 3 seconds away from stabbing myself. and yet now 3 hours later i feel fine. just scared. ive put the barrel to my face before. but this was different. ive hit rock bottom before. but this felt different. i was scared because i wasn't even thinking. i was about to do it. i don't know what's wrong with me. i feel fine now after a few hours of meditation i dont know if i want to post this. i don't want my family seeing this. because i feel fine now. i don't feel like i need help. needless to say ill never listen to this damn song again. i need to know, am i the only one who did this. listen to a song and do this. i need to know. i want to sleep tonight. i don't want to think about this. im 13. i shouldn't have to worry about fucking killing myself over listening to a song. am i the only one?",0
"attack on titan has basically kept me alive. i was planning on killing myself in early 2 21 but decided i'd stick it out until the end of attack on titan since its final season was airing and i was super invested in it. suddenly it reveals that it was only part 1 and part 2 comes out in 2 22. i was pissed but also marginally better mentally. enough that i thought, fuck it, let's stick it out another year because i need to see this. suddenly it was weirdly easier. instead of seeing the weight of my future and the unbearable thought of fighting through another 7 or 8 years in this hell, i saw only the year in front of me. 2 22 came around and by that point i was in a decent enough place to think, i want to go out with a bang. i decided to have one last push through 2 22 and start kicking things off my bucket list. of course, i was expecting to end it at the end of the year but attack on titan then baited me with a part 3 to the final season so now it looks like i'm pushing through the first few months of 2 23. but it's not like i'm not doing better. i'm working 13 hours a week which doesn't sound like much but its all my mental health can handle right now. i wanted to run tough mudder, a marathon and a triathlon all in one year. i had a burst of motivation, worked out heavily for about four months, did tough mudder,and then fell back into another depressive episode. i think i'm coming it out of it now, a little too late because i have a marathon coming up with only a month to train for it and i've just been laying around for two months. the triathlon isn't happening but 2 out of 3 isn't bad. i still want to die in the next few years but i'm at least at a place of somewhat handling my issues.",0

"feeling emotionally burned out and don't know what to do with myself?. preface its long but thanks for reading : these past few months i've been feeling pretty drained emotionally and mentally. i've felt depressed for a long time now but it's really hitting hard now. my childhood pet that i loved like my firstborn child and the only one who understood me really passed away and someone i was really close to at work passed away recently. i'm still at home with my parents and siblings working so i can't really afford to talk to a counselor or move out yet and i don't really trust anyone in my family to talk about my problems either. my mom would just tell me she has problems too and turn the conversation into being about her venting or saying she's too busy to deal with my issues. my dad works all day and comes home late at night so when i do talk to him i have to do it in a hurry and sometimes i say forget it because i know he's stressed enough and i don't want to add to it. my younger sis is like my mom in some ways, she will listen to me but then when i start talking about my depression the answer is to pray it away and then she talks about her own problems bc she's looking for advice. my bro is in his own world and won't even say hello or ask me how i'm doing when he sees me. and my other bro, who i haven't really spent any time with since elementary school, will only really greet me and talk to my parents and other siblings when he comes around for visits. we have a estranged relationship that i've given up on building a long time ago so i don't think i'll ever feel comfortable sharing anything with him. if i talk to another family member, especially about my mom or family issues, they'll take what i said and spread it as gossip or go back and tell my parents. when i tried telling my pcp about my issues with my mom in the room , she could only watch in horror as i admitted that i was feeling overly stressed and depressed something i never admitted to a doctor before but i've dealt with almost my whole life and then explained to the doctor for me that i'm only feeling that way because i lost my pet and my co worker this year and wouldn't let me elaborate any further because she didn't want the doctor to ""put me on any medication"". my bff spends most of her time now hanging out with her girlfriend's friends and partying. i always had to initiate calls or hangouts which didn't even feel like quality time together because she was always messaging someone else or not really listening to anything i say. i'm a infj so that really hurts to deal with since i'm always there when she needs me for anything and willing to give emotional support too. out of everyone in my social circle, she was the only one i could rely on but i didn't do it often because i didn't want to be dependent on her. i used to talk about my problems with her but with her being busy with other people, i haven't really had anyone to vent to or express how i feel which is hard enough already . i've felt this way before a few years ago and when i told her i wanted to spend quality time with just her and no one else, i thought she understood what i meant since we haven't had this issue since recently. i was already feeling pretty depressed but when i saw how low of a priority i was on her list to even care about what i have to say, i completely shut down and haven't said anything to her or any of my other not as close friends for over a month because of how hurt i felt. she asked me if i wanted to celebrate my birthday last month and because of how stressed i am with work, school, and other business i told her that while i appreciated the thought, i didn't want to celebrate this year. i just didn't feel like hanging out while i still felt like this and had these kind of thoughts because i know i'd cover it up the best i could and be ""happy"" so the mood won't be sour. plus, the death of my pet has really been hard for me to get over and this was the first birthday i experienced without her so it's not really a happy time for me right now. tl;dr: i guess you can say i just got tired of feeling like i have to explain how i feel to them when they ask what's wrong with me or if they did something because what's the point if no one is even going to listen or try to help me. or they hear me out and then get defensive when i say they are a part of the problem. i'm always expected to be there for everyone no matter the situation or how i'm feeling and yet when i need help, i don't really have anyone to turn to which really isn't helping my depression so i've completely shutdown on everyone. so i guess i just wanted to ask if there was anything i should do? i do plan on paying to see a therapist in the next few months when i start working again but ig i just wanted to know if it was okay to feel burned out after all of this.",0
i dont want to die but i really dont want to live either.. i dont want to die but i really dont want to live either. there is not a single moment or day where i didnt wish i could just stop existing or that i was never born or or that i was dead so i guess i do want to die. i dont even know . but i know i am too much of a coward to actually attempt it amp; every time i come close i get too scared or just tell myself it will get better. but really when will it? its been 7 years and only getting worse. i just wish i could sleep and not wake up again. i really dont want to do anything with my life either. every thing is exhausting and boring. all i want to do is sleep. i really dont do anything. i just sit around or sleep all day. been like this for 7 years now. . getting out of bed is already really hard nevermind actually being productive. and i really need a job too but that is giving me huge anxiety. i know i need to suck it up and grow up but its hard to do anything. i honestly just wish i was never born. sorry for posting.,0
"eh.. hey reddit. this is my last resort to just talking about anything. it s been a long week. for clarification i have been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and ptsd. the past 6 years, and have been struggling for almost 12. i am in therapy every wednesday. i have become nothing but an empty husk. i ve began to take 3 4x more of my antidepressants just to barely keep my head above the water. 9 12 mg , 3 mg is my dosage. it does ok. i have already tried 7 times with my psychiatrist to help me but he doesn t seem worried about anything i tell him and dismisses me with no change to my treatment. i have no friends. i have tried talking to people who i think are my friends but then i m told i m a p ssy for going to therapy. i have had probably the toughest week of the year. my girlfriend broke up with me then i had my car repossessed yesterday morning which takes my last ounce of any freedom i had before. my family doesn t seem to care about anything i go through. my parents co signed on my car knowing full well i couldn t just buy a car from a dealer alone, which of course resorted to repossession. i am now actively looking for a loan to maybe just pay the car off and make payments to the bank on the loan? i don t know shit about anything. no one has ever helped me learn how to be a functioning adult, almost 22 and i feel like i m a joke. i don t know what to do or how to do anything. i have already had my father get in my face and yell at me about how do i have ptsd if i have never been to war or had a gun shot at me, i am constantly degraded and mistreated. i cannot move out because of my credit being shit and of course with how this stupid ass country is doing i can t afford to do anything. let alone if i stay in this town any longer i might just die. i ve just been sitting here, doing nothing, all by myself. no support, no friends. my only friends i feel like i do have are my bearded dragons. but obviously they don t know what i am talking about but i guess it makes me feel better i can at least talk to another living thing without being told i am wrong or should just take my own life. i have 2 friends from way back when i was in middle school but they don t ever seem like they care enough. they just resume their conversations without me while i just sit here and get consumed by extremely depressive thoughts. my now ex and i broke it off mutually. we knew we were mentally not doing so good and that we would still talk to and support each other because down the line it s possible we could try again because we don t hate each other and are still very open about wanting to be there for each other even if there is no label in the way. but i feel embarrassed to try and talk to her because obviously this isn t only about me and i want to help her too. i ve become super isolated, i don t want to eat, drink, or see anyone. so i just lay in my bed staring at the wall for hours until i pass out again. i have noticed i cannot cry or anything anymore and haven t been able to for some time. i feel nothing. i have already been admitted into an psychward and do not wish to be there again. hate it there.",0

"i am 25, feeling empty and lonely. i would like to end up my life sometimes, but i don't have the courage. what would you do if you were me? besides asking for professional help. i have been living abroad for four years, with a major focus on developing my career. now i am 25, and i have realized that my life is empty: a lot of my old friendships are getting colder and more distant; i am a different person now and i feel that i don't have that much in common with my old friends as well as with most of my family members anymore. my life is like a race against the clock, i don't enjoy my days anymore: it's just working. i am a freelance model, therefore i've been traveling for work constantly this year, without a real break. whenever i wanted to take part in social events, i couldn't because i had to work or recover from physical and mental tiredness. i'm going to start a new life in milan next month: i'm going to attend one of the best universities in town, living on my own completely in a nice one bedroom apartment in the historical center, but i don't feel excited anymore. i am not excited about going out anymore, i don't like eating anymore, i can't find anything interesting in many people anymore...everything is disconnected and irrelevant to me. i am going on holiday to one of the most beautiful and posh places in tuscany this month, but i still feel stressed out about my job and life. the only constant company that i've had this year has been myself and the photographers and models with whom i have been working lately...that's all. i am in the middle of my 2 s now and wondering if i will ever make any new real friends in the future. because i have been an expat living abroad for several years, i met just superficial people both as friends and in love as well. today i have just realized that my whole life is just a spare room with nothing inside but cold. the more i get the more i want to achieve, sometimes i just want to end up my life, and, consequently, end my pain and worries. if the world is just a cold and highly competitive place to live with too many mean people, i don't know if i will ever survive.",0

"wrote a suicide note last night. the last few days have been incredibly hard for me, having extreme anxiety attacks, unable to get up in the morning and feeling the most depressed since i can remember. suicide had never been on the table for me but i just so tired of my anxiety, like when it's to the point i'm scared to answer the door phone or go somewhere new like how do i have any chance in life. i'm honestly just too weak to effectively deal with the struggles of life. so i spent last night, listening to my favourite songs typing out a suicide note in my notes page on my phone. it was oddly freeing to be able to just write my feelings down, thanking each of my family members for being amazing and being incredibly loving. expressing my reasons and the issues i had been hiding from them and asking for forgiveness for being so selfish. letting them know it was no one's fault but mine and i hope they can understand to some degree. don't think i have cried in the last 3 years but i was effectively sobbing as i wrote, thinking about how my family would react to hearing that i had killed myself. it did make me feel like i should try a little longer for them, but will see how the next few days go. as it's just going to get worse. i think i'll keep adding to the note as it was good writing that stuff down for me, like a small outlet of sorts. but yh don't worry about me, i'll be fine. i just wanted to have another outlet i guess and i recommend writing a note of sorts if you are ever struggling as i found it helpful to think about my life, the effect it will have on others, and just thanking the people in my life",0
"it s not getting any better. when i told family i thought i was becoming depressed a few years ago, everyone just patted me on the back, and told me i ll get through it and to hang in there. so i stayed quiet about it for a while. i didn t want to bother anyone, or stress them out. recently though it s become so overwhelming i can barely do anything. random thoughts of getting fired from my job, losing my house, losing my family, have invaded my mind and won t leave. i spend most of days crying, even while i m at work. i can t stop having negative thoughts. i ve tried therapy, i ve tried medication. nothing really seems to work. i m at the point now where i m wondering if i should just kill myself. honestly i just don t have any interest in living while i feel like this everyday. and i don t see things changing, they only seem to get worse. i ve quickly reached the end of my rope. i don t want to tell my family this because they ll do nothing but worry. i have no friends to talk to over the last couple years i ve cut everyone of them off and i don t know why. so i m coming here. thanks for listening reddit.",0

"i wish there was a way to truly forget bad memories.. the first few months of my year have been a fucking write off. even though it's been on an upward slope since may, i still keep thinking about a very bad period in my life and it stops me truly enjoying things even now. i can't wait till this year is over and i just want to forget everything that happened before summer. and i'm sick of this shit, people telling me my bad memories are important and i can learn from them. fuck that. i want to forget. all of it. i watched eternal sunshine the other day and i wasn't a big fan of the film but i love the idea of it, just being to erase memories completely. and what i felt during the start of the year bled into everything songs i listened to, places i'd go, and things that were special to me, how just been tainted and i can't fucking enjoy them now. does anyone else ever get that feeling? this year i've felt tiny, insignificant, scared and pissed off and angry all at the same time. i just want to say that if there is a god, i'd tell him i'm not impressed at all.",0

"my first year at uni has ruined me. i m not really quite sure where to start. i m 21, female and from england. i moved to a different city 4 hours away from my hometown to study last september. i m quite outgoing, confident and self assured and would say that i was already quite mature and content before i left uni. i was happy within myself and was so hopeful and optimistic that my university experience would be full of opportunity and newness. i m very close to my single mother and moving away was extremely hard. it was great in the beginning when i was navigating through my new city, filled with new people and it was, to me, a honeymoon stage because it didn t last for too long. i was eating well everyday, looking after myself physically but now the years over, i am mentally burnt out. i didn t have the greatest time with friends even though i m incredibly social. i didn t realise the majority of people just wanted to drink and do drugs and go clubbing most of the time. i didn t find my people, and instead found people that loved to put me down despite how unproblematic i am. i lived with 7 other girls in uni halls and it was the worst. what helped me was my incredible lecturers, the support i had from them helped me so much. i spent my whole year, everyday picking myself up if i felt sad or anxious. my fomo didn t help either, i ve been waiting to go to university for a very long time and the build up of expectations also led to my demise. my mum would come and stay with me for a week at a time every other month when she realised i wasn t okay. somehow i managed to pass all of my exams and my year, which i didn t think i could do with how low i felt and how constantly ill i was getting, probs due to stress. my whole year i was surrounded by toxic, and negative people who mostly dropped out towards the end anyway because they were so unserious. my coursemates are all toxic and treat the degree like it s a competition. i ve come back home for summer feeling broken, feeling like i m not who i was anymore. i feel numb, and i feel empty i feel like nothing excites me anymore and i feel burnt out. i think my stress levels were so high this past year that my body physically can t handle it because for the first time in my life, my face has broken out in painful eczema that won t go away. which doesn t help how i m feeling because now im back home, i just want to go out and about and distract myself from my year. i want to share a lot but i don t want this post to be too long but i do feel like, my year moving out to uni traumatised me. i had covid for a month in january and had never felt so alone and by myself. trying to manage food and looking after myself was so difficult that i ended up becoming so ill, paramedics had to take me to the hospital. i had no one around me that truly cared, and it was the most isolating experience i ve ever had. there s a feeling i can t shake from spending my year alone trying to navigate my world, and then the feeling of living on campus which made me feel suffocated. the food shops every week, the workload of my course, the urge to experience life in this new city and do everything i could to do it etc etc. i think my year would ve been the complete opposite if i didn t live in halls, or if i had a good, consistent group of people around me. i don t drink or smoke, and i m not the type of person whose interested in short term relationships or flings, at heart i do feel a lot older and just crave peace. i know next year all i want to do is study, go gym and eat and sleep well and have a part time job. i really want to use these few years at uni to build a life for myself, i just don t know where i went wrong, because whose to blame other than me. despite that, on the upside i have a nice house next year which isn t uni accommodation with two lovely girls, one who i ve known all year. so i can t complain about that, and my new neighbourhood is incredible. it won t have that suffocating, uni student feel. it s nice to be around families and kids, or older people. i just want to heal from my past experience so i can enjoy my new chapter and hopefully a better year. i guess i just want some advice to heal and cope now, and to help my body mentally and physically heal. i went into uni happy, and bubbly, no self esteem issues and incredible confidence and good health. but this whole time, it s been slowly chipping away and i m not kind to myself one bit. i don t feel like me, and i don t know how to go about feeling like there s a light at the end of the tunnel. even though i passed my year and i m proud of myself, i don t even feel any sort of way about it. i know all of how i m feeling is perspective and mindset, i just don t know what i need. i do have the desire to change and work on myself to get better, if anyone has anything i could learn from to help me, i really will listen i m desperate. i have big goals after uni. to become an optometrist, and buy a home for me and my mum. i spent a few years working super hard to have saved a small deposit on a place for us both. i have a lot going for me and i m grateful for all of my opportunities, but most of the time i just feel like i m wasted potential but don t know how to go about it. i constantly beat myself up and pick on myself. i sometimes wonder how i will ever be good enough for the world around me. please help me i just need a nudge. thank you for reading and forgive me if i said anything i shouldn t have. my intentions are pure",0
"people telling me i'm addicted to antidepressants. i've been on antidepressants for 9 or so years now and after this recent study on depression i have dozens of people telling me i should quit. i tried to do that years ago and when i tell people that the last time i tried my depression worsened, they tell me it's because i'm addicted. this does confuse me a bit because i've been addicted to pot in the past and the withdrawals from that are nothing like what happened when i stopped taking antidepressants. the medication also doesn't cause a state of 'euphoria' like easily addictive drugs do. it's rather upsetting to see so many people use this study to say that depression isn't real and ""you just need to eat better and exercise more."" these people probably haven't ever seen what depression looks like and are just following what these 'alpha males' are saying. depression runs in the family on my mom's side and she's still medicated she's also in the medical field , so i think mine is genetic rather than being cause by a tragedy. i just don't know how to feel about it because there's no changing their minds, i've tried. it makes me wonder if my depression is even valid.",0
i quit smoking weed the day i came closest to offing myself.. i had been working in my father's company for over 8 months and i can tell you those were like hell he made sure i was always wrong i was always slacking even though i never got a day off never told him no and it got really hard someone you are trying to earn his respect putting you down like that while you are at your lowest so oneday he was out of the house and i just had a thought...go look at his gun my mind said and i probably shouldnt have done that but it was like hypnosis i just started walking and looking at the gun i was sad that it was in the cover and my mind spoke again remove it hold it then i saw his bag of weed and i took a joint from the bag and smoked it on the street then it hit me that i just ran from the pain by smoking and i kept crying alone and vowed never to smoke again and fight the pain head on and didnt smoke since but still depressed i dont know what to do to make it any better but i chose to live and will continue to do so no conclusion but i felt i had to share this.,0
"life's a gamble unnecessary life, a rant . 32, no job, never cared for a career, and frankly irritated that i was ever brought into existence. i was just looking up suicide by hanging. i fantasize of putting an end to it all more often than not. but i always overthink the pain, and worry whether i would fail and wind up with more day to day pain. i hate working, i have no desire to fit into society i feel the pressures of it though , i see no point in life and struggle to create one for myself. anti social, social anxiety, anhedonic depression, avoidant personality, misanthropic views... these are the main things that seem to make me me. i view people as the bane of my existence. most of my problems are traced back to artificial creation capitalism the system, the double edged sword of technology etc. , and the simple fact that humans have the capacity to think about the unnecessary pointlessness of life and the inherent struggles and mortality that comes with it... and yet still choose to procreate. no imaginary unborn human is screaming from the void rhat they want this... it's the selfish and perhaps myopic decision of already born people. generic and succinct post summing up a few of the problems. there is no point to life, but that is not what makes me wish i could end it it's life itself; as soon as you are born you are instantly a thing that requires vital needs and you need to find ways to obtain those survival needs , a thing that will experience pain and suffering guaranteed and no promise of pleasure worth living for ; and you may or may not be okay with it. i'm not okay with it. and i am stuck in it. life's a gamble.",0
"girl i m talking too is pushing me away due to depression and anxiety. hi all, just after some advice. basically i m22 been talking to this girl f21 for 4 months and everything has been going great, she has depression and anxiety and recently has been put on some tablets to help with that but she keeps forgetting to take them which will probably not be helping her head. she has been getting down about not having friends and suddenly she has made some and is out with them most nights meaning i am barely seeing her now and she has been texting me less. i ve asked her about it and if everything is fine and she says yeah but she just needs to focus on herself atm as she is struggling. she knows i am here for her if she needs me but i just don t know what to do as i m barely seeing her atm and she won t open up about her feelings at all which is starting to give me anxiety as i don t know what s happening between us. any advice would be great as it s really starting to mess with my head.",0

not asking for help again. two weeks ago i was at the end of a five day alcohol binge and was considering sticking a knife in my neck was literally holding and checking the sharpness with my thumb . i ve been staying with my dad since then and i m feeling better but i m being suffocated by his attempts to help me. now i feel like i need to make him feel like he s doing a good job. he threatened to call an ambulance for me because i just didn t feel like going for a walk. i had to explain what apathy was and that i m not feeling so bad anymore. now nurses visit me and someone from some charity i can t even remember is coming to see me because my dads fianc organised it. if i tell them i don t want anymore help they get offended. i would rather be in hospital but my country literally has no free space. next time i m gonna go it alone because i don t actually want help. they don t understand and it doesn t help.,0

"feel like i don t deserve anything. my car was 1 years old with 2 k miles on it and was a ford edge. i had wanted it to last me til kids graduate college in 1.5 years bc i just worry what if all the time and never buy myself anything. my car was randomly stalling in the middle of the road while driving and ford couldn t find the issue bc the car would stay on but i had to restart it and it cleared the code. it was also shifting rough, etc. so, i figured it s time for a diff car. it s a bad time to buy, i know , i just didn t feel safe pulling out etc. so i got an almost new subaru crosstrek, a modest car that will again last me a long time . my husband was like get u a car, u never buy shit. it s not the money, its in my budget and no bills except i subsidize my kids college rent 7 a month combined 35 each with roommates . i got their tuition paid from working compulsively for 3 years. i got an extra job while they were in community college which was free in my state so they can have no debt for the last 2 years. that s my lifetime gift to them and they are appreciative and work hard and pay the rest of their b bills. so my point is, i feel like a don t deserve a nicer car and i ve never bought one this new . i just feel like omg what if something bad happens and now i have a car payment i plan to pay off early . i still have savings too. it s just an irrational thing that thinks i don t deserve it or call myself selfish in my head for getting myself something. i know a car isn t a good purchase but i did need one but got one nicer than i needed. anytime anything good has ever happened for me i feel this way whether it s promotion etc. is this depression, ocd, anxiety, imposter syndrome? wtf i m sorry it s so long but as you see i m totally neurotic and feel the need to explain or justify.",0
"my life is a living hell. i am in an extreme level of mental, emotional, and spiritual pain and agony at all times, and have been nearly non stop for the last 15 years. i have bipolar type i disorder and the depressive episodes, which last over a year, are un endurable. i am incapable of killing myself, because first of all, i am too scared, and second, it would only cause more complications more negative karma, family grief, etc. from all that i have read. every few years the symptoms improve and then i sometimes go into a manic state, but eventually i fall right back to the deep, black depressions every time. i have done a ridiculous amount of work on myself but i always end up right back where i started. it's insane. i have tried every conceivable remedy over the years and nothing has worked. medications don't work, therapy doesn't work, and even psychedelics don't work. i have sought out every type of healing method around the world, and nothing has helped. i am not kidding when i say that i have tried it all. i have scoured the internet over the years searching every possible thing i could do and nothing has changed. all it has done is reinforced the idea that there is something horribly wrong with me, or my soul. year after year, the pain continues. i keep sinking lower and lower into hell. lots of people around me get better, but i don't, and i don't know why. one of the worst aspects of this is that i am unable to connect to other people. i am so far disconnected from others that social interactions are painful and almost unbearable. my reality and state of consciousness is always flooded with this psychic and emotional pain that i am unable to experience love. there is no thought, memory or imagination that can change this state. it's pure pain, all the time, every day. statistically speaking, it is unlikely to ever get better for me, unless there will be some miraculous treatment that comes out of science which is highly unlikely, given that society is in a state of collapse and mental health is the last priority in this capitalistic world. my every day reality is one of extreme, 1 out of 1 suffering on a daily basis. i have exhausted every heroic attempt to get better and i am at the point where all i have is patient endurance. that's it. there's nothing more than endurance at this point. so then, what is the point of life? this game is certainly not worth the candle, but i am not allowed to quit, so what other conclusion can i draw but that it is a punishment? so i endure this thing, day after day, as the world goes by. i have ready many nde reports, and all i can hope is that this thing ends soon for me. from the perspective of me to my soul, all i can say is that this learning experiment is highly unethical. it has caused a level of suffering for me that i could not ever imagine was possible on a human level. i hope and pray to god that it ends soon. i have learned a tremendous amount on the spiritual level, mostly from reading. from the buddhist perspective there is of course equanimity, but when all you have is nothing but extreme levels of pain and suffering, the idea of equanimity becomes a joke. for me, and i am sure for many others, this place is a living hell. i have done my absolute best to get better and nothing has worked. what other conclusions can i draw from my life? when my time eventually comes, i can only wonder whether in the spirit world i will laugh or i will cry. i understand that it is a learning experience to know contrast and bla blah blah, but from the perspective of this lifetime, it is a torture chamber, and nothing more. i know that i am not the only one. i am sorry that we are at a point in this human experience where we only have very limited remedies for this kind of thing. i hope and pray for you that your next lifetime, wherever it may be, contains less suffering. i hope to never come back to this place. the highs are certainly not worth the lows. not even close. my plan is to endure this thing, breath by breath, until i die of natural causes. i cannot overemphasize how much this reality hurts. this is a living nightmare. why, just why?",0
"am i wrong?. ive have a mild depression and rn struggling from quite bad anxiety. my mother says that depression is a luxury because the poor just push the depression on the side to work for food. she laughs at me when i try to vent and tells me to deal with it or go suicide as a joke oh it s funny, you re sensitive . other jokes such as: wow you look depressed haha my child s depressed you re depressed again? go die you re so hard to deal with, i m tired and this is what you do to me you should be glad that etc etc. she tells me to just push it away and distract myself, that everything is psychological ofc that s the truth, but she s telling me as if i can snap out of it and essentially i m focusing on myself too much whilst others just deal with it and don t baby about it. she taught me how to hide my feelings, called me a spoiled brat, etc. i think i am spoiled though we are middle class and i do think i get love in some way from her, but i feel guilty for feeling this way and i feel like a whiner. she told me i could always talk to her whenever i need to, and she ll help me but now she s literally taking my shit as stand up comedy. she has different personalities, sometimes it s irritated and mocking, sometimes it s caring and considerate and i get so confused as to which one i m venting to. it s a game of chance. sometimes i feel alone, sometimes i don t, sometimes i feel supported, sometimes i don t. i m in a mental mess rn and all she says is to deal with it, i m so lucky that i can focus on myself like that, it s luxury, i m selfish, selfish fuckhead, etc. i feel so wrong. how do i deal with it ??? i m very lost. my mental illness screwed up the perception of myself and others and my mother s words just fucked me up, i lost my personality and self esteem. am i whiny? am i wrong? am i selfish? is depression a luxury? is anxiety just a snap out of it thing? i don t know anymore i fear that my mother is right all along and i ve been abusing everything for my own self narcissist sake..",0

"corporate excuse for taking a break due to depression ?. i have been on off depression for the past decade. been on multiple antidepressants, seen multiple psychologists and psychiatrist. had an awful corporate job in the financial sector, with crazy hours 9am to 1 pm and quit as i got fed up and reached a point where i couldn't juggle depression heavy workload. after this, i spent the past 12 months just taking care of myself, moved out, got a new apartment, furnishing and settling in. done a bit of travelling but haven't really done much tbh. been doing diligently therapy, seeing a psychologist every week which has only made things worse from having to remember all those bottled up feelings leaving me fucked up for 24h after each session. gt; now i wanna start looking for a job, but i'm looking for ideas as to how to justify taking a 1 year break without bringing up the mental health issues ? the whole 'i spent the year travelling' isn't very legitimate as if they ask me where i went, i've only been to few places. thoughts and ideas please ?",0

"finally went to a doctor. i don t have a family doctor so had to go to a walk in medi clinic. i actually went yesterday but missed the cut off time which seemed like such a blow. i went and spent some money after bawling my eyes out as i barely had the nerve to go then. i texted my boss saying i d be out going to a walk in today to give myself some accountability. waited 3 hours in the wait room and another half hour in the examine room. got a month of citalopram, had to go do blood work, have to check in after a month, instructed to find a family doctor. i just hope i feel better. i ve had a rare moment of lucidity after a couple months of being in a cloud. hopefully in this process i also get referred to a psychiatrist and am in the midst of look for a good therapist. i have been talking to a councillor through my works eap which has been a tad underwhelming but for the first time i m advocating for myself and taking the steps. i was never really taken care of as a child, my father was an adult man baby who broke us all down to tend to him and as a result i took a lot of responsibility. we always had food and a roof over our head but other needs weren t met. i remember being 12 and telling my mom shouldn t we be getting physicals yearly? shouldn t we be going to the eye doctor? should be get 6 month dental check ups? i never got those things, there wasn t time for it, for my care so now it s hard to do them for myself as they were never meant for me before. i m already depressed, but now the process in getting well reminds me of all this and makes me quite resentful. i will still try my best. today is a relatively good day and i m feeling okay about the thoughts of feeling good again but i know this feeling will ebb and flow.",0
"i'm having a lot of memory issues, and i wonder if it's related to my depression. we've all been there. you forget a word, where you put something, or a task you were supposed to do. but what if this happens multiple times everyday? that's where i'm at right now. i forget words, names, and the things i'm supposed to do. i asked my husband what he was cooking tomorrow, and literally thirty seconds later, i couldn't remember what he said and had to ask him again. i'm becoming increasingly worried about this. it isn't a big deal when it happens once in awhile, but now it's happening so often that i'm worried there's something more going on. i know forgetfulness can be linked to depression, and mine has been really bad lately. the more i think about how bad things are right now with the economy, the environment, and how i may never be able to accomplish my most sought after goals, the worse i feel. i'm 37. i didn't think memory issues would happen for at least another 2 years ",0

"i feel isolated and alone although friends and coworkers know i'm not doing well. so, this is my first post on here. i've mostly been reading and commenting the last few weeks. not sure why i'm doing this now but i guess i just also wanna get shit off my shoulders. quick backstory: adusive narcissistic parents, never allowed to be sad, strict rules, isolated, depressed since around 13, didn't feel safe talking to anyone, made to always feel like the worst and a failure, thought it was all normal. i attempted to take my life at 14. later went to uni, found out my life was far from normal. finally tried to get help and moved out. i am 23 with a stable job and recently cut ties with my parents. back to current time: although i'm getting help, i have a support system, i am dating an awesome girl, i still can't stop my brain from making me feel like shit. like i don't deserve anything. like my feelings aren't valid. everyone hates me. i am starting to spiral now again and have started cutting again. i have ""casual"" suicidal thoughts in the back of my head. i have started seeking ways to get out of this reality, even for just a moment aka alcohol and drugs . and i'm scared of where this is going. i know these thoughts aren't logical but they get to me anyway. i am honest, to an extent, about that i'm not doing good for my coworkers, friends and hr at work. but i don't think they get how serious things have become. and i can't imagine how they would even help in the first place even if they knew. i guess i feel so isolated. i feel that even if i tell people, even if i get help by professionals that i'll always just be stuck in this isolated bubble. stuck with myself. if my doctor can't help me i don't think anyone can?",0

"finally realising how i see myself.. apologies in advance for the dramatic language, it s a but embarrassing but oh well. i realise that ever since i was young, probably about 11, every year that passes has been a notch in the belt of my self hatred. i have watched the approach of new years, birthdays, halloween s, each time promising myself that i will be a better person on this milestone day. a person worth being here. someone better than the person making that promise. each event comes and goes, and i have had to sit back and accept that i am still myself, and that seemingly i will never care about myself enough to change. i will never lose the weight. dye my hair. get a job. get prettier, funnier, be more successful in a way that i can bring up to myself in bulletpoints, to then show to friends or family members who ask how i m doing. but i did make those changes. i did lose weight. changed my hair. got a job. did all the things i wanted to do. and almost as soon as i had them i threw them away. i don t love myself enough to bother trying. even if i prove i can succeed, underneath my success is a person that i for some reason truly do despise. i have never hated another person the way i hate myself. what feels like hatred for others is shown in actions, or more often thoughts, of a passionate nature. imagining hitting, screaming, fighting that person. the hate i have for myself is deeper because it s not this superficial, firey hate that inspires actions. it doesn t go away after time. it s a cold and neglectful hate. i watch myself isolate, run out of medication, eat like shit and sleep like i have nothing worth waking up for. i do nothing about this. or almost nothing. because at the very least i do question myself. i stop and think, wonder why i treat myself this way. i ve done this or some variation of this for the past 13 years. if i had been raising a child this way the product would at best be a self hating shell of a teenager who has no obligation to live other than not wanting to seem ungrateful. but more likely, that child would have died of starvation and neglect over a decade ago. i am shocked. i have known i didn t like myself, but to finally allow myself to truly see, i am just in a state of plain shock. that this is the person i ve become. not looking at my accomplishments or lack thereof. simply my relationship with myself, and just how truly heartless my behaviour towards myself has been. i do feel very remorseful towards my past self. and also ashamed of the self pity. but i just don t know where to go from here.",0

"an ex friend once told me... ...that people who are actually depressed don't complain about or share their sorrows with others. they just smile and laugh and deal with them privately. people who wear their depression on their sleeves and look miserable and sad all the time, just want attention. she's been the type to always be very private about her numerous problems at home parents fighting and hitting each other, controlling, narcissistic mother and brother, one disabled sibling, financial difficulties while i've always just been very open about my feelings and can't help but talk about them when i'm feeling shitty. my problems aren't half as bad, i know i'm more priveleged and have a better life probably mother has been emotionally unavailable and struggled with her physical mental health her whole life, father is busy working and providing for the family, always felt emotionally neglected, failing academically and have no hope of a good future, have no life skills and no friends . she's even made comments in the past about me not even needing to get a glass of water on my own we have househelp for everything , while she has to do household chores and help around the house. she always doubted my experiences when i told her i felt like my parents didn't love me. she thought i was in the wrong for yelling at my mother bc i'm obviously wrong for feeling bitter about never having a proper mother daughter bond with her. she always thought he experiences were far worse than mine. and i agree that i have it better, but that doesn't mean my troubles are not valid. i just realised today though, how much harm her comment caused me overtime. i became very withdrawn and literally stopped talking to everyone because i just didn't want to spread negativity and didn't know how to talk without bringing up all the problems in my life. i went off of all social media. people who don't see me on the daily, i might as well not exist for them. aditionally, i doubt all my experiences and my emotional rsponses to them, and constantly wonder if i'm just being dramatic and want attention, or am i genuinely upset distressed. i just don't want to burden anyone. i am at a stage where i can't express myself properly and also don't want therapy because i think maybe i don't need help, and a therapist's time is better spent helping someone who needs it more than i do. but i will never get better. i just know it. perhaps, it is what i deserve for being an entitled priveleged piece of shit my whole life.",0
"why do i even exist?. the depression comes temporary to me but when it comes, it feels like it is the worst life or worst time, i don't wanna live this anymore. i don't know why but i care about the reputation or respect so much. when someone disrespectfully behaves to me, it brings me intense depression. even the music doesn't work but makes it worse. i have goals, but not devoting myself to it or not willing to. it feels like i am here to be responsible for others only not for me. if i scold myself, nothing changes but if someone else does the same, the intense depression is on the way. i just want to forget this moment and move on but it's not possible. almighty god, do some magic and make me good ",0

fuck it. ive been severely depressed for more than a decade now. i ve tried dozens of therapists and medications with zero improvement. every day i battle suicidal thoughts and frankly there s a dwindling number of reasons not to do it. so basically i ve decided fuck it. i m gonna work until the end of this quarter. planning to cash out my 4 1k ira and take my life savings and do whatever the fuck i want. probably will be able to travel and live pretty well for at least a year. when the money runs out so does my time. figure i should at least try and enjoy what i ve earned before i check out. still figuring out how to discuss with the few remaining friends and family in my life. will probably just tell them i m going away and don t know when i ll be back. even from a young age i always knew i d never make it out of my 2 s. like people would always ask me what i wanted to do or where i saw my life headed and i never had an answer. anyway i know i m probably not the first person to do this but i ll try to keep y all updated on my journey.,0

emotional detached and trying to get better. i ve been dealing with a attachment disorder for as long as i can remember. logically i know it stems from early childhood trauma and repeated trauma throughout my childhood and early adulthood. i m 26 now i have a fianc and a child and i m trying to get better and be more present with them and feel everything i should ve been feeling for the past 26 years. i don t really know where to start though i ve been trying to be more mindful i have my first therapy session next week and don t really know what else i can do to take steps in the right direction at this point. i just know something has to be done if i want to continue my life with the current people in it. if anyone else is having similar issues or a similar detachment problem i d love to talk about it maybe trade some advice,0

"advice on breaking up with someone. i know the title seems bad but i was wondering if anyone had any advice for my situation. i m in a relationship with someone and we both deal with depression and anxiety. recently we both have been at a bad point in our depression and one of the causes my depression has gotten worse is because of this relationship. it was something i noticed a couple weeks ago but i m constantly more emotionally drained and i started talking to my friends less again. we ve been together for quite a few months and we were very close in the beginning but when this started getting bad for the both of us, it wasn t the same anymore. i did like them, i really did but i feel as though the spark i felt in the beginning has dimmed and i m no longer 1 there. the relationship also isn t the most healthy for either of us and i started to think that maybe we shouldn t have gotten together. recently thoughts of taking a break or breaking up have crossed my mind but then i was afraid of the outcome. i m pretty sure i m almost like a lifeline to this person, i m one of the only people who make them happy and help them but i ve become so drained and i m afraid that if i break things off, he may try to unalive himself or hurt himself but i also don t think it s fair for either of us when i m not 1 in it. if anyone could give some advice or insight it would be much appreciated.",0
"when you feel depressed but don t know what to call it..?. i m fairly certain i have no hope for the future. medication is currently not helping it seems, despite my increased dosage from 2 2 21. i cancelled my therapy because it s also too expensive and did not seem to help. using an online therapist due to the pandemic was a useful strategy that did not pan out well and ultimately cost almost 1k that i wish i had back. i ve taken to sleeping starting about 7 9 am in an effort to avoid the rest of humanity during peak times. i usually do not wake until 5 7 pm on the average day. i do my grocery shopping at night with headphones in to avoid others. i have zero adult friends who i speak with regularly via phone or in person, only a handful of folks who i chat with via text and or discord etc. i havnt been invited to an activity by another adult since a friends daughters party in february. i play the same two three video games most days, then sleep when i get bored and or worn out on the repetitive nature. i ve expressed interest in new games only to find myself completely bored indifferent to them, with no way to get excited about what once was an enjoyable activity. i have honestly no hope this will change, and no motivation to make positive changes. i ve heard good things about yoga, meditation, and attempting a more zen lifestyle, nothing like this works for me because i can t settle my mind long enough to do anything meaningful i ultimately just fall asleep, or give up as it s a wasted effort. i eat one meal a day or less with random snacks, i drink water and a few caffeinated sodas, but no alcohol. i gave it up at the start of the year when i lost a promising job in dec. 2 21. someone explain why i don t want to live anymore? i m really just over existing.",0
"can i just be happy again?. i have been depressed and just filled with childhood trauma for years. i do not know who i am, haven't for a while. i am 25, married with 2kids and i regret all of it sometimes. maybe it was to fill in a void of loneliness but it made things worse for me. i just cant seem to let go of being unhappy. i feel unmotivated with life, i feel that i only have energy to do my mom duties and its rinse and repeat. i am tired, i am ready for this life to end already. i just want it to end..",0

"depression can't love. last year, i pulled a rope off my husband's neck as he was trying to hurt himself. after that i lost myself in depression, blaming myself for ruining our lives. i have taken away a lot of his happiness because of the way i am. i call him terrible names and get so angry. verbally and emotionally abusive towards him. i can't leave the house and we have no friends. back and forth we go dancing with my extreme emotions. which wife will it be today happy sad or bitchy. that night we got into a big fight and i called him terrible things. i used to run away a lot when it became too much. i used to hide out in the park bathroom to cry. when i came home he was turning red and couldn't breathe. he said he was tired of being my punching bag. that still haunts me. to be the victim, you victimize others too. to be hurt, means you hurt others too. i was depressed at that time, but i didn't see he was depressed too. the only difference is now, i am depressed again. he moved us a state away this summer to pursue his new, healthier job. i had to quit my career and have been unemployed for 2 months. in this isolation, the depression has come back around and i can't seem to do anything now. i keep thinking back to the trauma we've experienced together. to the way i am and the ways i have hurt him. i keep thinking about how his life would be easier without me in it. he's happier, he's working hard, and he's in a better environment now. things are looking up for him, and so i can be at peace knowing he's okay. yet, he tells me he's sad to leave me when he goes to work and comes home seeing me in the same spot. he tells me he's sad to see me so broken. i don't want to ruin his life anymore. i don't want to be the source of his pain. it doesn't get easier over time. depression always comes back around. this time, i don't know how to stop it. i don't know how to stop life except through death. don't worry i don't plan to end it, it just is how it is. but maybe leaving him will save us from repeating the same mistakes. either way, i love him, and to love somebody sometimes means letting them go, so they can live.",0

"ig this is my only visible of help. i m so fucking tired of living. i thought i was depressed before but this is actual, severe depression. nothing seems enjoyable i m just fighting to find some kind of stimulation for my brain to escape this hell. i ve sheltered myself from the outside world completely, i just sit and rot inside my room. the only excitement or joy i find whenever i wake up and respond to my gf s text and the rest of the day is hell. i live inside my head constantly from the moment i wake up to when i close my eyes to sleep. i ve grown an extreme amount of hatred for myself unlike anyone else on this planet because of it. from overthinking every situation i put in my head to anything i can think of. i ve been tossed around and treated like shit by a lot of people in my 18 years of living. i have no love for myself whatsoever. i have little to no trust in anyone, also because of how i ve been treated. so in my constant state overthinking it always turns to self hatred. that being because of guilt or just being tired of living in my head. for example, i feel guilty for overthinking everything my gf does and thinking almost anything she does is a way to backstab me even tho i m almost positive she isn t trying to hurt me or do me dirty. only because i ve been so scarred by other people. i just can t stand who i am i m filled with rage and uncomfortableness being in my own skin. i ve never been more comforted by the thought of blowing my brains out till now, even when i tried to overdose twice. but lucky me i can t kill myself, i couldn t do that to my family, close friends, and gf. my gf has a grieving disorder which could really fuck her up, and it would also devastate my closest friends for eternity. it gives me a large amount of pain not being able to end my own life another thing, i suffer really horribly with dpdr depersonalization dissociation disorder . nothing feels real and i constantly live life as a spectator and it s only made me more depressed. i can barley even think and output a sentence with people because of how bad it is. when existence isn t comfortable at all with all these intrusive thoughts i have and existential dread thinking. i have really bad ocd and it s part of the reason why i m still dealing with chronic dpdr also, i also have sleep insomnia. so i can t even sleep to avoid depression i just there and be in my head like always but it s even worse whenever i m trying to sleep. and i m aware that healthy amounts of sleep can help a lot with mental health but again, i m blessed with another problem with me. i just need advice, please",0

"doing something even a little bit wrong shuts me down looking if anyone else experiences this.. i don t know if this is the right place for this, or if this is even a depression thing, but it s the only formal dx i ve ever had in my past. so wondering if this is a symptom or if anyone experiences the same thing. any time i make a mistake that other people notice it seems to affect me so strongly it ruins my life for a long time after. other people don t seem to experience this even other depressed people i know, which is why i hesitate to say if this is a symptom of depression . it doesn t matter what it is, but social mistakes seem to be worse than others. if i say something wrong, or do the wrong thing, i basically have an emotional meltdown. it s so embarrassing. i have to hide that i m immediately fighting tears and it s all i can think about for weeks. i remember every embarrassing moment and mistake from my whole life in vivid detail. even if it s an honest and understandable mistake that anyone would make, it ruins me. but if someone else were to do the same thing, i would never judge them so harshly. here s an example: when i was 8 years old, my mom went to pick something up from someone who lived in a house i d never been to. she left me in the car, and told me she would be back soon, but she was gone longer than that. i got worried and went into the backyard of the house i thought she was at, and started playing in a little kid play structure. a lady who lived there came out after a little bit, freaking out at me. i panicked and asked where my mom was, and she made me go out front, and found the house next door where my mom actually was. she chewed me out, then chewed my mom out for leaving me alone, i remember really clearly your daughter was tresspassing. do you know how dangerous that is? my mom tried to make me feel better but i was inconsolable. as an adult in their 3 s with common sense, i know she was at least a little in the wrong to have such an angry reaction about a lost kid. but when i think about it, i still hate my child self, and feel beyond embarrassed. these days when i say things or do things where i m totally in the wrong, i lose it even if other people are being objectively kind or correct in their criticism. it s caused me to drift away from so many friends and activities i enjoy. my opinion of myself is so low at this point i hardly even try to be out or social anymore. is there a name for this? does anyone else feel this or is this just general patheticness? i ve been told so much that i need to stop saying sorry and get a thicker skin, which just makes me feel worse. i don t know what to think anymore, and i m so, so tired of just existing at this point. i m exhausted with the emotional effort of avoiding mistakes, that i don t do much i enjoy any more.",0

"just drained. mega post . basically what the title says. this summer has been the worst summer of my life, and the 2nd lowest i ve felt in my life so far. i really just want to use this post as a safe place to vent, i ve already written in my journal but it s 3 am and i m still having lingering thoughts, so hell why not. well for starters i just recently turned 19 on july 29th. i spent my whole birthday miserable, constantly crying and stressing because i caught my boyfriend, who i ve been with for what would ve been a year next month, cheating on me. i caught him using dating apps behind my back again , and not only that but he d been texting and sending nudes to other people behind my back. this was my first relationship ever and the longest i ve ever been with someone. we both got through our freshman year of college together, and he s the only person that s made my experience a little better. since we ve been together we never missed a day without talking until the days following that whole debacle which was like 2 3 weeks ago . it hurts so much bc he was also my best friend and i trusted and loved him so much, so i feel so broken, betrayed, and naive. at first he tried to say he was using those apps bc he was worried that i was upset bc of our distance it was a long distance relationship , and then he came back and said he felt like i didn t love him as much which felt like a huge slap in the face because i did anything for him . eventually he apologized, and i accepted it. we re trying to move on and rebuild our relationship but it just doesn t feel the same. especially with my anxiety and overthinking getting the best of me since he s stopped calling me and whenever we go long hours without texting. he works from morning to afternoon so i try to be very understanding of that however within the hours of us not texting i d see him actively on social media. well anyways we got into a disagreement yesterday because he complained about the way i texted, and i brought up that situation again. we haven t texted since last night. ik this sounds dumb but i m worried it may now be officially over, and everytime i say that my stomach drops bc he s the only person i have left, and the only person i feel close to. so that took a big toll on me. and now i feel so alone because i ve pushed everyone out of my life, the little friends i had, him, everyone. im very shy, and i have a hard time approaching anyone so i don t really have any friends or a friend group. i m very quiet and i stay to myself a lot. the only other friend that i was actively communicating with randomly stopped talking to me and we haven t spoken since june. i usually always had my boyfriend by my side, so i never felt alone, but now he s gone too. those were just the major causes of my terrible summer. since i came home from school i spent days weeks months on applications and going to interviews just to get declined from every job i applied for. i only recently got a job earlier in the past month at fedex, and i had to leave after 2 weeks bc the work conditions were terrible. i just feel so worthless and lonely. i ve even let go of my looks bc of how terrible i ve been feeling. everytime i feel like things are getting better they get worse, and every day seems to be worse than the previous. every new person i ve met has misunderstood me and in turn left, so i just gave up. i m so tired of crying that i don t even think i have anymore tears left in me now. i just feel emotionless, just a shell of who i used to be. i don t even feel like myself, i feel so broken. i spent the whole summer in the house in my room, playing music and video games. sometimes they help but even that gets boring quick and eventually my thoughts will come creeping back up on me. and now i have to go back to school in 2 weeks not only carrying this stress, but having to worry about getting out of academic probation. stuck in my dorm room again just like last year, with no friends, only this time i won t have a boyfriend either there for me. i just wanna disappear. it s 3 am rn and i m trying to stay up as late as possible so i can sleep all day without having to worry about today s pain. i wish i could never wake up. i occasionally have running thoughts about suicide but i could never bring myself to do it bc i m afraid of pain. i sometimes wonder if i disappeared would it really impact anybody, would anyone really care, would they notice i m gone i kind of feel bad for posting this here bc it just feels so selfish and tiny compared to what other may be dealing with but i just really feel so lost and have a lot i want to get off of my chest. anyways sorry for the long post, i just have a lot on my mind. also sorry if it sounds like i m rambling, i m not good at explaining myself and i usually keep my issues to myself. i guess this all sounded way better in my journal.",0
"my dreams will never come true. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2 15. that wasn't my first episode. the earliest episode i remember was in 2 13. no matter what i did, i just could not find the will to do the things i needed to do. no one noticed because i wasn't suicidal and my grades were unaffected but i remember crying myself to sleep every night. i didn't know what was happening to me and there wasn't anyone i could tell. i'm now 25 and i've had more episodes than i can remember. my life is basically falling apart. i don't have the will to pursue my dreams anymore. if my life continues like this, i doubt that i'll amount to anything. there are unread books on my shelves. there are courses that i've not completed. i haven't cleaned my studio properly in a while. i just lay down and cry and cry. then i start to scream. i scream at the top of my lungs. i scream out the pain and yet it only multiples ten fold. i cry and i scream and i scream again. i live alone in my studio and i've made plans to end my life. sometimes, i think about my parents and wonder what the grief of losing me will do to them. yet, i know that they'll eventually grieve on how my life will turn out because i won't amount to much. i don't even want to be much. i just want to be able to wake up in the morning and offer prayers. i want to be able to take my bath and brush my teeth. i want to make a honest and decent livelihood. i want to come home to my studio and be content. i want to take my walks and read. i want to do funny faces with my niece on instagram calls. i want to sleep soundly. i want to stop crying. i want to stop screaming. i don't even want to be happy. i just want to stop being sad. i am okay with feeling neutral. i don't want so much. i just want to stop feeling tired, sad, weak, hopeless and worthless. i just want the barest minimum. and i take my pills every single day. i take them because i want to be hopeful. on the few good days, i try to get some air. i try to eat my fruits and veggies but nothing works. i'm always back to square zero. i'm never going to make it out of this hell.",0
"adulthood getting tougher. to whom it may concern when your friends and love once s start drifting away, don t assume they are acting busy, adulthood is hard people are going through a lot they can t talk about. don t be deceived by social media post and status update. sometimes people go to bed depressed and cry on bed, racking their heads to earn ends meet, so please stop making false assumptions. the life is beyond what we imaging . i hope these get into you and inspire you all.",0
"i can't handle this anymore. my sweet amazing perfect girlfriend just lost her dad and we're on a break so she can focus more on herself. i feel like it's because i'm too much and i'm scared that she's not going to come back. i've always had a good life, nothing to complain about, but a month or so ago i started having small depressions and crying randomly which i've never done. i would come on this sub and read other people's posts and i found myself relating to a lot of them. after my love and i went on a break, i felt i had reached a breaking point. in about 18 hours i started burning myself and vaping until i was so buzzed i couldn't feel the burns. i've never don't any of that before. i made an appointment with a good therapist but the appointment is on friday and i'm breaking down, i don't know if i'm going to make it until then. i need encouragement and reassurance",0
"it s working?. so my depression likes to come in the form of endless intrusive thoughts, sudden breakdowns, and an inability for me to even remember things properly it s normal for me to forget what i m saying multiple times in a single conversation. but recently i tried this noortropics stuff, basically just vitamins but specifically for your brain. and they came today, i got ones to improve motivation, clarity, rationality, and energy. well i took one of each before work and holy shit. it felt like these intrusive thoughts were auto deleting themselves as they were coming in. not to mention i actually enjoyed myself. i truly, genuinely enjoyed myself. turns out the energy one worked too well because it s 3am. this is just a post to let y all know that i m doing it. im pushing through and things are getting better for me",0
"everyday i slip further into psychosis.. i cant control my thoughts, i never have been able to, ive been through almost every hardship you can go trough from rape to child abuse. i see no point in living when i cant make friends i cant love anybody i cant work i cant feel o.k. life has always been a downward spiral growing up poor and still being fairly poor, i was kicked out of my home of 7 years now living in a basement with grandparents that dont even want me here. good thing i live on the highway.",0
"mega vent. my brother has been behaving in an aggressive thuggish manner for the last 3 years now, he's disrespectful with parents, aggressive, wants to do whatever he wants and to be given whatever he wants, otherwise he'll snap and start shouting and being aggressive, leaves the house dirty kithcen all shitted up with food and never clean , wakes up my parents every night in the middle of it, literally every night basically, bc he watches tv and is loud when cooking at 3am or doing stuff. my parents in my opinion handled this in a stupid way, they just talk, complain to him, tell him what to do not to do like he cares , then start arguing even between the 2 of them bc they told him to do 2 different things they disagree on, then start discussing, my brother goes out with subhumans lowlifes, sells drugs, gets drunk, steals cheap stuff or alchol from stores. my parents refuse to expel him from the house , especially my mother, bc hes 17 so she says that he'll get caught by the police for something and then they'll call and they'll have to take him back otherwise theyll get sued for abandoning him, but also even when they can be ""relaxed"", better said left alone, they sekk him because ""he's still our son"", so for example this exact night as im writing to vent, as of 3 minutes ago: my brother came home drunk, they told him to go to bed etc thats the main thing bc he always wakes them up so they want him to sleep, also he sleeps all day till 12 16pm, , he refused and an argument ensued, also thanks to their retarded way of handling the thing which is ranting on what he has to do etc and venting their stress, while he doesnt do what they told him and it happened that it got physical once and he assaulted my father and then i intervened and assaulted my brother, then my father said he was having a hearth attack and we stopped anyway in the end they managed to make my brother go out of the house, so what does my father do after 2 mins? he goes out to search him, different variations of this have been happening literally on loop almost every day for the last 3 years, my parents arent divorced but just in the eye of the law. note that i assaulted my brother 3 times, once he shitted up the kitched, i asked him to clean, he refused smugly, i snapped and started punching him in the ribs, not even a fight it lasted 3 seconds at most then we separated, another time i came home from running and came to the garage and heard spitting sounds and saw a light on inside it, it was my brother with a friend and he was spitting inside the garage, it was closed, i told him to stop and he again refused smugly, i opened the garage and punched him in the face and a fist fight ensued, it lasted some minutes and i knocked him down kinda once when you see all the white stars and jump a second forward in time , then my mother came home from work and started shouting and we stopped. then the third that i mentioned earlier he assaulted my father after the usual shit bc my father snapped this time and punched him, i came downstairs im usually a passive listener to the arguemtns bc my presence would only worse things, especially given how they want to manage the situation . i called the cops i think 2 3 times saying he was assaulting my father, they came 45 minutes later and he was either gone or they just brought him to the station, and the let him come back the same day after a few hours, they dont give a shit about the whole situation, but if i killed him then they would care and actually arrest me the faggots, my parents even called the cops saying he had drugs true and they didnt arrest him bc that one time he didnt have it my parents found it multiple times , he got arrested for stealing a shirt, did nothing, so basically for the law you just have to be a passive and do nothing, bc if as i said killed him or if my parents abandoned him, its probable sure they'd do something this time, especially the first case. i can go live alone im 2 but im doing uni and here in italy id be a wagie forever if i go working now i know bc i already worked and am currently, in the last 3 years summers, this included, i worked, and the pay is miserable for full time jobs, like 1 euros months if youre lucky, otherwise less, for full time, if you go in the trades you can make slightly more but have long ass hours, but in general all those arent things id want to have to do for the rest of my life , also yesterday he came knocking on my door at :4 , i made the stupid error of opening, he wanted me to open the house door so he could go out do his stuff, i refused, and he insisted its favourite method, to just tire you down until you concede, my parents always do so it works for him, especially my father so he always asks him , i refused bc i hate him, he sat on my chair and said he wouldnt leave until i said yes, then started saying that i've always bullied him since he was little and always beat him up false, when we were little it happened we had little sibling fights or that i hit him because he annoyed me on purpose sometimes, but it was rare, often we played toghter too so its made up and exxaggerated , anyway he then starts saying he can have me killed by his friends with just one phone call etc, then challenges me to attack him and fight him to remove him from my room since i asked him to leave, we stay there a couple of minutes in silence looking at each other and i think what to do, assaulting him doesnt seems advantageous, i see it as a 5 5 , not good odds, then i decide to fake conceding, i take the keys and tell him i'll do it, he starts going downstairs in front of me, i tought about kicking him down the stairs and then beating him while he was down but he was suspicious and kept looking behind him, anyway he went take his shoes and i locked him out of my room and the upper floor where my room is, he snapped and started screaming and saying hell kill me etc, i called the cops again, btw i have no faih in them theyre useless faggots, but i always hope something happens and they finally arrest him or shoot him, like if he assaults them which he half assedly did multiple time btw , ah yes also one time he was arrested bc he beat up a guy while he was out idk the detail, he said the guy was making fun of him, people called the cops, he assaulted them, got handcuffed and brought to the station, released same day, meaniwhile i was behind a wall behind the door with my bowie knife in case he broke in, a tactic i already used with succes is to close my bedroom door to make him think im loked in then hide behind a wall or in the adjacent room or something like that, the other time he fell in the trap then my father calmed him, this time he didnt get inside. i sincerely would like to kill him myself, the problem is the probability of getting away with it are slim and i dont want to ruin my life forever for that, so idk, i try calling the cops when he snaps but they dont do shit, arrive 45 minutes late, or like today they dont even come after saying they will, ofc they know our names from the previous times so when i call they know what it is and they avoided it this time also theres the excuse of mental illness and that he takes meds, goes to the psycologist and psychiatrist, so hes not a subhuman piece of shit but hes mentally ill depending on my parents mood its one or the other but their actions indicate the mentally ill thing is what drives their actions since they keep staying behind him . so idk i hate staying at my house, when i hear a voice while at home i get alerted and have to go look whats going on, i always lock my door when i sleep, i have the desire of killing my brother and stab him while he sleeps in the neck multiple times, most days the evening is filled with adrenaline and tension because of the stuff that happens, and also i dont like how i am bc at the moment im being a subhuman that goes to bed late, plays alot videogames, and doesnt study, i like reading books but i rarely do, i like going outdoors but i rarely do, i have no friends, but i have a gf lol, im being shit at uni, im behind with exams, and feel constantly unsatisfied by myself bcause of those reasons while also doing nothing, also i stopped working out, before i was ripped as fuck, i did competitive boxing, then the will waned and i stopped, now i work out rarely like 3 times a month i go running but thats it. my only consolation is that at least im working, btw the first year i got scammed and worked 1 11 hours a day for 3 weeks as a waiter and got 2 euros, the year after i did real estate agent 5 weeks got 1 euros, fine, but my parents stopped giving me allowance 2 4 euros every 3 4 months because i make it last, btw they complain if spend them on stuf i like such as milsurp gear instead of what they like such as restaurants, which i love but theyre expensive so i dont want to blow my money , anyway i made my 1 euros last like 5 months including a vacation but for the rest i didnt buy anything i wanted like a retard so its like i didnt work, bc i knew they would give me allowance again if i finished them. now i worked in a warehouse for 2 weeks approx but the manager was a retard and snapped on me bc i asked him info on the contract he offered me since it was very different from what we had talked about, so i left, at least theyll pay me the weeks i did, or so they say, now i have a cushy job i a restaurant of people i know, i do part time 4 5 hourse at dinner usually and they pay 35 3 a day when i do the whole 4 5 hours today there wasnt many people so i only stayed 2 hours then they closed so i got 2 euros , its cushy, pays kinda well, its close to home, but they close in 2 weeks plus they already have a waiter but hes on vacation so idk if itll keep going after the summer. anyway thats my wall of text vent bc i have no friends and my gf already knows all of this and i dont want to repeat it to her a 1 times plus shes not well at the moment with health nothing serious so i dont want to burden her, oh and to add to the misery my father has a spine problem so he basically almost cant walk, at least without huge pain so theres that, i always hear him moaning and suffering when he moves.",0

"it's pointless, and sometimes insulting.. i'm growing tired of the concept of getting help. therapists, strangers, family, whatever. it just frustrates me. any disagreement with my declaration of hopelessness and suicidal desires just feels like invalidation and nothing else at this point. i feel incapable of explaining anything about myself in a way others can comprehend. my words don't feel valuable anymore. oh well, everyone wants to be a hero. let's not pretend like some of the 'helpers' out there are doing it for others out of the kindness in their heart. a lot of it is just for themselves. you ask for help and you probably get a comment or a dm, you respond to it, then they cease to exist. maybe you get some back and forth for 2 minutes if you're lucky. or even worse, you're on the brink of ending your life and this is the kind of savior complex regurgitated bullshit you're met with: ""please don't leave i care i promise it'll get better work out smoke weed you'll get through this "" that, or they just try cramming christ down your throat. these dense chumps with no self awareness who want to make themselves feel good because they threw some arbitrary words of positivity into a blender and tossed the result in your face. what great people they are, they should pat themselves on the back. i'm glad they're commonly christian too, so they can go to hell while they're at it. makes me sick to my stomach. fuck asking for help anymore, it only makes me want to neck myself even more.",0
"isolation and compartmentalization ruined my relationship with my family. hi. i m gonna vomit because i need an outlet. rough childhood. youngest to 3 older brothers. shit hit the fan when i was young within my family. just one example: i was born during the trial for my grandma s pedophilia i was not a victim, my brothers were . so, now that i m older, i m realizing all of my terrible depressive habits have been implanted since day 1 because they were survival mechanisms for the shit show that was my home life. i hate myself. i have dirt poor self esteem. my life is incredibly compartmentalized. and my form of self harm is being a workaholic. i don t do anything i love. i can t bring myself to. but most of all, i can t have a relationship with my parents. my family is significantly better now. every family member in my life goes to therapy except for me , my parents are incredible people and i m so lucky to have them because they were able to personally change and provide for my brothers and i, even through the traumatic events. all that to say i want a relationship with them. so. badly. i love my mom and my dad. but i haven t told them that since i was a literal toddler. i think this stems from compartmentalizing my relationships. i was and still am the good normal child, unproblematic, high achieving, classic case of stuffing my feelings in a suitcase and not revealing any of them. my relationship with my family is very transactional as a result. it s hard to describe, but i feel like a burden if i m not just a ghost. i know it s irrational, but my brain is like: mom: generic greeting me: cannot respond to greeting even though i desperately want to. i simply ignore her. mom: how was your day? me: fine any plans? no. you know how it goes. it s extremely cold behavior. they don t know me. i don t smile around them. they don t know my hobbies. they don t know my favorite foods. i can t be a person to my parents. i just can t. that s not what my brain thinks our relationship is for. i exist to make their lives easier. my friends are the people who are allowed to know me. not my family. graduating high school was terrible. i hated having to be the object of my family s attention with no way to circumvent it i m the only one of my brothers to graduate high school, so it was a big deal for them . anyways, exposition over, here s the current issue: i m young. i m 18. i live with my family. i m about to move to college in 2 weeks and forever not be a kid anymore. so, i want to make the most of these last two weeks. i know they re precious. i don t want an emotional repeat of my graduation. but i can t. i can t open up. i can t walk out of my room and just spend time with them. i can t have a conversation with them. the thought of doing so makes me so uncomfortable. in general i m in the dumpster right now, mentally. feeling hopeless about my future, especially with regards to my interpersonal relationships. any consolations at all would be appreciated because i have the opportunity to change my life once i move and start anew , whatever that means. thanks for reading if you cared to. if you re struggling too, i hope we both find our peace and our zest again.",0
"whenever i reflect on my life, it's one l after another, worthless even.. just turned 2 a week ago. but some background first. as a child i was abused, beaten, and pressured to perform well at school despite my adhd. i was beaten to the point of hospitalization, witnessed the attempted suicide of my beloved father, and eventually lost him when he jumped off a roof. i was diagnosed with major depressive shortly after. i did well at school but choked my college entrance exam, so now i'm in an associate degree program, in hopes of getting back into university. til now i've never had a girlfriend, i peddle the story of ""my dad forbidden relationship til i was 18"" but that's bullshit. all my friends are fucking their brains out in university, waiting for a cushy job after they leave, while being on 4 different antidepressants has rendered me impotent at 2 , and i'm stuck in an associate degree and missing a father. to top it all off, i was pretty good looking back when i was 16 or 17 at 72kg. but after covid and the isolation of lockdowns, my depression kicked into high gear and i started to eat and eat, until i'm currently at 1 kg, and with a fat face that ruined any chances i have with any women. how many more ls can i get? i've watched my friends surpass me in every way imaginable. in academics, romance, achievements etc. while i'm here in the bottom on my fat ass ranting on reddit. i contemplate suicide every single day. the only thing keeping me alive is family. my mom used to beat me until i can barely walk. after my dad's departure she changed dramatically and now tries her best to be a great mother to me and my brother. and for my little brother, he gets fs in school so he's unlikely to find a job. both of them need me, and with my dad gone i have to take care of them.",0

"job hunting while depressed a rant. just needed a place to say this. job hunting while depressed is a serious trigger. i had mentioned to a friend that i was burnt out at my current job, and starting looking in a completely different industry. it just so happened that his brother had a connection in one of my dream job industries, so he told me to send my info and resume to his brother, and his brother would ""put me on top of the pile."" i'm sure i don't have to tell anyone here that between the burn out, the imposter syndrome, and the depression just getting a decent cover letter written was a fucking roller coaster. how are you supposed to convince other people to give you a chance when you have nothing good to say about yourself? i deleted and retyped the thing probably twelve times. it still sort of sucked, but i sent it anyway. and now i feel like i'm putting my friends' brother in a weird spot, because he said he'd help me out but what if he sees my stuff and thinks, ""she's got no experience and very little going for her, she's got no chance."" but he has to ""put me on top of the pile"" anyways because he said he would. i realize this is just the depression talking, and that worst case scenario is i just don't get an interview. but the whole time i just kept thinking....... i'm depressed because i'm stuck in a job i don't really want, but the depression is making it so hard to get out of that job. so i stay, and i get more depressed. and it's even harder to get out. i wish there was some sort of industry made specifically for depressed people. where getting a chance at an interview doesn't depend on how much and how well you can brag about yourself. and interviewing well doesn't depend on how good you are at bullshitting and spinning words. i guess thats the end of my rant. i think i'm gonna go cry myself to sleep.",0

"help?. edit: i managed to clean most of my room, taking a break as it s 1 now and been cleaning it since 6 : the fruit flies are still literally everywhere but they should die now considering there s no food s hello friends w depression, i wanted to ask if this happens to anyone else. i have severe chronic depression, mostly from living w an abusive family who treat me horribly and used to beat me as a child. i m trying to get out, i actually have a job interview on tuesday which i am looking forward to, but the aftermath of my depression room has started an infestation of fruit flies. i can hear them buzzing around me as i sleep, has anyone else had this..? i tried to confide with my abusive mother who recently moved in w me and my grandma after being kicked out bc she believed it s okay to not pay her rent and thought she was invincible, and instead screamed at me bc the flies were coming out of my room. i just wanted her to ask if i was okay or something, but that s literally never happened before so why would it now? i m going to clean my room properly, top to bottom today, in preparation for a new life. if i get the job from the interview i m moving out. nothing can save me from my depression if i stay here. i m constantly traumatised, having ptsd flashbacks, surrounded by the people who caused 98 of my trauma. it s gotten worse since my parents moved in. there s literally hundreds in my room, and it s disgusting.. i disassociate in my depressive episodes so i can t remember how i got here. one minute my room was clean, the next i m sat here tonight surrounded by hundreds of them. i don t realise it till it gets to this point. all of my issues will be solved once i move out, i m generally a happy person, i just am always afraid to leave my room so i keep food and hoard it in my room.. which causes flies.",0

"i'm just so lonely. first off: boring exposition. i was bullied for most of my adolescent years around age 1 to 18 and missed out on any social experience you'd probably have in that time. then i switched schools and things started looking up because i got a fresh start and somewhat managed to hide my social incompetence. i at least made some superficial friendships that didn't last past graduation. right after graduating i started having chronic pain that lasted for 2 years and left me bedridden for 6 months while the few people i was still in contact with at the time moved on with their lives. after i somewhat recovered i enrolled in university but was too socially awkward to make any new acquaintances. so here i am 4 years into uni: i'm in my mid 2 s. the only ""friend"" i have is someone from university but we basically don't meet outside of study groups. never been in a relationship or anything of the sort. don't have any real hobbies and basically nothing to do outside of university no courses this semester and work i come in maybe once every two weeks when there's something to do . most days i wake up, turn on my computer, turn it off again 1 minutes later because there's nothing to do and just lie in bed waiting for the day to be over. i can't find the energy to do anything. i moved into a new apartment a few months ago and it still looks like i just moved in because i can't motivate myself to unpack my stuff just so it can sit on a shelf. i'm just so lonely. whenever i do somehow meet new people its mostly through others and i feel like i'm always just the ""friend of a friend"" that is instantly forgotten afterwards. i don't know if this makes sense, but: the only joy i have experienced in recent years was when i could help the people around me with their problems, but there is just no one around to ask me for help. i know the ""obvious"" approach would be getting into a hobby that allows me to meet new people but i either can't find any interest in a new hobby or i'm too terrified of those kinds of social interactions. i don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings. my relationship with my family is too superficial and i don't want to lose the only friend i have left. i've tried getting professional help a few times over the years but i couldn't even get an appointment with a therapist since they were always overwhelmed with patients, so i gave up on that. i've been prescribed antidepressants before for my chronic pain but i honestly didn't feel any change in my emotions mindset motivation. i just don't know what to do.",0
"this is who i am. i've come to think of myself a person who's alive but dead at the same time. i'm constantly getting disappointed at the things and people around me which only cause me to fall deeper in to the though of not trying. throughout the years of so much bullshit in this good for nothing like of mine there has been nothing but moments of insanity my ""happiness"" is cut short from the realization that i'm so alone and that literally no one fucking wants me. no one does. everyone, and i mean everyone tosses me around and treat me like trash, no one that i've ever had contact with, truly appreciate me not even a fraction of how i'm willing to appreciate someone. i've gotten to the point where i don't even try anymore. i don't have friends, i don't have anything. my only company is the monster that i've created to keep me going and the only thing i look forward is the day my shitty life ends. i have so much hatred for myself and this world and everyone that's in it. i'm not enough and i never will be. my head is filled with voices and thoughts and ideas and just darkness. my heart is completely black. i feel alone and want it to end from the moment i wake up to the moment i fall asleep. no one wants me and no one ever will and because of that i've decided to become strong for all the wrong reasons. i'm the villain of this story, the only reason i'm still alive is to become a demon, just like the ones inside of me. it's the only reason why i'm still here. to fight and to struggle. because i've become a sadist to the idea of me against everyone else",0

why does my best friend make me sad?. he s one of my best friends from when i was in 5th grade but recently all he does is argue with me then ignore for hours. i m so hurt it s like no one wants me around and he makes me feel like a joke. and said some racist stuff about me and implied i wouldn t get it cause i m not one of his in person friends. what he said really hurt me because when i said something like that one time he got really mad and said i was replacing him i wasn t it s hard for me to make friends i thought he d be proud but he wa acting toxic and i feel super selfish.,0

"depression and compulsive behaviors. is it good to not have compulsive behaviors when trying to heal from depression? i've been dealing with depression for quite sometime and ive had many unhealthy compulsive behaviors. like porn for example. i have been fighting my compulsion and i'm wondering if it helps healing or coping from depression alot smoother and maybe faster, if i completely cut out all of those self medicated ways? like just living with the raw depression and natural healing stuff like meditation.",0
i wish it would get better. my so called friends left me a long time ago as one of them hit me because i was trying to be on the right moral side and the group broke up. i have never really had any proper friends since i have people i talk to online but they either live far away or more recently say i'm a bit full on. my personality being quite geeky and awkward steers most people away from me and i feel left out of everything life slowly feels like its coming to an end. i'm quite smart but always upset or in a bad mood and struggle to have motivation all the time. music is one of my only escapes as well as being able to talk to someone i trust i struggle with my gender and identity a lot so you can see as to why i might feel quite lost. i have attempted suicide twice in my past don't feel the need to as much anymore and still can easily get help but i cant say it wont make a comeback for me i only pray for a miracle at this point,0
"how do you fill the time?. lately it's like i've been unable to bring myself to do anything at all. i'm starting grad school in the fall and i have a remote summer job, but i don't spend that much time on it and there's a lot of empty space in my life. i live alone and have fallen out of touch with most of my friends, and none of my interests are interesting anymore. i open a video game, play for maybe half an hour, then close it again. i can't bring myself to start any new tv shows or books. some days i can't even make it through a youtube video. the other day someone asked me what i did over the weekend and i realized that i legitimately don't remember. i have no idea where my time goes anymore. it's like i'm just waiting for each day to be over. what do you do all day when things are bad? how do you take your mind off everything when nothing is remotely appealing? it's never been this bad before.",0
"staying employed with depression. sorry if this is a bit ramble y. i started this job a while ago; my first job out of school. it's barely in my field, but i really don't mind the work. unfortunately, my department head is another story. he's abrasive to say the least. ya know those awful intrusive thoughts that tend to stick in your mind? it's like he knows them and uses them like weapons. it doesn't feel like ""critique"" but more like hardcore criticism of my work and myself. he'll compare me to my more established co workers, offer little reassurance or praise on my work, and will degrade when possible. he doesn't believe i ""look mentally ill"" because ""i'm just so put together."" however, he has told my co workers that i'm mentally ill and on meds i hadn't told anyone about the meds and told him that i'm depressed in confidence. sidenote: i put a whole bunch of effort in my appearance, in hopes that i'll feel a little more confident while going through my day. it almost kind of helps. i've only been here a few months not even long enough to justify a resume spot yet. it's so hard waking up to go work with that. he dug in enough where i had a full blown panic attack earlier this week and it's really been affecting my morale. i've barely been holding it together. yes, it's a job during a recession. yes, it pays bills. i should be happy, but i feel my brain getting worse and worse. i've job hopped in the past usually due to me not taking care of my mental health and i don't want to quit this on a whim if my boss is the only bad part of the job. still, it's hard when i work like 6feet away from the guy. how do you stay employed when your worst thoughts insecurities about yourself are coming out of someone else's mouth? any advice would be appreciated. thank you",0

"is there a point making friends?. lately i've been feeling that it's better to be completely alone, i'm not sure how to communicate to people and i think i'm a rather boring person to talk to. i am an artist, but i feel like that's the only thing i have going for me. most of the conversations i've had are just...awkward, i don't know how to say the right words or carry on a conversation sometimes. i'm usually not around people that much in real life besides my family, which probably contributes to my social anxiety since i rarely go out. i do think being depressed and having mood swings most of the time also affect my ability to have friends, i'm not sure who would want to talk to me. i don't think i'm a toxic person to be around, but i don't know, i'm just starting to think that it's a good idea to stop talking to people. i'm only able to speak to people online, but it seems rather useless to me now. it doesn't help that i feel lonely all the time, and i get jealous of people who find it easy to make friends and keep them. i'm not sure why i'm making a post, i guess i just needed to get these feelings out, i doubt anyone would read this really.",0
"meaninglessness. we are all just random thoughts and emotions trapped inside a squishy brain driving an ever aging and rotting body of meat, blood, and water, suffering each day on a planet that is controlled by a few moronic individuals who are obsessed with the devolution of the human race, green strips of paper, and killing anyone that doesn t do as they say as everyone else becomes more and more isolated and lonely as the population grows exponentially life doesn t exist i just want to fucking kill myself so i don t have to suffer anymore, but there is something microscopic in my brain that won t let me do it, even though the constant voices and memories from my past tell me i need to the pain of existence and loneliness is just so overwhelming and overbearing every moment of every day ",0

"turning the switch off and on.. i've dealt with depression since my early teens. it started slowly then spiraled out of control to the point of self harm. i meet my wife and the love of my life in high school. we were one year apart both in age and grade level. now i am 3 and she is 29. we have been together since 2 8. well about 7 years ago my depression got bad enough i was close to ending it all but the thought of the pain i would cause her stopped me and that's when i decided to make it happen. i buried all my emotions deep and turned the switch off that made me a caring person, towards her and everything. it turned into this soulless and emotionless thing. well in 2 16 she got pregnant and i was still the same cold person. it was bad enough i felt nothing when my daughter was born. it took me almost 2 years to feel something towards her. but it was not enough, since the while time it had been putting a huge strain on my marriage. i cared about my family but it was hard to show it, and i couldn't not see my whole world crumbling around me. well, fast forward to today. i recently made the switch turn back on. and everything has come pouring out, like the walls of a dam breaking. i am feeling things i haven't felt in a long time. i even remember what it felt falling for my wife back in school. unfortunately she has decided that we need a break. more that she needs a break. and well we decided to separate but i am devastated because i don't want to loose her even though i think is too late for that. i want to win her back. she and my daughter are my whole universe. i wish i would've seen it sooner. also the depression came back even stronger with the headaches that i used to get when i was young. no meds can make them go away. she tells me that we can start over as friends again untill we both have worked on our issues and then we can see where the future takes. the only thing i can hope for is that my future involves me growing old with her. but with everything in my mind and all i've been feeling. it feels like a loosing battle. only thing keeping me going is her and our daughter. but there's just only so much fight that a person has in them. i will trying to keep going. thank you for your time.",0
"reasons for past self harm and current depression. originally i wasn t suicidal but i had depression, my parents put me on prozac which acted as a activator for suicidal thought and depression for me. i was on it for about 2 years before my family found out i was cutting and was leaving deep scars on my legs that are still very visible till now. it calmed down for a while but then i got into a relationship and i started on my arms and i wasnt connecting the dots that the relationship was why i was cutting again. eventually i realized but i was lonely and i decided to stay decpite the pain i was causing myself because of it. i was ruining myself because i had these 3 minutes of happiness a day when i was holding her but then i eventually ended it. i was still depressed due to a different ex s very controlling friend staring rumors that i raped someone because i didn t want to date her instead. but fast forward a couple months and my parents signed me up for martial arts. i did it for 6 months then switched due to that martial art not being as traditional and diciplinary as i was looking for. but in the end martial arts is whats helping me everyday. even tho, im still having trouble finding genuine people to talk to and it hurts. when i try to talk to people ab this they call me an incel or pick me and it also hurts more than people think. i am adopted. i had abusive bio parents and so thats all my sister and i knew. we got taken from our parents and were taken in by my bio aunt and after a little while she couldnt control us due to us hurting eachother because thats what we were around. my sister and i got separated for 13 years. still havent seen eachother since but even tho i don t remember a thing about her, i still miss her snd feel that until i meet her, if i can ever find her, i will always have a peice of me missing. amp; x2 b; am i wrong for this?",0

"frustration with the psychiatric and mental health institution.. when i was in my early twenties i attempted to kill myself. before that i struggled with depression but it had gone largely undiagnosed for most of my early life. my mother died when i was young and my father was physically abusive and would not let my wellbeing be a priority. i performed well in academics and with a scholarship and 2 years active duty in the military i paid my way to go to a prestigious college. unfortunately my depression rapidly got worse after i began. that winter i attempted to kill myself and was luckily noticed by security at the hotel in which i was attempting to do so. i then spent time in an inpatient facility in which i was formally diagnosed with depression and treated with an ssri and went through several outpatient programs. for some, i think that is where the story ends, but not for me; my depression got worse and worse. i exercised daily, meditated regularly, ate a healthy balanced diet, went to therapy regularly and went through more prescriptions than i can count. i was put on multiple ssri's, an snri, a tricyclic, an maoi and i tried mood stabilizers valproic acid is the worst , anti psychotics, and wellbutrin along side my anti depressants. nothing worked and my anhedonia got so bad that i lost all interest in sex, food, and, well, pretty much everything. i wouldn't eat or sleep for days and i couldn't keep my job. down more than fifty pounds and on the verge of being evicted from my apartment, i desperately looked for alternatives. i found a way to try ketamine infusions, psilocybin, and rtcms. none of it worked. at the behest of a fellow doctor, my psychiatrist put me on vyvanse. i didn't expect it to be any different but it was. it was a stimulant and that helped me get out of bed, but more than that there was also a disconnected effect that i noticed even when i was off of it. i had less anxiety and for once in a long time i could feel things. i could laugh, i could cry, i could have sex with a pretty girl and enjoy it; my life suddenly had color again. i started working on things that i had a passion for long ago and those passions took off. my passion turned into a job and that job into a career. i met friends and grew close to people. i met the love of my life and moved in with her. i was on the drug for 7 years and my life had turned around. i still had to battle my depression, but it was manageable. when mental health professionals learned that i was on vyvanse i would suddenly notice a change in tone, however. ""we are taught not to give stimulants for depression"" they would tell me and they'd say ""you should be careful about becoming dependent."" but those worries weren't consistent with my experience. the ssri that i took with it had worse withdrawal symptoms and often i would forget to take the vyvanse for several days. it was when i was struggling that it helped and i never felt the need to take more than the low dose that i did take the lowest available dose . recently my prescribing doctor had fallen ill and became unavailable with no one to cover due to covid and for the first time in many years i approached other doctors to obtain my prescriptions. as a result, i have basically had to go cold turkey from all my active medications. even when i was just asking for the lexapro which really fucks me up with withdrawal , the fact that i even mentioned vyvanse would cause hesitancy. one psychiatric nurse, without asking about my mood, well being, or history simply stated that i shouldn't be ""trying to get speed from doctors and should consider rehab."" when another doctor suggested several medications that i had already been on with no benefit cymbalta and then nardil and i expressed reservations, he pushed back and said that my lack of openness was a sign of drug seeking behavior. the experience of constantly being told that the one thing that has worked for me makes me a drug addict has put me back into that place i was seven years ago. i feel like i am alone again in that apartment helpless to this illness which is once again consuming my life. i have been off vyvanse for 3 months now and i can no longer have sex with my girlfriend. i struggle to feel anything when she tells me that she loves me or when i see the smile of my niece. i have no interest in my passions again and my chess set and laptop have begun getting dusty. once again, i am going through a bunch of crazy medications which are doing everything but helping. i feel like i've been run through a sham. i feel like the big difference between back then and now is only that now my depression impacts and hurts those that have come to depend on me. i am now desperate again. i have obtained ketamine and adderall and tried both and neither have helped. i am considering going off of my anti depressant to try psilocybin and am starting to look for places that offer ect and rtcms out of the country. increasingly what i have discovered and the source of a lot of my frustration is that my interactions with the psychiatric community have grown to be somewhat toxic. i genuinely do not feel like my current psychiatrist wants to help me he doesn't seem one bit alarmed when i inform him of my increased suicidal ideation and simply wants to cycle through snris, tricyclics, and maois regardless of their impact , and i've been called a drug addict by more than one mental health practitioner. what is most alarming, however, is that in conversations with others that have drug resistant depression, i have found a similar theme. i have met, at this stages, at least a dozen people who had to turn their entire life upside down and or do something illegal and dangerous just to get treatment that worked for them. i have met folks who cannot afford ect and rtcms and cannot function without it both with and without psychotic symptoms . i have met several people who have been forced to grow or buy their own medication illegally and at least one person who had legal trouble as a result . i have met others who have the same experience with vyvanse many of which have faked adhd in order to obtain it . why in this day and age, are there so many of us that have to operate outside of the system which exists to help us in order to get help ? tldr: i was taken off the medication that worked for 7 years, called a drug addict, and now am struggling to fight my depression. in my desperation to get help, i have been surprised to learn that many others with similar depression have resorted to illicit or extreme measures to get the help that they know works for them.",0
"i feel numb,stressed, and lonely when i get home from school. this is like a seasonal depression thing i guess, i noticed i m always like sad or whatever around this time in august and up until maybe september. after i get done with my hw which is the first thing i do when i get home, i either workout if i didn t have a heavy session in weight training today or just practice boxing. after i get done with all of that the lonely, numb, lost feeling comes back. i have a girlfriend but like we can t really hangout anymore because one she always wants to work like everyday at her job, only days she really has off is tuesday and friday sometimes. her mom hates me cause after we broke up and then got back together like 2 in a half months ago she told me that her mom dislikes me now and yeah. i feel like our conversations get dry, i love her very much and she always tells me she loves me too and is always the first one to facetime me at night. but i don t know how to explain the feeling it s like a feeling that i m unsure and i feel like it s not going to be the same and i really want it to be cause i know god didn t just bring us back together for no reason like i love this women man very much but i can barely see her. i feel like i should be doing more throughout the day and if i just sit in bed i feel like i m just wasting time. i wanted to do soccer again this year but i feel like i ll be more stressed with school work but my classes aren t really that hard and my teachers are great but i don t know i feel like i won t have time for my girlfriend anymore either, but i genuinely want soccer more. i really need advice on where to go right now i feel lost in my life right now doing the same things everyday and feeling the same way like i want to feel better than i did yesterday i just really don t want to feel numb right now i want a better mentality where i can go throughout the day without thinking my girlfriend is doing me wrong or im not gonna be able to do this and that and thinking negatively.",0

"just my thoughts. i emigrated to a new country, while i was facing depression and anxiety, financially under pressure, and emotionally i have no one. my roommates don't talk to me because i apparently raised my voice when i requested them to close the door gently at night. a psychiatrist i visited told me to take medicine, i want to but my sister tells me to go to a psychologist first, i did and she also told me to take the medicine while doing therapy. i depended on my sister a lot, as i was facing depression for a few years, and i could not do well in my profession, i depended on her and now i feel lost. i am not in touch with my parents, and my sister has abandoned me, she does not talk to me, and she says she can't help me anymore, that i make her sad, and i don't want to. i just found a good friend back in my home country. she understands me. but she is also not very well. i can't bother her much about my problems. i am alone doing things i have never done before, with no emotional support while facing depression, and whenever i want to talk to my sister, she keeps yelling at me ""why are you like this, i have not seen anyone like you, don't take the pills, they are bad,"" and now she has stopped talking to me which i understand. but she does not understand it's not in my control. i think i should take the medicine, this is affecting me and my relationships. so i can focus and progress in these hard times, i can't control my emotions. i have many other issues rooting back to my family and childhood, i have ocd. things that i have not worked on for so long, are now like a bomb. with all the difficulties, finding a job, and studying, i am trying hard to hang in there. i don't know what to do. i think i just need someone to talk to. to tell me to keep going. i feel exhausted, physically and emotionally, and alone. now i am taking sleep pills. i decided to use the medicine for anxiety. perhaps they make me get my routines back and a place to myself. now i miss my routines.",0
"i just want it to be over.. i don t deserve to be alive. for the most part i have those thoughts under control but then i m reminded of what an inconsiderate, uncompromising, lazy asshole i am and how i have ruined and continue to ruin my relationships by alienating the other person. all i can think about is what a waste of air i am. just a waste of space, time, effort, air, and money. just making everyone else s lives more difficult. i don t know how i m supposed to go on.",0
"i ve been depressed for as long as i can remember, i have no personality because of it, and i don t know if i can or want to get better.. basically what the title says i ve struggled with depression since i was a preteen. in the last few years it s gotten much worse i don t remember the last time i wasn t struggling to get through the day. all i want to do now is get blackout drunk or sleep because i can hardly stand to be conscious. i am the most boring, miserable person to be around even if i try my hardest to be upbeat. i have no personality anymore and i don t remember what my personality was like when i did have one. it s because of that that i don t see a reason to get better. i have no idea if there s a human being to salvage out of this dark hole i ve been in. i also don t believe that i deserve to get better. has anyone else been in this position and gotten better?",0
"lonely. i am struggling with depression for the past few months. it gets harder and harder to function and to keep believing that this will ever get better. last week my partner broke up with me, not only because of my depression but i'm sure it played a significant role. i'm in free fall. i just can't anymore. i still want to fight to get better and i will finally start medication next week, i hope it will help. but without my partner by my side it feels all so hopeless, i cannot lose my biggest support right now. consiously i know it will get better some day, but it's so hard to keep going when i don't even know how to get through each night, barely being able to sleep. if anyone has encouraging words i would be very grateful.",0
"working on myself but still feel depressed. as the title says, i've been focusing on myself, been trying to fill out the gaps in my time with something productive, i got good things going on in my life but i still feel kinda depressed at the end of the day kinda weird isn't it supposed to be the other way around?",0
"everything feels weird. i'm in a mental pit that feels like it should be a puddle.. like, i don't even feel sad anymore, it's just this perpetual state of total apathy. i'm functional, mostly, but it's like being stuck in one spot, even though rationally, you should be able to leave any time. whenever my anxiety acts up with ""what if i fail this??? what if i don't get accepted at uni??"" or whatever, my instant first thought is always ""well, i can always kill myself and be done with it."" even though i actually don't want to die at the moment. i'm terrified of dying accidentally or deliberately, simply because of how much i know it would hurt my family. my mother already died, and i'm really close with my sister, so i think it'd hit her and dad the hardest. i don't feel sad, but i don't feel happy either. there are some videos or games that make me laugh or smile, but only for a bit, yet that's enough to make me feel like i'm faking it all. i was considering sh again, because i know that would make me feel something new at least, but my sober streak is keeping me from doing it thank the gods . i want therapy and meds if i can get them, but right now the mere thought of having to talk to another therapist makes me nauseous. having to find one and scheduling a first appointment already seems like an impossibly hard leap. any advice on how to feel less like a corpse in a living body?",0
i'd rather feel fear. two men clearly on drugs were walking in front of me on my way to work and i just walked beside them thinking maybe they'll go nuts on me and pull out a knife. they looked at me a few times and turned left as i continued straight on. the thought of them getting paranoid and assaulting me filled me with fear but it made me feel present in the moment.,0

"dishes. i was wondering if any of you have any tips that help you deal with the dishes. i have depression, ptsd and high functioning anxiety. i can bring myself to pick up garbage and throw my laundry in the same mountain in the corner of my bedroom. i dont mind never folding clothes or making my bed. i've come to terms with the depression and anxiety and that this is how i live and get by and what works for me. dishes dont work for me tho. they pile up. i use paper and plastic everything. its much much more manageable for me to just toss the paper dishes and take out trash. but, currently, despite using paper i ran out this month at some point i used every single usable dish in my house apart from my large mixing bowls. i had some dishes i brought to work but i threw them away because buying a new dish is easier to me than washing them. cant remember what its called, maybe an impossible task? it just feels too big to start and the thought of it makes my muscles tense up and i want to cry. its frustrating because i can't just set a timer or watch someone else clean to help myself. i also dont have a dishwasher... the only thing i have found that helps me feel better is dedicating a drying rack jut for dirty dishes so i can keep my sinks empty. makes me feel so so so much better. still dont do the dishes, but for anxiety and depression, it does great things. i am to the point where i almost want to just hire someone to do them. nothing else. just do my dishes. what do you guys do? anyone else deal with this. i know i'm not alone maybe i should just wash one dish a day. thats attainable and not terrifying.",0

"i really struggle with attention, restlessness and concentration. something i've struggled with for as long as i can remember is struggling with paying attention to things and concentration. i mean i will by trying my hardest to listen to someone, but then realise i've zoned out mid sentence and haven't paid attention to anything they've said. i cannot concentrate on tasks at all, i get distracted by anything or something literally nothing, i end up starting loads of tasks at once and struggle to finish any of them no matter how simple. i also really struggle with restlessness and patience. i am always moving, it's physically impossible for me to sit still for more than a moment. all this mixed with the fact i seem to have no short term memory and really struggle to get myself motivated to do any task is making my life difficult. all this started to make me think this was adhd, i fit the profile perfectly and my brain has been like this since i can remember, before i ever started to consider i had depression and anxiety. however i spoke to my doctor today and she says it's side effects of the anxiety as i didn't particularly misbehave as a child. she's recommended i start therapy again, which i'm going to start since this negatively effecting my life, and now i think about it has negatively effected me a lot through my life. is this something else people struggle with depression and anxiety experience? tl:dr i thought i had adhd, but my doctor says it's just my depression and anxiety since i didn't misbehave as a kid.",0

"m 32 looking for advice how to proceed. throwaway account for obvious reasons hi there everyone. i have reached a situation i don't know how to handle any further. some context i am male, 32 years old, live in germany, depressed for many years now with anxiety disorder and social phobia all diagnosed . i am gay, hiv positive in treatment and was always the strange kid everywhere. i also suspect to have adhd which would explain some of my rather subpar social abilities and me jumping between topics from time to time sorry if my post gets inconsistent for you i visited a psychotherapist 4 years ago for about half a year to try and get me back on track. this didn't help much and the meds i got just made no difference or they made the situation worse even after weeks of taking them. after my therapy was ""done"" i drifted a bit not doing much all day. i eventually entered a retraining program to become a tax clerk because it was recommended for me because of my abilities. i successfully ended the retraining and am now an official tax clerk on paper . this was 5 months ago. while in the internship part of the retraining i noticed that i am not only scared around of other people or afraid to look like a fool in front of others, i downright hated it being with people i didn't know much but could tell that they took me for an idiot. it's the way they talk and treat you which makes it obvious and makes me stress even more. they did not burst out or screamed at me when i made mistakes, they just treated me like a toddler with pity in their words. i know i am not perfect and do many small mistakes so they are right to be disappointed. this also showed at the final verbal exam for becoming a tax clerk. i was really nervous and when i got my exam topic i managed to focus a bit and collected some key points in the 1 minutes we got to prepare. but when i stood in front of the committee i just locked up. i managed to spew some words that made a logic sentence which saved me from failing right at the finish line. i could tell the committee was disappointed considering i had some of the best theoretical results of the 5 people they tested that year and they also told me with pity in their words to maybe reconsider my career. i guess you can tell this was the point i just didn't know what to do anymore. i felt, and still do like i am not fitting anywhere. to add to this i was never good in small talk and always preferred to be by myself so not much of a charmer. i can cooperate with other people and are the last one to get mad at someone. but the more i payed attention to others around me the more i longed to be left alone, the more i hated being with people that are probably just wearing masks telling you you do ok while gossiping behind your back to an extend it would make you cry. i also became pretty bitter over the past few years and honestly can't find a reason to try to get back into society. i am just tired of people. however after 5 months of no income i reached the limit and as it looks i wont be able to pay for my health insurance this month 15th 16th . i still have meds to treat my hiv infection for a few months but if i get sick because of something else there is a good chance i have to carry the costs with an empty bank account. i know i can get a job with my qualifications but i also know i won't last long because i will focus too much on other people cues again, losing the will to do anything just being at 1 stress the moment i wake up from my alarm until the end of the shift. but i also know that i am a burden to my family right now. i talked to my family doctor about getting evaluated from a psychotherapist maybe the same i was at 4 years ago for adhd. i was met with hesitation but i guess in this rural region i live in i am a very rare case. i also talked to my doctor that is responsible for my hiv treatment about my situation because i let slip that i feel physically ok and he kept asking. he proposed that he could get me a appointment in the psychiatric ward of the hospital because he was close with another doctor that worked there.i declined because i didn't wanted to trouble him knowing fully well i fuck this up too in some way and i am also scared of the stationary aspect. i guess that is the story so far. now i might condense the point of this post to one or two direct questions: i know one should never diagnose themselves no matter how much info you gathered but could undiagnosed adhd be the reason i have so much trouble socially? also what is the best place to ask for get help for this in germany?",0

"don't know who else to talk to... hey guys, i'm 21 years old and diagnosed with chronic depression plus some other mental disorders and trauma. i feel like i've been on autopilot my whole life, feel like i haven't enjoyed a single moment and my past seems like a dream that was just gone too fast. i recently got a job but quit after 4 months because it was causing me major breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. before my job i made some art and participated in art fairs where i made some money, and i wanted to go back into that, but my family shows absolutely no support and just wants me to get a ""normal"" job. i've also been feeling terrible lately because i had to quit paxil so i've had bad withdrawal and am now starting prozac so lots of insomnia and suicidal thoughts in general and my mom won't leave me alone about it, saying i'm using pill side effects as an excuse to be lazy. but i don't want to be lazy or not do nothing all day i hate that, i wanna create art but it's so hard rn but every time i'm just sitting around she makes really hurtful comments and it brings me down even more. i can't stop thinking about suicide and how much better it would be to not exist and not bother anyone and not take any space. i usually talk to my boyfriend about this kind of stuff but he's been so busy with his job and his own mental health issues i don't wanna bring him down with my stuff... if anyone has any advice or just wants to talk in the comments feel free to.",0

why am i not dead yet?. i l've been laying in bed for the past month i think. i can't really remember how long i've been doing this. all i know now is that it has been some time since any social stuff. the last time i went anywhere was to a party where i drank almost a whole bottle of vodka and cried like a bitch about wanting to die and passed out. so the million dollar question is why the fuck am i not dead? where is the nothingnes??,0
"the burdon of homes. there has been this sense of hollowness inside me since the time i can remember. i dont know when did i became this sad creature who strives to survive each day, or when was i truely happy. whatever happens around me it doesnt have any effect on me,there was allways something that kept me from enjoying the moment. for a long time i thought that my home was the source of my sadness, it is because im trapoed in this place where life is constant, where there isnt any motion, trapped in the same mundane cycle. but since i have moved out of my house for my higher studies, i have realised that the problem is not with the place butwith the person. i thought moving out would change my life, it could cheer me up, that i could reinvent happieness here. but few weeks after getting here i saw the downfall of my expectations. now iam more miserable than i was, i dont know what to do and feels like my home was a better place than this. at least it had silence and i could curl up in my bed embracing my lonliness.",0

"even the light has shadows. i've been dealing with depression most my life like many on here. for a while i was stable in a numb sense. i'd wish for the void like many have and cried over my failings and everything. but in recent years i lost my ability to hide in numbness. to simply exist waiting to die. mostly because i was pushed to move forward in life. and with that came emotions and my lose of stability. since then things are better in a progress with growing up sense but my emotional and mental health's been rocky at best. weekly panic attacks at some points. suicidal and self harm thoughts or actions. a new numbness but a worse more dangerous kind.. not a wait for the void but a piece of that void. and it's getting hard to stay focused on the good. my life's better then ever i'm more well treated and doing better in every aspect.. but it's still there the darkness and the harsh voices and everything gnawing at me daily.. rumination of horrible thought loops. seeing blood drip down my arms from open wounds. imagining gashing myself in dangerous ways. they may not always speak or always be felt but they linger, they lie in wait. waiting for me to slip up enough that they become real. that i believe the voices to strong or make the pain real. it's draining.. it's like every morning i get a glass of water and fill the tub with water. but every time they find a weak point they slowly drain the tub and with it my force of will and life. how long tell they drain more then i can fill. or empty it and i go into another spiral downward. i barley made it out the last one.. please give me some way to fight. or some way to think about it any technic that can help...",0

"i m in a situation where i m forced to hold back my depression 24 7 and i can t escape or get much help, and it s making me start the slow descent into my 8th major suicidal period in 2 years life story warning 16 amab . i geniunly don t know what to do with my life anymore. i ve thought of everything i ve been able to vanlife, tiny houses, unit sharing, part times, working now i tried but scored a fast food one, lasted a month, then parents shut the search down as i was clearly a failure so yeah and unfortunately, there s just so far i can get with physical cerebral palsy and mental adhd, ocd, bipolar, suspected aspergers; bpd, anger issues disorders, not to mention the same narcissistic, abusive manipulative helicopter parents it s mostly mental abuse now but was physical in the past and other bullying and all i haven t had a sound sleep since age 8 and haven t been able to go outside without a physical tracker i can t rid of, govt. services can t help get manipulated, all that good shit there not to even mention the 5 year long anxiety period when i was 9 14 that my parents refused to help me with. that brings me to now. been essentially a shut in and isolated even at school at all times at 16 years old, and fearing for any future in this country, due to the fact i cannot afford it and i just can t stand my diminishing rights. i ve tried every way to get out, including physically, but that just fails everytime. my friends that saved me from suicide 7 times got blocked in sept. due to suspicious activity and i ve been banned from most socials and lost everyone as a result not to mention physical deaths. but i want to talk about a less distant crisis. lately i have been losing interest in everything. lately i ve been struggling to brush my teeth. my severe depression has arrived right on time, and with school around the corner, i m anxious, nervous and afraid of what is ahead for me. and, my depression has arrived a couple months early. with that comes the tiredness, comes the laziness, comes the oversleeping, comes the fogginess, comes the lack of interest, comes the inability to do chores, comes the no money, comes the no way out of here, comes the fatigue, comes the disconnection from friends, comes the worsening, comes the violence of dreams, comes the school failing, comes the isolation, comes greater familial ignorance, comes the lack of activity, comes the drop in intelligence, comes the unavailability of jobs, comes the worsening of pay, comes the lower intake of food, comes the dangerous anorexia, comes the hopelessness of my situation, comes the suicide ideation, comes the ignorance, comes the preoccupation with death, and then finally comes the note within 8 short months. i m living with ben shapiro and mega terf mother gothel. i hate to bring politics into this but when it comes down to them attacking me day after day for simply existing, then it unfortunately rears its ugly head. my grades are slipping further, my home life has worsened there are fights every day , and any hope for getting out of this country has left the station. i m broke and will continue to be. i m just barely holding on, but i ve noticed a sharper increase in dreams related to death. i have more violent thoughts and urges, and i m increasingly scared of being around other people. my paranoia has only worsened the amount of panic attacks i get. it gets so bad sometimes i can t even talk. i have gotten a lot more socially anxious and isolated, in record time too. i don t even know if i have a future. i m pretty sure my financially abusive mother, whose birthday is tommorow yaaay ruined and mucked it all up for me. a dream scenario is honestly, just living in a apartment, maybe less than 25 sqft in a lively city philly, nyc, portland, whatever , but honestly i ve just accepted not only will i most likely be forced to be homeless unless there s some miracle rent i can score for sub 5 , but i have also accepted the fact that there s a 9 chance of me not getting out of the usa, 5 chance that i end up some miraculously in canada, and the remaining 5 goes to, fuck knows, eastern europe??? either way, it don t look fine in the least for me or any future prospects. social anxiety prevents customer service jobs, i m too stupid and dumb for a mechanical or physically intense job, and some fuck other who knows bullshit excuse to justify almost being on the verge of not being able to work, wich in america, means i end up starving one way or another in any circumstance. i m just too fucking stupid, not to mention dangerous behind the wheel of a car. i have literally zero redeemable qualities , and the immense gaslighting my mother pulls make it somehow negative redeemable qualities. i m extremly fucked up and fucked in life, and i ve known this for a while now, regardless of how i feel about it. there comes a point in time where to you just cannot improve your situation, and for me, my depression just sinks lower and lower. my once a month therapist wishes she could help, but with a dead end future, i ain t getting nowhere in life, at least from the looks of it. even in the slim chance i get on ssi, that won t afford me jack shit. i ve just got to face it, i m stuck in this situation because of a lot of factors i cannot control. i want to comfort in my misery, in my depression, but i want to be somewhere where i can control my environment to make changes necessary. but, right now, i can t. and it seems only, to be getting worse and worse every. single. passing. week. add that on top of a pattern of continuous toxic friendships that more often than not left me with no constant people in my life other than my family, wich, needless to say, never helped me much else either. nothing is holding me back from getting more anxious, hostile, and violent. i can t leave maximum security that is my house, but i can t stay, otherwise i will be driven to suicide ideation like nothing else i ve expierienced before. the government can t do shit, my therapist can t do shit, my familt can t do shit, my friends what i have left can t do shit, reddit can t do shit, and i can t do shit. because i m so afraid of getting caught and dragged back, like last time, and the time before that. but what can i do when i m the family jester and the funnyman, and the day labourer whenever they can use me, else they ll just ignore. i ve saved myself 7 times from suicide, i m trying everything to not make it an 8th, but it s proving extremely difficult.",0

"therapist says they can t help. i ve had a few types of therapy for depression over the years about 15 , including a few rounds of cbt. one therapist i had spoke about herself for long portions of our sessions. one was a student and i think a bit overwhelmed at the time. one time i had 1 sessions where the therapist said nothing; i d simply sit in the room with them and cry for 5 minutes, then repeat the next week. recently i tried hypnotherapy and on our 4th session the hypnotherapist said she couldn t help me because my hopeless world view was too strong. one time i shopped for a therapist who i d get along with well by having lots of intro sessions with different therapists and picking the one i liked the most. after about 15 sessions it was clear we weren t making any kind of progress. it s hard not to see that i must be the problem in at least a couple of these cases but i don t know what else to do. if they give me homework i do it. everything they ask me to do in the sessions, i do it. visualisations, gratitude journaling, regular exercise etc. the main thing that could be a problem is that sometimes i doubt that they can help me. but it s hard to have hope when a you have depression and b you remember failed therapy experiences of the past. can anyone shine a light on why therapy isn t working for me?",0

"advice needed: ldr partner has severe depression and s.a.d.. hello everyone, amp; x2 b; as the title explained, my partner who i'm in a long distance relationship with, they're in the uk, i'm in the us , suffers from severe depression and seasonal affective disorder. we got together in spring and he's warned me for the last couple months that this was coming up. i've always promised him that i'm not going anywhere and that i can handle it, and i haven't had any trouble with these promises. however, he's been sick we're not sure what with for the last week and a half and it's setting off his depression really bad which is understandable. what's troublesome is that he's shared that he's worried he won't be able to shake it before september hits and his s.a.d. starts to kick into overdrive for the next 7 or so months. he's suffered from these conditions throughout his entire life and i've known him for some time before we started our relationship though never this intimately he'd disappear for long stretches of time, now i know why , so i've no reason to doubt that his concerns are valid. my question to you all is fairly simple... what should i do? how can i help and be there for him? he gets agitated if i ask him how he's feeling too often, especially if i pry for details not because he's hiding anything, he just starts feeling like he's at a doctor's or being interrogated by a psychiatrist, which i get 1 , and if i ask him what i can do to help he changes the subject and ignores the question or he tells me that i am helping by doing whatever i happened to be doing at the time lately it's gaming together or watching movies . i know i should rely on his word but he's flat out told me that he's not comfortable asking for help and when he's down like this he doesn't even feel like he's worthy of help or any type of positivity.. so yeah, any advice on how to possibly help him feel more at ease during his darker times would be appreciated. i really care about him so i'd appreciate advice that is productive to the relationship's longevity, please. thank you ",0

"booked a trip for 18 days and just know i'm going to be miserable. i don't have anyone to travel with. i end up having to do most things by myself. i have only been out of the country once and decided to try to do a trip to a few different cities across europe. i'm regretting it all now. it's too much, i'm going to be gone 18 days but i have no one with me at any point. i'm sure i will meet someone to talk to here or there but no one to share these memories with long term. i don't even have anyone to call and send picture to, to talk to and talk about my day. i'm just alone. i'm really regretting this. i feel so overwhelmed doing this on my own and knowing that it's going to be all on my own i don't want to go. im having really bad thoughts on top of it. my best friend stopped talking to me again. they need space to figure out their life but told me that they don't know when they'll be able to talk to me, most likely when they get a more stable living situation but that's at least december. i can't even talk to my best friend about any of this anymore. i tried ending my life a few years ago and the longer.life continues to be this lonely, the more i regret not just ending it all. i haven't been in contact with my best friend for a long time now. we stopped speaking for over a year. they were going through a crisis and that is kind of why we spoke again. their life seems to be getting better. they're interviewing for an incredible job, and even if not they're making great money. why do they need me anymore? they need to figure out life but they have a lot of good going for them and i know if i'm in their life i'll fuck it up. anytime i'm in their life it tends to go south for them. just like this time when they spoke to me, their life fell apart right when we spoke. maybe it's better if i don't exist so i can't hurt anyone anymore. i only seen to be a burden on people's lives. i'm.tired of being so pathetic.",0
"i'm in immense pain, i'm at a loss for hope, and i'm very tired.. i feel completely hopeless. i remember being a sober, promising new talent. everyone was behind me and i felt invincible. then i went through shit that no person should ever have to, and then started to recall things that happened to me as a kid, and then started to be seriously affected by those experiences and developed ptsd pretty bad. i still can't be around fireworks, and backfires set me off. i wound up starting a career path that i had wanted since i was a kid and it means nothing to me now. i'm a functional drug addict and i'm stuck working 12 hour shifts at my lab, then i go work another 4 programming a lims system for my lab which i may or may not even be paid for. any free time i get, i'm either not doing illegal shit or using what came of that to escape reality. i'm working my life away, i'm haunted by people i care, and i nearly being murdered, and then having to go on to be the fixer to save everyone. as soon as everyone was safe and the situation was settled, most of my friends were gone. i travelled to see what i learned were distant qanon crazed family members. they accused me of being some drug lord and forcibly hospitalized me after being invited to simply come over to visit. they said they were helping me get away from my family who they more or less described as the sopranos. while hospitalized, i was stripped by cops in front of a crowded waiting room, locked away and when i asked for anxiety medication to take the edge off while they were attempting to find a legal reason to hold me, they gave me an anti psychotic. that combined with my add dropped my dopamine levels to essentially . i for the first time in my life honestly felt suicidal the minute it kicked in. i sat locked in a solitary confinement cell in a psych ward for 1 hours listening to the sounds of violent mentally ill people screaming things like how as soon as the door was opened she'd cut our heads off and rip our intestines out. eventually when they concluded my health was fine, i had no drugs in my system, was not mentally ill, and i had zero risk of suicide they begrudgingly let me go onto the street of a town i didn't know 1 miles from home. thankfully my ""mafia"" family had heard of what happened and were already in town to bring me home. they all have there own problems though so there weren't many chances to speak of my experience outside of what was said, how audacious the betrayal was, and trying to sort out if they were going to lie to police and attempt to get out house raided by cops. to this day i've only ever even spoke of this to like 1 person who was in no position to be supportive. i got out of not illegal activities and continued chasing my dreams of becoming a scientific researcher, but was yet again cut down when i had to get someone i cared about off drugs before they self destructed. months later, holding down my first lab job and saving her, i was let go after being abused on the job. they threatened to fire me for obscure, unexplainable reasons so i took notes on exactly what i did throughout the day. when they tried to fire me for not doing enough, they then shifted to it being about me ""wasting time taking notes"" while he tried to hold back a guilty grin. it was the day before all these extravagant benefits he promised would have kicked in too. i was pushed back into selling baked goods and quickly started consuming as well. after many months of learning to program and nearly giving up on my career dreams, i finally got a break at new lab. a few months into that and things with my girl get worse and worse until she ultimately attempted to poison herself and jumped off a bridge. she was in a coma for a few days, but thankfully woke up. now i sit here, high on, well tbh i couldn't realistically tell you what drugs are in my system because i just reach for it like someone would reach for a coffee as long as im not on the job. i've been priced out of my entire state. i'm probably going to have to leave my family and go who knows where. i might have to go back to not illegal activities to simply afford to live in poverty. i've already lost a lot of weight from starvation. my girl's sister said i looked like a pow. honestly i feel completely hopeless. i don't want to be sober because all it is anymore is pain. physical pain from 16 hour work days, and mental pain from running into everyone elses burning buildings to save them, while going home to my own burning building. the difference is nobody is coming to save me. i kinda just want to die and finally have peace.

"i wish i wasn't the problem. even tho i know i will end up alone, like always, and unhappy i keep trying to make things better. i stand up for myself, i work out, drink water, try to be more social, go out for walks, play with animals, volounteer etc. it always fail. i suck at socialising. don't even get me started with that. i hurt my ankle and after i'm healed i've already lost the motivation to go to the gym, i barely get myself up in the morning. one bad day of eating can cause me to lose motivation and eat more than i should and unhealthier for months. i start projects and never finish them. i have no friends. if i were to want to go out with someone , i wouldn't have who to call. there is one girl from class who i hang out a decent amount in school and she's nice so probably she would say yes. randomly during the day i'd realise how i'm completely alone, useless, unmotivated, underaverage and lose all motivation i have. i just don't want to struggle like this for 5 more years. i can't sleep often from overthinking. i feel pathetic that the only thing i look forward in life are video game events, some shows, books and manga. i feel even worse when a story in game makes me feel so many emotions happy or sad , more than i ever felt by something in real life. i used to be very happy about vacations and holidays and i'd be the driving force for organising stuff for them in our home. for about a year and so i just felt..indiffirent. because of that everything was half assed and done literally day before. the only nice thing about them were gifts and food. i always feel either indiffirent or sad. i just don't want this to be my entire life.. i want to change, but i don't know how, or if it's even worth to try. it's a fact that there are people who live to be 7 and never had a friend or a partner. what if i'm one of those people, just at the start of my ""journey"" and not at the end..? amp; x2 b;",0

"a night i can t forget. this happened years ago but it sticks with me and it still plays in my head in the most vivid detail. the years was 2 7 and i was 18 years old living in a small rural town. i had just gotten off work just before 11pm. i was headed to a friends house who was having a party. i decided to take some backroads just so i could relax and unwind bit before i got there. one of the roads i took was infamous for speeding because it has many steep hills, known by some as rollercoaster road. it s a typical country road with no yellow lines and just barely wide enough to accommodate two cars going in opposite directions. i was on that road for 15 seconds before i noticed a strange orange glow illuminating the night sky. when i came up to the top of the hill i was on, i saw a small car completely engulfed in flames sideways blocking the road. i parked on the roadside about 6 ft from the car. i stepped out and was immediately hit with an extreme heat. in movies, people could be close to something like that. i learned what hollywood magic was in that moment. i called 911 and got out to see if anyone needed help. while outside of my vehicle, i could hear screams. the likes of which i haven t heard before or since. nobody knows what there reactions will be in any situation. i took an opened bottle of water, doused myself and ran towards the car, as i got closer i began to hear the screams from the opposite side. inside the car, there were two occupants. obviously deceased. i made my way around the car. on the other side is where i saw an early 9 s f25 slid off the road in a barbed wire fence. numerous people injured. two other occupants from the car that had made it out. i knew them. they were injured, but not life threatening. i learned the truck was traveling the opposite direction as the car. the car was speeding down the road. went off the pavement, over corrected, slid sideways and was t boned by the truck. i heard a woman screaming she couldn t find her kids. they were in the bed of the truck before the accident. the kids were thrown from the truck and had landed quite far away in the grass on the roadside. lifeless little bodies. emergency vehicles began swarming. i ran back to the guy i knew. he kept trying to crawl to the car. screaming the other occupants names. i had to help the paramedics hold him and calm him while they gave him meds to make him less resistant. soon thereafter, a tow truck operator showed up. a close friend of mine s father. i waited with him for the fire to be put out. once it was safe to approach the vehicle, i went with him. not really thinking, just telling what i d seen and knew about this accident to this point. once by the car, you could see the remains. the horrid smell of burnt fuel and human flesh. a sight that s seared into my eyes as well as my memory. i left. went home. no party for me. i took something to help me sleep and woke up the next day. i had texts from many friends informing me that one of my best friends little brothers was killed in an accident last night after leaving a party on a beer run. naive me thought that there were just a lot of accidents that night. no. only one. the charred remains of the front passenger that i saw belonged to my friend. i didn t even know it. i m thankful for that. other people my age learned i was there. everyone had a hundred questions about it. i couldn t sleep for weeks. the sounds of a mother panicking over her children, the screams of a friend that just watched our mutual friends burn, the smells that can t be forgotten. i tried talking to my guy friends but when real emotions began to show, i got the be a man stuff. female friends were even less help. feeling alone, isolated, guilt over not being able to help the kids stacked up and i purposely od d. it s a miracle i m alive today. a lifelong female friend came by to check on me randomly and called 911 when i didn t answer my phone or door. my life changed that night as did many others. i m still here and battle the depression daily.",0

"i don t know if i m over reacting over a bird or not.. so i know many people are scared of pigeons, crows, etc , but i m not. so i was really excited when my mom said she brought a pigeon home today and it s in a bag outside our home. my brothers didn t let her bring it in because it s understandable why and they re also germaphobes. she brought the pigeon home because she saw it just sitting in the middle of the road and many cars nearly ran over it. being the super religious buddhist that she is, she pulled over and brought it home. we had plans to nurse the pigeon back to health. i was really excited i gave it a nickname pipi the pigeon and wanted to secretly bring it into my room. while my mother went to get some stuff, i sat alone with the pigeon and watched it s breathing. i remember thinking wondering to myself if it was breathing so hard because it was going to die soon. after cleaning it s wound, we tried to give it some water and rice. it drank some water but wouldn t eat the rice. my mom left to run some errands and i went to watch to watch some tv. i found some sunflower seeds and went out to give it to the pigeon, but i was shocked to see that it had died. i really didn t expect it to die under my care , even though i didn t do much besides cleaning it s wound and offering some food and water. i ve chosen fish at the counter and watched videos of people killing chickens for food. i live in asia so i ve seen pig heads in butcher stores and whole birds in the display glass for roast meat stores. but when i saw the pigeon lying there so lifeless and limp yet stiff, i couldn t help but cry. i feel so sorry and so much regret that i didn t come out to check on the pigeon more frequently. my mother seems ok now but i m still really bothered by it. i really had hopes that the pigeon would be ok after a few days. am i overreacting again? my depression has gotten slightly better over the last 3 months with a few incidents here and there. i haven t been able to stop feeling sorry for the pigeon for the last few hours. thank you for reading. my asian parents don t understand emotions and my friends don t understand what it s like to be depressed too, so i don t have anyone that i can talk to when i m down.",0
"i want to disappear for a bit. so i'm a 23m living with depression my whole life. i have taken steps to improve my depression and anxiety. for about half a year i was in a polyamorous relationship with my gf of 5 years and a girl i met online. it was hard to come to terms with what i was doing, even hiding it from family which caused strain. but i fell for her and the whole relationship. but a month ago she broke up with us because she wanted to work on herself and figure out what she wanted. this decision was after a week of her deciding what to do because another person kissed her and asked her out, it was hidden from me for a week before that. she promised to still be friends, but hasn't talked to me for a month because she doesn't want to hurt anybody anymore, yet i see that she is still hanging out with the other person. i wouldn't care, but she said she was going to take their time away from them to work on herself. it hurts because i still care, and i feel like i'm the only one that does. she even messages my girlfriend from time to time. now my gf and i are taking a break, so we both can work on ourselves. this month has been tough with one bad thing happening after another. i'm in therapy now, and talked to a psychologist for his opinion on better med options and boosters. the thing that shocks me is that he said i'm on the cusp of developing borderline personality disorder. i don't know what to do anymore. i'm sticking with these things but i feel too far gone. i can't stop worrying and being the most unhappy i've ever been. i have lost all my appetite, and just can't talk to anyone because i'm tired of leaning on people, and tired of just being told to move on. i'm in a place where i want to disappear for a few days. i bought what i need to live and work in my car, i just want to drive far away and sleep in my car and tell no one, then just come back early next week. i feel like i need to do this, but i know it's not me saying that. what should i do, or what can help me?",0

"i feel like i'm a failure nonstop, which makes me depressed. hey i feel like i need to speak up and lift the heaviness of my thoughts off my shoulders. i am 22, living in a caucasian country with strict requirements from males; they must be strong, don't show emotions, and be true leaders. if they see even the smallest sign of mistreatment, they must fight immediately. well, i don't fit in this category. i don't have an experience of such things. a calm person by nature, i would rather talk things out than fight over them. my father has never supported me in any way. we live in the same house, but we never speak to each other. i basically have no support except for my mother and sister. in recent weeks, the thought of me as an adult has crept into my head: i need to take responsibility for my family, i need to protect my sister; i need to behave more mature and more like a real man. however, no one showed me how to do that. i've never been in a fight and am unsure if i will be able to protect my closest ones if needed. i always escape from taking on any sort of responsibilities because i am sure that i'll fail them. and the meeting of these 2 thoughts of me being an adult and not knowing how to behave properly make me really depressed. it's already a week that every time i try to do something, the thought of me being helpless and sort of a loser doesn't let me finish anything. i also have very severe social anxiety on top of this, so i feel like i am letting my family down by not being a good support system for them. i feel like a real failure. i just really need a male role model in my life to rely on, but there is no one. my father is not interested in our family, and i have no brothers. only friends with whom i will feel very ashamed to talk about this. i was always aware of the type of my personality, but i don't know why my mind focused on my disadvantages for the past week literally non stop. not sure if anyone felt the same, but any response would be very appreciated.",0

"weird thing to be depressed about. over the years ive been depressed on and off about certain things but this one thing that happened recently has been affecting me to a level that i did not expect. it honestly embarassing to talk about because its so little in comparison to the major things that can happen to people that can affect them. a couple months ago i got burned on my body and it left a mark about the size of a dime. that shouldnt be much of a big deal but for some reason the look of it just really disturbs me. to the point where im even suprised that its bothering me this much. its iust this ugly dark purple black color that just looks terrible to me and makes me feel so uncomfortable with my body. it feels dissapointing because just when i was starting to get comfortable with my self and relaxed this happens and makes me feel constant self concious tension that is lingering that i can never seem to ease. im hoping it fades away but if it doesnt im really seeking help on how to psychologically process and view this so it no longer bothers me. i know its most likely not normal to be this disturbed by something as miniscule, and i recognize that but it doesnt change the way i feel. i really need some advice on a perspective i could take that will make me stop having these feelings",0

"got my drivers license today and don t feel any better. maybe it s because it happened so unexpectedly quickly today, rather than it happening after having to wait until after lunch. i was surprisingly able to just walk in and get it done right away. or maybe it s because i had immediately made a poor decision after getting my license, where i pulled out in front of someone when it was the better decision to wait, due to my nerves still all over the place i guess. i feel so much guilt and embarrassment when i make any mistake. especially in front of my mom who has a lot of anxiety sometimes. i didn t back up perfectly straight either during the test, which made me feel embarrassed. i can care so much and so little about anything sometimes. i m 18 and have struggled with driving for a while, so this should be a big accomplishment, but i just feel the way i always do. i know i shouldn t be surprised. i just want to sleep really. all it means is that i will now need to get a job that somehow allows me to avoid my emotionally abusive ex i m still terrified of, and i m sure the completion of that will feel even less accomplishing than this. it all is what it is, it s just life. constantly stressing over productivity when productivity means nothing to me. it s just doing what others expect. i dunno why i feel so down",0

"11yo foster daughter is showing signs of clinical depression. we are foster parents. we just received a placement two weeks ago for two sisters 11 and 15. the 11 year old is really struggling hard. obviously, any reason why a kid would end up in foster care is sad and terrible. situational depression is very common and i'm used to dealing with very sad kids. however, last night, in tears she started opening up about feeling sad all the time. and as she cried and talked, i realized that we were probably dealing with something else besides situational depression. she described being sad, even when good things are happening. she talked about how at school, she is always anxious and hates being in groups. sometimes she will go cry in the bathroom and gets bullied on the regular. it also seems like, because she is so emotional, the teachers don't take her very seriously and disregard her when she feels bullied. and she mentioned having felt suicidal in the past, but that she liked being alive, she just hates feeling so sad all the time.

""why can't i ever feel happy?"" there are also additional trauma related issues that we are seeing that are concerning as well. the soonest appointment i can get for this kid is august 17 and it's just a preliminary visit to set up mental health services. i've already been warned that the wait for a therapist is months away. what do i do in the meantime? how do i help? i'm really good at advocating for my foster kids so i'm wondering if i need to push harder to get her therapy sooner. obviously, these are all red flags, but in foster care, most of the kids are dealing with mental health issues so getting cps dss to move faster is very difficult. is there anything i can do to help as a parent, as i wait for therapy to start? any tips?",0
"is therapy worth it?. is therapy actually worth the time money? as guessed, i have never been to a therapist before, but i have come to this point where im really thinking about it. im a guy in his mid 2 s. and i diognised my self with depression. i have been sad a long time. but its been really bad this last few months. im at this point where i feel like i am without emotions. and even started to think about how it would be better if i just gave up. this may i had a relaps of an medical issue i thought i was done with, and its been really hard to fake a smile, or pretend to be okay after it happened. would a therapy be a solution? or should i just give it time? thanks for your reply ",0
"not worth it. i can't fucking take it anymore. every single day some fresh hell is presented to me. i have had migraines since i was a teenager, the last 5 years i haven't been able to get into a neuro in order to get help. my teeth are rotting in my head causing said migraines to be worse. i've had covid twice this year, which made my migraines worse and am getting ready to lose my job as a result. i have lost every job i've had due to my migraines. i can't afford insurance due to missing so many hours at work, can't get it via my employer because i'm a contractor. my wife can't add me to her insurance because her employer doesn't cover spouses. now i just found out we being sued by a hospital my wife had emergency gallbladder surgery at. we never received any bills from that until we got a civil summons. we absolutely cannot afford this. i am beyond my ability to cope with this. no one can help, we don't qualify for any government assistance. we both with full time jobs and take care if our autistic son. that's literally all i do and i have no fight left in me. i'm sitting in the bathroom at work crying, afraid someone is going to hear me. i don't want to do this anymore, things are supposed to get better if you work hard. but the harder i work the worse things get. it's only a matter of time till we're homeless and i can't do it. my family lived in a car for a while as a kid and it was one of the worse experiences of my life, and i'm getting ready to put my family through it even though i've done everything right.",0
i think i'm too hard on myself. so i'll be 19 in february and i think i have really high expectations of what a 19 year old person should be doing no matter what i feel like a loser like i'm not worthy of my parents money growing up i used to be the smart kid everyone thought i'll do great things but since i've became depressed i started being a disappointment to myself and everyone else i now go through tik tok and be depressed and angry all the time i rarely go out i have no friends no dreams ntg i just wish to die and disappear i hate that i didn't turn out like my parents wanted,0
"i m depressed because i m gay but not out. i feel like i ll be single forever, i don t even know where to go or who to talk to. sometimes i feel like, am i depressed because i m gay or being gay is just naturally depressing? how many times i wish i was straight, act straight, look straight, maybe things will be different. but people say gay or not, we re all suffering from loneliness. i usually function properly in the morning, but when it s time for bed, everything suddenly rushes back into my brain all at once. i ll think about the future, what is life about, what happens if i die, etc. then i couldn t sleep. i just randomly nap a few minutes at a time until it s morning. am i alone in this?",0
trying to keep spirits up...failing at it. i got laid off. can't find a job that will at least pay my rent. my friend died on friday. i tried reaching out to talk to people but no one responds i rarely reach out to people because i don't want to burden them . my thoughts are getting really dark regarding myself. with every new thing that is going wrong in the world i am too afraid to even go out small distances. i do go to church but that is it. it is really hard to keep your head up when so many things are going wrong. i don't want to die but everything is so sad and i can't seem to pull myself up.,0

anxiety and depression. i ve 22f been on autopilot for years now it feels like. i graduated college this year and got my first full time job within days of graduating. i work at a residential treatment center for adolescents and it s been so emotionally and mentally draining and exhausting. it s been three months and i m still nervous to go to work and go home at midnight from my shift thinking of all the messed up things i saw. i ve had depression since i was 15 and always been anxious. my boyfriend and i are an hour apart and he works opposite hours than me. life has just been rough and i ve been feeling disconnected from myself and from my spirituality. my tarot cards remind me i m on a healing journey but i m so tired and self destructive at the same time and hate the place i m in that i m ready for a change but i m so disconnected. i need some inspiration i go in circles all the time. i want be more in tune with myself and need more advice than just to meditate because i like having options.,0
"i got everything i ever wanted.. for a long time now i wanted a lot of things that i used to not have. friends. success. love. social adeptness. i grew up as a loser throughout school, spending most of my time gaming and as an outcast. eventually i discovered the world outside of computers. parties, friends, love, the outdoors and the gym. but all the years of lack of self care made it so that it took me a lot of effort and time to get to where i am today. today, i'm well on my way to my dream career. i'm super fit. i have great style. i have an easy time with girls. people i meet think i'm cool. i get invited out to parties on a daily basis. people respect the person i am now. i'm proud of the person i've become. but it doesn't make me happy. i don't want more. i just want to be happy. and i'm not. i don't really want any solutions from you guys, i don't want help or pity or to hear you're in the same boat. i just wanted to rant to people who i won't and don't know. this year i got everything i always wanted. and i always thought when i got everything i wanted, i'd be happy. but i don't feel happy. i just feel nothing as always.",0

"excuses not to drink?. hey guys, little help here. i'm starting therapy with antidepressants and therefore won't be able to drink anymore. since this is kind of a private thing that i'd rather not share with anyone, what's a good excuse not to drink apart from antidepressants? like antibiotics for a non serious disease or smth? i know that i could just say i don't drink out of health concerns, but i used to drink pretty regularly before living in germany lol , so i don't want anyone to worry or smth",0
"mental illness obsession. is it weird that i am obsessed with and find comfort in depression. it makes me feel otherworldly. i know that doesn t make sense but sometimes when i m depressed i like to isolate myself in small closets with doors, in the dark. it makes me dissociate and look out of the cracks of the closet at my room and watch myself rot away on my bed,and i like that. when i m depressed i m not worried about anything, i don t cry anymore. i feel hollow and empty. but that s better than feeling anxious and nervous. i try and make myself sadder by forcing myself to think about my trauma? i beat down on myself, i cut myself because it makes me feel like i have no purpose. i enjoy making myself sad, because if i m not depressed and sad and lonely than what am i?",0
"the worst part of depression for me.. personally, the worst part is knowing that i in fact do have the power to change my mind and my habits, but completely lacking the energy to do it. depression has entirely robbed me of the ability to make the necessary changes to get over it. i feel like there is a creature living inside me that knows i can kick it out at any time. and i should, because it lives off my misery and self hatred. so it takes all the energy i could use to get rid of it, and turns it into impotent anger that has nowhere to go except deeper inside. and i feel worse. i feel lazy. i feel helpless and pathetic, because i can't do the most basic things an adult should be able to do. i can't help myself. i can't even get outside to find someone to help me help myself. everything that i can think of to point out a reason why i can't is just an excuse. a lie i tell myself to hide from the fact that i'm just lazy, pathetic, and helpless. i should have been put out of the world's misery years ago, because all i am is a drain on their resources. i am a parasite. i don't have the energy to help myself, and so i leech off my friends and family and give nothing back. i hate living like this.",0

"can i have depression if i don t feel like i have depression?. i have struggled with both anxiety and depression in the past. at this point in my life, i am actually feeling pretty good overall, and am currently not on any medication for anxiety and depression. having had it, and done a lot of research in the past, i know the signs of depression. i have noticed several of those signs lately, and i am wondering, even if i am aware of my current feelings, and know how i have felt in the past when i was suffering from depression, and know that i am not feeling that way now, could i actually have depression right now? or are these depression signs i ve noticed just coincidental changes i am going through, gradual lifestyle changes, or whatever, that happen as people age and grow? some of the signs i have noticed lately include a lessening of body hygiene standards, a lack of interest in some of my formerly favorite hobbies, as well as sex, and romantic relationships altogether, less of a drive to pursue achieve life goals. again, if i saw these signs in someone i know, i would definitely think that they were experiencing symptoms of depression. but i honestly feel pretty good overall these days. could i actually have depression, without feeling like i do? thanks.",0
"my heart and soul are giving up. the past years i have learned so much about myself, much about what i don t understand, mostly with what i love, what i hate, what i like, what i dislike. i ve always been a girl with a heavy soul, bringing a heavy baggage wherever i go. i learned that i will never be happy until i accept what happiness means to me. in my world, however, that s slim. i learned wherever i go, home or outside of home, i will never find what fulfills my soul. i always end up losing myself. moments where i thought i had it, moments i thought, this is it. but for some reason, i already know what ll happen with my future in that circumstance. it s like having a deju vu a year later, as if i have been in that position. trust me i know, i have tried many times to fix myself. i couldn t. i don t know really what people think of me. i ll just go with the obvious she s too dumb to do anything with her life i can see it i played myself dumb in front of people, i played this characters people wish of me to be; only to downplay and self sabotage. i love being in pain because i m a masochist. but no one truly knows my heart amp; how deeply i feel for people. i wanted peace i couldn t have. i wanted love, seems like i couldn t understand, i wanted a friend, seems like i couldn t trust. i wanted a family, seems like an unlucky daughter to have. i wanted a career, which seems like something i couldn t reach. i wanted to dream, seems like i couldn t achieve. and the list takes you into an endless loop of self depreciation amp; despair. cheers. i'll just sulk here and try not to breathe.",0

"i 17 m have fallen down too early.... at a such young age, i went from a normal teenager to the most depressed student in my high school. literally, i am the only student in the class that sits alone. not that my classmates don't like me as some have tried to show sympathy to me but after many of my mental breakdowns and holding of the tears out of fear that i would be called ""weak, foolish, retarded"", i have reached the point of no return and no escape from the darkness. i was not bullied in elementary school or high school, i don't know whether should i attribute my blame to the parents who have ""forced me to control my anger"" knowing that it is not the correct answer to dealing with your inside problems because it would only be worse. i do admit that my parents are not good at helping me understand life except when they refer that life is never balanced which is true. i even failed to fulfill the goal to keep in contact with my classmates because none would have ""free time"" to hang out with me even if it is summer break. i want to treat them with good respect because in the end that would be returned, right? well even if i tried, none would feel like it. what is the point to live a life if you fall down through an open manhole at a young age and realize you could be stuck there forever? even typing these things feels like i only have negative energy. i am a self doubtful person and whenever they say it will be better, it will not be better if i can't make any of my own progress. i don't want to end up in a unhealthy relationship by stealing the positive energy from my girlfriend until i have finally achieved my desire. i crave for positive energy which is very hard to obtain these days. i cannot do suicide because i fear of dying. no matter how much this would make me because i will never do it even if i am depressed. i was simply made to suffer an eternity in this purgatory that i was born to. whoever even dares tell me that the teenage years are the happy years does not understand that life is unbalanced and cannot revolve around one person. let me tell you also this. at the end of my school year, the school psychologist promised me to find someone i could truly hang out with from one of my classmates and guess what? she never did she backstabbed me with ""happy propaganda"" just to give me false hope and make me even more miserable. i want to treat people with kindness and virtue, not to be turned down and sent to the bottom of the ""bottomless pit"". never will i ever be able to get out of it and live a happy ever after life like the others would do. i appreciate their every move and i don't feel like being jealous about it, i just wanted to be with them, not be away from them. i don't believe in my own happiness, the happiness itself in general, the confidence to get a girlfriend, the relapsing that will change someone for good, the desire to talk to others because you will vanish quickly. goodbye tl;dr the story of how i became the most depressed and self doubtful student in my high school and why i might accept my defeat.",0

"i feel as if my feelings are not valid. i'm not professionally diagnosed with depression, but i do tend to feel really upset quite a lot. whenever i do feel upset i feel as if i'm being ungrateful. my family loves me and my whole life i've always been told that that's all that matters, but sometimes i feel like family might not be enough. we struggle with money, my friends don't seem to care about me, my mother does sort of get mad too easily and says hurtful things sometimes, and my great grandfather died when i was younger and he was my main source of happiness. those are the main things i get upset about. and i am aware that there are people who have it way worse than me, some people have been abused, some people weren't loved properly by their parents, people have experienced all kinds of stuff. my reasons to be upset feel really small and unimportant, which also makes me feel even more depressed. and this is why i feel i'm being ungrateful, i have amazing parents who care for me very much, but for some reason i'm still sad. i don't understand. i've literally always been told that family is all that matters so why do i still feel like this",0

"too depressed to get out of depression. getting out of depression needs work which i am unable to put effort into. i am seeing a company provided therapist, all she does is to praise me for my good efforts which i think are normal like you know, not doing a reply all when i am upset with a colleague . i am too poor to afford a therapist myself. i want to switch therapist but i also feel bad about it and i wonder if my company will notice me switching. i dislike journaling in a ""single source"" because of privacy reasons there are so many online backdoors nowadays and offline options are not good enough as i don't live alone, i am scared others will read my journal. at least if this one got read by someone i know irl, it is just one page. one entry. i used to have a good psychologist, but she was too expensive and felt i progressed enough to not need her help. i learn from her that i can't be depressed for no reason which is true. i just didn't want to admit the source. today, i am depressed because i made a mistake at work. i may look like i don't care about work on the surface but the truth is i take failings personally, so personally i feel numb and helpless about it. i need some some guidance for this. i feel that there's something wrong with me psychologically to feel defeated by a mistake, which was in good faith. i am also thinking about the past mistakes i think and how it is gonna repeat again... because i didn't want to put in the effort to change. another thing that bothered me is my new psychiatrist. i was supposed to have an appointment with him a few days ago. it was pushed back by a month...and before that i called him asking him for help to top up my insomnia medications but i hasn't been sleeping well and i am suffering from a loss of appetite. he didn't get back to me on meeting me ad hoc. he is a very busy busy doctor i guess. at least my last psychiatrist will squeeze out time for me, staying back a little later so he could see me for 1 minutes when i told him the medication isn't working for me and i want to change back to my old meds. all this little tiny disasters in my life has sap me of my motivation, my energy, my appetite i often skip meals or eat very little and i don't even know what to do now. my depression will kill my career and academic prospects. but i don't know if i can even help myself anymore. i am passively suicide thinking about ending it whenever a tiny disaster came. the fact that my psychiatrist appointment was pushed back by a month bother me. i am trying my best not to take it personally but i can't. i needed help for my insomnia, i asked for it, i had a talk with him, but no help came. my therapist isn't helpful either. just wishing all this will end.",0

"i don't want to come back home after work. what should i do?. i work at night, from 6p.m to 9p.m and i'm living in a rented room with my friend. i have free time in the morning and afternoon, and just have to go to work at night. however, the point is that after work i don't want to go home, not because i hate my friend or something. i get on well with her. i just don't want to go home because i have nothing to expect. once i go home, i need to face with many other problems, such as my house chores, documents at work, the cramped space in my rented room, etc. i feel exhausted and frustrated. when i finish my work, i feel like now i have escaped from it and i just want to do something happy out there but i don't know what i should do. the only thing i do is to wander along the city on my motorbike till midnight, and then go back to my rented room feeling exhausted and disappointed about myself because i waste time doing silly things instead of going back home and doing something useful. i just want to find a motivation to come back home. what should i do? coming back home after work is not a normal thing for me to do anymore. why is it so difficult, why does it require more disciplines than it should : ",0
"bad luck hate my life. all started the bad waves of 3 s i got my dog about 9 weeks ago and it started there. i got ryker, he swallowed his collar on his journey from canada to montana. second week he got iron poisoning from a cuddle toy and the owner was a bitch and didn t care that he had so much iron in his body it looked like a christmas tree. fourth week with him, was the day i got my surgery and it was suppose to be 2 min surgery and 2 days of healing in my knee. turned out to be 3 hours long, and 6 weeks on crutches boot. a day after surgery, i let him off leash in our own area, my neighbor dog mauled him ripped half his tongue in half. now he has a crooked tongue, and 25 later. the other dog owner she is a cunt and so is her stupid fucking dog. i then am taking longer to do shit because no one could help me put on pants, dress myself, or bathe myself. work got upset despite me needing the surgery. i then worked for two years with said company, to renege on their promise to me 2 years ago if i took a shitty paying job, i would get more money. they ended up hiring 4 other people and for the job i was promised, they rehired a guy that went through 11 employees during his 3 years, then walked off the job. during that time he had a chick write rapist in his truck which i guess he thought was hilarious. he then shot a guy at his house in the chest and that s who they hired over me i complained and made it very apparent as that was a horrible move. i was brought in a meeting as i knew they were trying to get rid of me. i documented all of it including recording it. now i may have a wrongful discharge lawsuit. a guy i was suppose to meet canceled on me and said his mom died the exact same time we were suppose to meet. i bought a brand new car and if i knew i would have just been losing it a month after i feet it things would be different. now i have no income. no job. none of crew has messaged me to see if anything is okay. a guy i liked literally over the past four days has went between one extreme another between extreme devaluation and praise. he blew me off again tonight. pretty miserable",0

"could i possibly have some advice?. so i've been severely burnt out from university due to poorly supported adhd, anxiety and depression making it so i never completed enough work to take breaks more than once a month. also partially due to ingrained guilt at not being productive enough 24 7. i've been off school for 3 months now and spend the days trying to be productive or enjoy myself but end up failing to do either causing guilt . days mostly consist of being too tired worsened by meds and uninterested to do much besides lay facedown in bed from 8am to 1am waiting until it's time to sleep. this includes interests like games or writing, and self care like eating or showering which have to be forced after hours of trying to get up. and because of parents, i have to recover from the burnout asap so i can get a job return to school. this created a sort of ticking bomb time limit to recover from the depression enough to be productive and make use of the time off. i considered just forcing myself to get a job, maybe one that causes minimal stress social anxiety, but im unsure if that's condusive to relaxing enough to recover from burnout. any advice? thanks : ",0

"surviving but not living.. this post may be a ramble sorry i m advance. i am 19 years old, and i ve been dealing with mental illness since i was 11. since then, i ve been in cpep countless times, psych wards, residential facilities. after the last long term stay when i was 16 , i thought i was getting better. i ve attempted twice since then, just hospital stays. i ve been in therapy for so long, every 2 weeks. therapy helped me a lot through everything. however, my adolescent therapist had to discharge me from her services august 2 21, as i was getting too old. since then, i ve been trying to find an adult therapist. it s either not accepting patients or super long waitlists and never getting a call. with my psychiatrist, she s a whole story in herself. due to past situations, i have a really hard time trusting anyone, therapists, doctors, etc. i ve only trusted one psychiatrist in my entire life, but he was a fellow and got moved somewhere else. the one i currently have, i despise. as i am on my mother s insurance, she sees who i see. so, she always finds a way to get ahold of her. my psychiatrist never believes a word i tell her. only believes my mom, even though i never gave her consent to speak with her. i don t even live with my mother. i have told my psychiatrist countless times about how i d like to switch my medication, as it makes me feel no emotion at all. i feel like a zombie on this medication, and all she does is add more to the pile i already take. she never changes the one i ask her to change. i took it into my own hands and ended up stopping my medication all together. i have felt better and it s been a lot trying to manage emotions and actually feeling something, it s been a lot. however, she never believes a word i say. example: i tell her i ve been feeling better without the medication. she always asks are you manic when i even sound remotely happy. it makes me feel so i don t even know what word to use. it just feels awful. it feels awful how every time i am actually happy, nobody cares, nobody supports me, and everyone always thinks i m manic and impulsive . my mom acts as if she is some advocate for mental health awareness yet treats me like trash, and my dad caused so much trauma to me in the past. not even the support that is supposed to be for me believes a word i say, because my mom who doesn t live with me told her otherwise. i feel like i m just falling again just dealing with t all. it feels like it never ends. i would get a new psychiatrist, however i ve called almost every place remotely close to my area and they all aren t accepting new patients or have a waitlist. i just feel like i m not living, just surviving. it sucks, i thought i d be thriving at this point however the never ending crap is always there. ugh. if you got this far, thank you. this is more of a throwaway, i know it s rambles. i m sorry",0
"i'm a 17 year old trans guy with severe depression. as the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why i'm even posting here. i have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasn't ready to deal with that. for all those years since it started i've had very bad episodes of being depressed for months, sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself. i started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago, i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now i'm off meds and i'm pretty sure all of you know that's a slow process. today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city, i'm already stressef because firstly i don't have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans. i came out to my mom, stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i haven't told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i don't want to. but if i don't tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 2 3 years, if anyone here is trans i'm sure they know that doesn't feel nice to be closeted just bc you're scared or don't have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on. i also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl, atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me, since i've struggled with that i can't risk losing an only irl friend by coming out. i don't want to be alone at school anymore, been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i don't want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone. last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didn't. i am extremly depressed right now, i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i don't have the strenght for any of this. i rather just pass away, i don't want anyone to worry as i'm not planning anything but i really need some support.",0

nothing. do you ever completely numb. do you ever feel like everything is completely pointless. like even if you were happy it would ultimately mean nothing because literally nothing matters and nothing is real. nothing is real everything has been created and you can t trust your thoughts or feelings or anything because nothing is real. sometimes cutting myself if the only real thing i can trust. the blood and pain is the only thing that i can trust to prove i am still here,0
"scared my life is going to go nowhere.. i'm 26 and i'll be 27 in just over a month. i dropped out of university when i was about 2 because the course i was on was a complete scam online assignment papers simply linking to youtube videos . when i left i had the goal of getting an apprenticeship instead while i worked, i worked at a call centre, mcdonald's and various factories and tried for about 4 or 5 different apprenticeships over 3 or 4 years as i worked, sometimes i got pretty far but othertimes i was turned away almost immediately, one for example i got rejected because i ""didn't write enough"" on my application even though i filled all of the boxes, when it came to the next year and i went to apply again the applications were only available to people who were fresh out of school despite the fact i had a level 3 diploma from college in the field i was applying for. so i was considered overqualified, which is ridiculous. when i hit 24 i realised it was going nowhere and i hated working the awful jobs that i was working in the meantime, so i decided to go back to university but this time i figured i'd take a different path and learn a new skill, that being programming in c , although we actually code in c most of the time. now i'm on my final year and the chances of me getting a job at the end seem very slim, so i'm working on my own project for myself in unity hoping i can produce something that generates enough money that i can support myself. but i feel scared because if it doesn't work out, which it is very likely not to, and i don't get a job at the end, then i'm gonna be back in the same position i was 3 years ago. it doesn't help that i have basically no reason to live, besides the lack of career and absolutely no financial success, i also have no girlfriend and my list of friends is very slim and they're at work all the time anyway since they're about my age and actually have their life together.",0

"my plugs the only one to tell me they love me. https: youtu.be gnxkrp keru i am 33, project manager and senior estimator obviously have tied my identity to my occupation. although thinking about a lifetime doing what i m doing fills me with dread and unease. i am self diagnosed borderline personality disorder. although it can be argued that these undesirable qualities are exacerbated by physical opiate dependency and a rationalized dependence on methamphetamines to counter the sedative of nature of roxys and fentanyl, in order to keep up with work. i ve been somewhat of a disagreeable person unable or unwilling to fit in as long as i can remember. even though i had always found a tight knit group of compatible personalities. it wasn t until i was older that i recognize this disagreeable nature was my resistance and opposition of the status quo. as i am i do not hesitate to voice my disagreement in situations that i ve believe to be wrong. maybe some would argue that my willingness to speak up and out is a good quality to have. and this is not true. already being oddball black sheep, expressing opposition has only allowed me to push away from people or make it easy for people to drift away from me. but it s more than that i have been selfish and living hedonistically since i could make decisions for myself. in middle school i was a different level of self involved and inconsiderate. but after that tumultuous confusing age i have been hyper aware in sensing and perceiving the feelings of those around me. made every effort to always to be considerate and respectful of another person s heart, no games no leading on. it s still true to this day, though i have bore a fair share of unhealed licks to my heart. i never dated just take ones time and space, taking commitments like that seriously, getting into an exclusive, meant i was willing to take a shot for the long haul. because i am choosy i was single and mingling or faithfully committed. but i am the offspring of two narcissists who married because of pregnancy. i found out this year that my aunt has always adored and been proud of my siblings and i. saying we were planted in hostile soil and chaotic storm but managed to grow through becoming beautiful flowers. obviously you can see she did not get along with her sister, my mother. parents went through a gt;1 year divorce settlement process. my mom always thought my dad s just dripping in hidden wealth. but after years of investigatory auditors, you d imagine they d have found it. they still go back to court to make sure her alimony is maxed out. this is relevant because he doesn t work anymore. comes in to sign payroll check, otherwise traveling or golfing. i have a book keeper who does payroll offline and payables. all project management, bidding estimating, business development, billing ar amp; crm is on me. my salary is what i made as an entry level project engineer when i worked for a gc. my raise requests to my boss dad have all been rejected or ignored rather. we re profitable across the board on all projects. and since i returned 2 18 after working for a hotel building gc, i have seen his monthly payouts go from 7k to now between 2 k 4 k. half my mom takes. but it doesn t matter how aggressively i commit to growth and profit, i see none of it. and what ever growth there is, mom is ready to receive. i can t make any real changes in the office. the book keeper is basically extorting her job security from my dad for the numerous occasions of documented toxic and abusive management he s put her through. so she can say she s not going to use quickbooks or anything that can be digestible for those who d replace her. my dad hasn t really spoken to me for about a year now because i have called him out for the toxic passive aggressive guilt tripping or furious outbursts. my brother is beholden to him and has basically cast me out as deplorable. my sister was someone i could always confide in. but i recently fucked that up. she got hired at a much larger company in industry and pretty much started talking down at me telling me i m lazy for not getting a different job. she s got maybe 2 years exp. in industry and it sounds like our family name and personable impression got her the job from how she described the interview. i got so upset and the rapid shift to better than thou that i pointed out to her what i m saying here, minimizing her abilities. sometimes i feel like i m not in the driver seat when i get mad like that and say things i don t believe, mean or that i regret saying. like i just watch it happen shaking my head like, you fucking asshole moron what s wrong with you. i get invitations to discuss offers at least once a week usually over doubling my current salary. but we ve got installation crews in total 25 guys right now. some guys have worked for this company since i was a baby. if i left everything would fall apart and these people with family s who ve spent decades working for this company, then what. i don t know i have it in me to bear abandoning them like that. a lot of a steadily stacking these layers of complications and shit have brought me to the conclusion that if i killed my self i would solve all my problems and would not have to bear the guilt of leaving the company like that. i can t take a break or even detox because if i let my foot off the gas our quality goes down and trust faulters with clients. i don t drive with my seat belt on any more and started adding fentanyl and xanax to my coping mechanisms not both with driving with other people on road just maybe fall asleep and never wake up. i ve pushed everyone away. any friends i had still moved out of state during covid. if i died no one would know until the money needed to come in. yet i go through the morbid through experiment of what would be said at my funeral and i can see private hushed side conversations of what took him so long . whatever generic de escalation catchphrase you d want to think of that might convince me otherwise, just realize if my family won t even talk to me and i m not worth being a friend, if my memories are mine alone and not shared with anyone what really is the point in being alive in my own created personal hell anymore",0

"i'm losing my battle with depression.. good morning. thanks for dropping in and giving this a read. i guess what i would like to open with is the quote ""this moment will pass"" this quote popped up when i googled the title of my post. this quote is supposed to demonstrate the impermenance of the human condition and how things can change. my particular set of pain arises from the fact that i strongly believe my moment has passed. the opportunities i had for the happiness i desired in this world passed me by. or i actively destroyed them. due to my personal background my attachment styles are so fucked. i have zero friends in the town i grew up in and which i am currently living . i was unable to be a good person to my partner of 9 years, and drove them away. ultimately in them they provided the small amount of comfort i could get from other people. i cut off the only ""caregivers"" i had growing up. my mother and my grandfather as without going into detail lay the ground work for anxious avoidant and people pleasing attachment style. these people did things that show a child you don't love them. these people were not caregivers. their patterns of behavior toward me were repeated in the friendships and romantic relationships i had throughout my teens and most of my 2 s. 2 events from my childhood fill me with such terror i literally can't talk about them directly to protect myself. coming to terms with that has been a dark driver for me. leaving my ex is what drove me to therapy and led me to a lot of self discovery. and hence why i am here today. my mind is prone to terrible patterns of fear, pain, and rumination. this pattern would occur even in the ""good times"" stable life with my partner and no critical eye toward the past . things are only becoming more lonely, dark, and hopless. my point of view on where i am in life is quite low. i don't like or respect myself at all. for example because my ex told me i was overweight i began to eat under a thousand calories a day as a way to gain control over myself. like i don't deserve to eat normally due to how unruly and lowly i have been in the past with my eating. and this pattern continues throughout my life at work, school, and with family. what i've done so far to try and get better: moved in with family to reduce financial and personal stress due to being alone regular exercise regular outings with family nearly weekly expensive therapy sessions reading:how to fix a broken heart by guy winch. self compassion kirsten neff. at last a life, the alchemist, how to change your mind, thinking far slow. weightloss dieting to look better creation of many dating profiles and chatting regularly with women via snapchat allowing myself to express repressed emotion by putting sad music on in my car and sobbing everytime i drive to and from work the use of recreational drugs after a nearly 5 8 year hiatus to try and feel something other than sadness reaching out to as many old friends as possible going out on my own if i am unable to find ppl to go out with. so this is where i get to brass tax. i want to live. i want to live the life i think i could have had if i had did things differently five years ago. i want to be a happy person who could show love and respect to someone i think of as my soulmate. the person i am is not that kind sweet man i remember being at 19. i don't like this person i've become. i thought i would lose this battle today but it seems that scheduling self murder can be interrupted by family. if i were to put numbers on it i think i have a 25 chance of suicide within the next 18 months. in my mind i'm suffering in a irreparable state and therefore do not need to continue. my plan is to get a carbon monoxide detector, run a hose from my tailpipe to the car and when the thing says i'm at murder concentrations go take a nap. i know the approximate location i would do it at and am working on a few journals for the express purpose of leaving. i know the people i would call and what details i would give to them before i ditched my phone and left cell service. i want to live. i want to be happy again. please reader if you have made it this far can you just say you see that i'm in pain and show me some empathy. if you want to take it to another level tell me if there is something you think i should do or do differently. i don't want to die. well i do. but i want to be happy. you know what i am saying. one way or another. ""this moment shall pass""",0
i just feel so empty. title says it all. there s no reason for this either my life is going really really good at the moment but lately i ve just been feeling sad for no reason and feeling this emptiness. i can t really describe it but crying myself to sleep every night is getting kind of old. i don t even know how to fix this since it doesn t seem to be caused by anything. sigh.,0

"tw: i am scared. yesterday for the first time, i was wishing i could die. i wished long and hard that a car hits and i die on impact. i am scared, because the pain is so much. i live in poor living conditions..my health is deteriorating. my boyfriend is absent for most of the time. last night i was in tremendous amount of pain to the point i wanted to end my life. i kept calling him, but he never responded. i sobbed and cried for hours, wrote a final goodbye note then just fell asleep out of exhaustion. now it is just a matter of acting on it. i dont want to die..but i dont see a way out anymore. all my hopes and dreams have been shattered. i just feel so alone. no one is in my corner. noone is there to help me through. my friends are either tired of me or i have pushed them away. i keep myself busy with work so i don't think too much. my medication doesn't seem to be working anymore. all i wanted in life was to be loved and cherished. to be accepted for who i am but i guess i got the short end of the stick. i even fear now maybe my bf is cheating on me. why wouldn't he? i am noone special and i have nothing of value to offer. its sad..i have never been hugged, i don't know how it is like to experience the warmth of sleeping next to someone you love. i am just waiting for the moment he says he doesn't want to be with me anymore.",0

"strict and dysfunctional parents alongside asbergers has given my depression. my parents have always been insanely strict , and has affected me socially. from pre school to sixth grade, i went to a small christian school only 8 students in my class and i did not get along with anyone there. my parents constantly compared me negatively to my peers. i was always above intelligence but they made fun of me being socially awkward, even though bruh my whole life i only knew 7 other people. fast forward, went to public middle school, and thrived socially.first time in my life i made friends and actually had my first kiss and made it to third base in 8th grade and was drinking . my parents did not want me dating and was basically living a double life , of frat bro at school and church boy at home. high school, i still had my friend group and made new friends. because of my parents pushing christian values, whatever the fuck that means, they didn't want me to date and even though i had friends that were girls and kissed and all that, i never brought them to my house and avoided getting too close with them. they also started drug testing me junior year and whenever i went which i did once in a blue moon, literally would follow me and smell my breath and i had to be home at 7 pm. i basically had friends only in school and not outside of school, bc after my sophomore year, i stopped going to see them. all the sudden, college , my parents are like you should get married and find a good christian girl.i go to a big public city school , i'm from suburban tx , and my freshman and sophomore year i did fine academically, but the 2 years of rare outside social contact , fucked me up and i had trouble keeping friends. i fell in love with a girl right before covid, who was not christian, she was hindu, and i told my parents. my parents were fine with here but worried about her ""moral values"",but my grandparents, were like ""you coudn't find a white girl?"" . she also really liked to make bracelets and my parents would lose their shit because bracelets on a man look ""gay"". over time, dealing with it ruined me mentally. we ended up breaking up but i wouldn't bring up dating ever again with my parents. the stress that came from the relationship plus covid led me to gain weight and my grades slipped. i still passed but my cumgpa had dropped from a 3.2 to a 2.8 in one year. over the summer,i met a new girl who was east asian and i obviously hid the relationship from my parents. she abused by punching and slapping me, stole from my credit card,and i could not tell my parents cuz they'd be like ""thats what happens when you date someone who doesnt believe in jesus gt;"" i ended up failing all my classes that semester, and when my parents found out they took me out of school. they took my phone and my laptop away and i ended up working at a fed ex warehouse for 4 months. i hated it and my depression got worse, bc every day i would come home to my parents screaming abt how i fucked up my life, and how they can't show their faces at church, bc their kid dropped out of school. i also had no contact with anyone. they would also scream at me for sleeping for so long. in june, i began taking summer online courses, but i'm still working 6 hours a day. i do not have a phone so i still can't contact anyone and especially in compsci, when i'm stuck i can't contact friends to help which is led to my grades suffering. over the past month, i have woken up and have headaches 24 7. since christmas, i have not had any contact with any of my friends and i have begun to talk to myself and i could give a shit abt my appearance so i've gained even more weight. my parents blame me for "" being in outer space and acting weird"" but i have had zero social contact with anyone. they still scream at me every day. lastly , my parents are big on church but they have been screaming at each other since i was 2. i've dealt with hours of screaming matches daily my whole fuckin life, and it's led to me being scared of others and i'm unable to stand up for myself. i want to know how to get better, and right now the biggest thing is the lack of social contact bc i've been going crazier every day.",0

"i just need support or a conversation. i'm 22 years old, she's 23. and now she says she wants to break up.. we've been together for over seven years, three of which have been married. it's been an amazing seven years that i always think back on with a smile. she is my first love, and divorce seemed impossible to me even a month ago. everything seemed so magical. but now divorce is a reality she told me yesterday. on our wedding anniversary. we were married a few years ago. we weren't in a toxic relationship at the time although there was a time when that relationship was, in the beginning , we had matured, and then we started talking about starting a family. it seemed like the right thing to do. our relationship was no different than a normal marriage and we just wanted to secure the result of our growing up. it was a great relationship. it was always built on telling each other the truth and not holding back on problems. on solving crisis situations together. she was my best friend, my lover, and it always seemed so permanent. we may have disagreed on some things, but it was never a problem. it's probably worth starting a little further back. in february of this year, i cracked up. my stepfather died last august from a coronavirus, and after that i had to combine work and study to help my mom with the loans my father had gotten me. my employer was crap. she could call me at 1 a.m. to do completely unnecessary tasks. the pay was crap too, but it was a living wage. at the same time i was in master's degree program. she was at home with her parents, in our hometown, rostov on don. i was in moscow. i was trying to save money to start renting a place to live together. at the same time she was studying for the degree she wanted. it was hard for me, but i felt i could rely on her if i had a tough time. i expected mutual acceptance. she came when i could save up; and it was a few wonderful months in a new place, a new page in my life. we had our problems, but nothing beyond what the average couple goes through. but here i cracked. i dropped out of university, quit my job, and started looking for a new one. while preparing for another interview i realized that i was emotionally exhausted completely. i had an accurate understanding that i was failing at the university. but realizing that i was falling apart and that i looked like a veggie was harder. she left to visit our parents, and i took off after her to my hometown. i was tired of the gray skies of the capital, i wanted sunshine, i wanted to feel alive. i arrived, and it felt like i had been born again. everything around me was so colorful and warm. it was 2 degrees celsius in the south and 5 degrees celsius in the north. and i didn't want to go back. i wanted to recover, i wanted a change of town. i was tired of the frantic rhythm of the metropolis. but my wife had other plans. a job offer came up, and she came back. she had to move out of the apartment, get her things. she did it alone and stayed there. i thought we would go back to rostov on don for a few months, live in our own place, help each other out. she thought i would come back with her and we would work like crazy together, sharing the workload. a couple of months later i came to visit her for her birthday and it was a wonderful weekend. we spent it in a tourist town, not far from moscow, and when i drove back, we agreed to meet for our anniversary and live together again in september. but just a couple of weeks later we started having a serious spat. the whole month of july. she was talking about how i left her alone and chose to run away from my problems. that her birthday weekend was a big handout to me. i said that she chose to be careerist rather than show support in this relationship. that i had completely stopped getting to know the person i was married to. and the sad part is that we had this conversation before and i thought it was a passed story. but it wasn't. a couple of weeks ago she and i had another conversation. she said she would be thinking about getting a divorce. whether we should give this relationship another chance. we didn't talk for a long time. i tried to prepare myself for a negative outcome. still sent a gift on our anniversary. i got nothing in return. and in the evening the words that the gifts served as a nice reminder of our past. and that she had decided to get a divorce. i just feel devastated. i struggle with myself and my emotions, but i feel pathetic. i've been trying to get over it alone, but i can't and i break down into incomprehensible howls and tears. it's like i've been abandoned for being depressed and not being able to ""be strong.""",0

"us and them. i consider this to be the best day of my life the most depressing day of my life. this was close to 5 and a half years ago, and i would like to think i'm over it, but i still dwell on it from time to time. backstory: i had been homeschooled my entire life, but i never thought anything out of the ordinary about it. that was just how my life had always been. i just though it was normal anyways, the day was march 25th, 2 17, and i was just chilling in my room on a cloudy saturday afternoon. it didn't seem like anything was different about that day at first, it was just a normal, boring day. i remember being on skype at the time, and i get a message from my friend's gf at the time asking me if i wanted to go to her school play. i was kind of caught off guard by it since i had never really hung out with friends before outside of them coming over to my house, but i wasn't opposed to the idea at all. it surprised me that someone had asked me to even go to something like that. it made me feel appreciated and important, which was new for me i guess. i remember calling my father to ask him if he could give me a ride later that night to the high school, and he was surprisingly more than happy to drive me. so 6:3 rolls around and we hit the road. my father had put in his dark side of the moon cd, which i had heard bits and pieces of the songs here and there, but never in their entirety. we get to the neighborhood right next to my friend's high school and the intro to the song us and them starts to play. we come over the hill and i start to see the school. the combination of a slow, sad sounding, psychedelic song mixed with arriving at a place that, deep down i feel like i should've been there all along, did something to me in that moment. it almost made me realize something, but i hadn't figured out what that thing was. so my father drops me off and i step inside the highschool. imagine you've been slightly alone the majority of your life, and then walking into a building with hundreds of kids the same age as you. it was a little overwhelming, but it was the first time i had felt normal and important to other kids my age. so i walk in and i find my friend waiting in line for their school play, ""the sound of music."" i had never been out with a friend before, and even though it was just a school play, i ended up enjoying every minute of it. so it's 1 p.m. and my father shows up to take me back home. the car ride was quiet, not that there was anything wrong with that, it just added to the sort of somber yet sentimental atmosphere of that day. we get back home and i hop back onto skype to talk to my friend and his then gf to thank them for inviting me to their school. i remember i was about to get off of the call and saying ""you know i don't know why, but i feel kinda tired and sad right now, but i have no idea why."" after i hung up, i felt like i had been gut punched. my emotions started to swell and i started bawling my eyes out. it hit me. everything that had occurred that day made me realize how much i had missed out on in my life at that point. tl:dr us and them reminds me of the best day of my life.",0

"i'm starting to wonder if i even want to be happy. it's nice to feel happy in those times i do, but when i'm not it feels like there's no point in trying so hard to be happy. it's so draining to keep up a good mood, and it feels like i'm ignoring those questions i don't have an answer to, like what's the point, what am i working towards, why am i doing this if it doesn't bring me any kind of joy? if it takes so much effort to be happy and i get nothing back from the world in return, why should i even bother being happy? i can lift my mood, but i still don't know what the hell it is i'm living for. what good does it do to be happy and productive if none of that work leads towards anything meaningful? i'm so tired of it. the world feels fake. all the things im supposed to want don't mean anything to me. i don't want to die, i just want to feel some kind of gratification, some kind of justification for toiling away endlessly doing obligatory tasks i don't really care about. and i know i'm only 24, i've got my whole life ahead of me blah blah but i've wasted the last 6 years of my life slowly chipping away at a degree to get a job i hate less. but i don't care about that, i don't know what i want, i don't even know if i want to be alive for sure. it hurts because i've done nothing with myself and have no idea how to change that or if it's even worth changing. if this is all there is to life i don't know how the hell i'm going to keep going",0
"feeling more and more like i don't deserve to live.. don't have much to say... i just wanted to get the thought out of my head. i was doing so much better. i've been prioritizing my physical health, which has been helping me mentally, but suddenly in the last 1 2 weeks i've been feeling so awful. had my first panic attack to get since i stopped taking my meds at the end of last year. i had gotten into the habit of taking an anti anxiety pill whenever they struck but today i obviously didn't have them. it was so awful. my bf gave me water and helped me slow my breathing but in the end i just feel bad. i feel bad that he had to see me like that, bad that i am the way i am, just bad......",0
"my hair.. i have depression. because of this it makes in hard for me to even get out of bed most days, let alone focus on my hair. ive recently just switched to my naturally curly hair in march hoping it would make me more confident, it didn t. i feel terrible with curly hair. i dont feel confident. my family doesnt like it either, they say it looks neater and better when i straighten it and i agree. straightening it was so much easier. now with curly hair theres so much product and things you have to do. i dont have the motivation or energy to do my hair. my hair is my biggest insecurity and its definitely not helping my depression. should i begin straightening it again, i think it would help me a lot..

"i can t explain how much it hurts. i work from home and all the emails and phone calls keep piling up. the dishes keep piling up, the laundry, the responsibilities god sometimes i feel like i m going to burst. it drives me crazy to know i m in such a privileged position and can t dig myself out of this motivation less hole. sometimes it feels like there s something more wrong than just depression and anxiety but psychiatrists are so useless. i m just so confused and tired of feeling trapped and stressed.",0
"i would do anything to relive my childhood. it makes my sick to my stomach because of how badly i wish i could go back. there are so many memories, flashbacks, smells, emotions i wish i could relive. i love and miss it so much. between the ages 4 to about 1 . i wish my family still owned the house i grew up in. i miss my room, my yard, and not having a single care in world. i miss living with my siblings and mom. i miss the ones who were once here. i miss having the constant feeling of optimism and big dreams. i miss being happy. i feel like my inner child is so disappointed in my adult self. it s alarming how many times a day i wish i could end my pain. i ve been wondering lately that if i were to end it, if i could relive it in another world and start over. but then i would leave my family in pain in this life. i keep listening to this song by quinn xcii called we don t talk enough and i relate to it so hard. because not only am i starting to shut people out, but the one line that goes and i really hope i don t wake up at 5 wondering why i gave my life away, and if it s too late that line hits me hard because i know that s how i m going to feel. i feel like i ve been so depressed and hated myself so long that it will never get better. i appreciate this thread because it s the one place i feel like i can express my true feelings. so thanks for reading my nonsense.",0
"pain doesn't go away, it just gets passed around.. somebody gets hurt, then they hurt someone else. consciously or subconsciously you take it out on someone else. we should be responsible for our own actions. it still doesn't change things though.",0
"hurt. i struggle so deeply on a daily basis trying to figure how to move on. the pain caused my husband being dishonest and unfaithful cut me to the bone. i ve struggled with trusting people my whole life. when i found out about my husband, i lost all hope in humanity. i know now that i can never fully trust another person. i have never told anyone about what happened, as i can t trust anyone to keep things to themselves. not even family. if we didn t have a life we built together i would ve left immediately and continue my life entirely alone. most people think loyalty and respect comes with love, but in so many causes that is just not true. being lonely and hurting by myself is just so well painful. i don t know how to move on or even really won t to anymore. i rather pass, as it seems to be the only way to quite the mind. i don t know if this will reach anyone, i don t know if you will read this and even care. i hope your life is full and you don t feel the sting of another. don t ask for someone s love, ask for loyalty and respect first. no relationship is strong without those two things.",0

"today i really wanted to end it. today was on of those days. i am 4 and have depression since i am a child. i have ptsd due to abused i suffer from my childhood. i am medicated but it stop working after a few days. my shrink is really nice and try really hard to find something that works on me but he is starting to say that i am part of the 2 who's no medication works. i see depression like a little monkey with cymbals. you know like the one you rewind and it starts hitting the cymbals and make a horrific noise. my everyday goal is not to find the monkey. but the sucker looks at me with his smile, like saying you won't make it. but i fight. i try to do stuff. getting dress is like climbing everest, but i do my best to do it. but today was one of the day where the monkey won. it was a horrific day. i woke up early tried to do stuff while listening to podcasts. but the monkey didn't stop saying that the people i was listening to are living a life and that i don't have one. so the monkey started to compare me to people on the podcast. "" at this age he did that, what did you do"" or when they talk about a period of time, like 1 years ago for exemple the monkey tells me "" you were 3 at that time, it was yesterday and years ago at the same time, what did you do ? "". he even make me feel around my neck the burning sensation of the hangman rope. i can't help it. i really do my best. i have friends who knows me for years and keep telling me that i have accomplished alot. but i can't help it i am gonna tell you why today i didn't listen to the monkey even if the sound of is cymbals was outstanding. i have an amazing partner. she is always there for me. she loves me like no one ever did. she is so innocent, pure. she comes for a loving family and really tries hard to understand what i went through. that's why i don't want to end it, i can't. i don't want her to ever go the trauma of coming home and finding me swinging from a belt in my office. she does not deserve that. i am going to bed now, and tomorrow when i wake up i am gonna restart my struggles with the monkey. i am gonna fight and i am going to win, or at least make him quiet for a bit. but i know the sucker will be looking at me with is smile going hear to hear. but i'll make him make before he can play. that will be my little victory. thank you for reading me. take care of yourself.",0
"yawn. ... i just moved to a new city. i'm horrible at making new friends. i'm naturally fairly quiet and i've been told that i come across as cold and intimidating to people who don't know me. it doesn't help that i simply don't have any interest in being friends with most people that i come across. sigh. it must be nice to be the sort of person who is happy to make friends and socialize with pretty much anyone. i hate the feeling that i'm wasting time. i'm not going back to school until the winter semester. i don't really need to work right now, and i don't really have any interest in doing so either... there's a dead tree that i can see from my window, ravens like hanging out on it for some reason. i envy the way they live, most of them seem to have a partner, there seems to be a sense of community among them... it would be nice, living a simple life, flying around... being a person is fine, but it's messy and needlessly complicated humans have a lot of potential as individuals, but i feel like society isn't really healthy for us. hmm... well, whatever, i'm not even looking for advice or anything really. i guess i just wish that i had more interest in doing anything, or that i had someone interesting to do boring stuff with, or that... hm... shrug. i don't know. i'll manage i guess. i posted here because i have a fairly long history of depression and moderate anhedonia among others things. what i've written makes me feel like my problems are trivial and should be easily solvable though, i guess. haha...ha...",0

"i ve lived way past the point where i ve wanted to be alive. i told myself i d be done with life after high school, then it turned into after college, and now i m six years after graduating with a degree and i still don t wanna be alive but i love my boyfriend and my cats too much to do that to them. i just feel like a constant failure all the time, i work at a shitty dead end job that i don t even like and didn t even wanna stay at this long but i still don t have my license because of anxiety issues and not having someone else who has an id so i can feel comfortable learning to drive. i used to be smart, idk if i still am and just gave up on everything or i ve just lost all will to try and better myself. it just feels like there s no way out of the shitty situation i m in except for offing myself. people continuously expect too much of me and i came to the realization about a month ago that i m pretty sure i ve been legitimately autistic my whole life but my parents didn t want to accept that reality and never got me any kind of help to avoid making themselves look bad. i feel like everyone around me thinks of me as re arded despite me never telling anyone i had any issues worse than just anxiety and depression. it s all just in how other people treat me. it just feels like people think i m a lot dumber than i actually am. i don t feel like i could ever have the life i wanted at this point. every cry for help i ve tried to give just lead to hostility and fear mongering. i just don t want to exist anymore because i know i ve let so many people including myself down. i have no more energy to try and better myself, i barely ever have the energy to get through the day. all i want is to be happy but no matter what i do or try i end up in a lot of mental and emotional anguish. i know something is very wrong with me but i m at the point where i feel like i can t be fixed anymore. i wish i could go back in time and do everything differently but i know i can t so i just wish i could delete myself. i don t want to be sad or angry or depressed anymore, i just want to be gone.",0
"lithium and depression. so i ve tried many medications for my depression, one of them that i have been on for over a year is lithium. i never really felt like it did anything and i am so extremely thirsty and it makes me shake. i tried to lower my lithium dose over a month ago with the help of a psychiatrist and for a couple of weeks i felt better than i had in a long time. not manic or anything i just felt like things would be ok. but now i ve crashed into a depression, and i spoke to my mental health nurse saying i didn t want to go back on more lithium. she spoke to a psychiatrist and they told me to bring up my lithium dose a little bit but not back to what it was. but i m not feeling better. today they told me to go back on the full dose of lithium and i feel like have haven t been listened to at all. and i worry that when i finally get to see my psychiatrist she will insist i stay on the lithium instead of finding a more bearable solution. i don t know what to do. i m so depressed and i know i should just take the lithium, i m just so tired of medication and the side effects. when i thought i d be able to come off the lithium i was ok with the side effects because i knew i wouldn t have to deal with it forever, but now it seems like i ll have to be on it for much longer i can t bear the idea and it makes me so sad. i don t know how to stick up for myself and i d never bring someone to my appointments. it s all just too much. what would you do in this situation?",0
"damn is this really it?. it's hard to get out of bed for long without feeling useless and being bombarded with intrusive thoughts. just bathing seems exhausting now. i spent 3 years in a career field i thought i wanted, learned i hated it and am now transitioning to something new but it'll take a while. thought i wanted to create content and make music but quickly learned that i really don't have the drive or confidence for it. constantly feel regret and embarrassment for how i've handled things in the recent past. split with my ex of 2 years because we were only spiraling together. i have no friends at all, and family members who were once close just feel awkward to talk to now. feeling spent and washed up, all at the tender age of 22... and hope of anything changing get clouded by the fact that i've grown out of all my old interests. music that's coming out nowadays doesn't captivate me like what was being released when i was a bit younger. gaming doesn't entertain me anymore. i've lost all the charisma i used to have, and have somehow forgotten how to maintain casual conversation. i don't do social gatherings anymore because of how jarring it feels walking into any club bar party alone, knowing that covid and monkeypox going around... with literally nothing to talk about. just spells anxiety for me, and and an awkward time for sure. i don't even want material things, just better relationships with my family and a few friendships that don't feel forced. opportunities for that are all behind me now though, so hobbies? idk ",0

"i don't know what to do anymore.. hey, this is a throwaway acc. my life honestly isn't that terrible compared to others so i don't know what is wrong with me and why i have no motivation to do anything. i'm 15 and a rising sophomore in hs. i feel like a disappointment and a failure to everybody around me. i don't have the motivation to do anything anymore or try to change myself for the better. i want to kms but i don't have the courage to do so when i think about the people around me. i just don't know what to do anymore. i wanted to become a psychiatrist but it feels pointless now, i am basically failed my first year of hs. i know i can do better if i try but i just can't seem to find any motivation to do so. i just stopped trying to do good in school, became more introverted the past few years. i used to be extremely extroverted and i thought it was because i moved to us from india so i wasn't used to everything so i became introverted but it seems like i was depressed way before than i thought i was. i have a poor self esteem because my family since they comment about my body a lot. i know they are doing it so i can change but it doesn't help me. i want to tell them all of this, to make them stop making me feel worse everyday but they already went through so much and i don't want to add more burden or things they need to worry about. i wanted to talk to my best friend about this but i feel like i would burden her so here i am. whenever i have some motivation to do something about myself, someone in my family says something and i get angry and just don't do it anymore. i did try ignoring them but my relationship with them got really bad because we argued everyday and stuff and so i act like i'm fine with them so it's pretty hard to just block them out. my mom has breast cancer and had mastectomy recently and my grandpa is getting a surgery soon because one of his heart walls deteriorated a lot. my mom is a single parent who raises me and my brother 22 but he moved to a different state . she doesn't really know how i feel since i've never told her, she recently went through the surgery i mentioned earlier and she got one removed so her breasts removed so self esteem is pretty low as well. she always says how weird she looks and how weird her body looks. i really don't want her to feel like that because to me, she doesnt look like that at all. i don't understand why i look so bad to her when she doesn't to me. i do tell her that she doesn't look weird or anything like that but i don't think she really understands. i lived with my grandparents for two years because my brother and mother went to us and i couldn't go yet since i didn't have my visa. during that time, my grandmother was extremely abusive and manipulative. i don't know how to feel about her right now even though i know she guilt trips a lot and abused me before. she is living with us atm because of my mother's illness and she has gotten better. i think. but when i lived with her, i was in fourth grade and i almost committed suicide because my mother never abused me physically and mentally before, but i didn't have the courage to do it when i thought of my mother and how she would feel. i still want to do it but i still can't find the courage. i know i should tell my family about all this but that would just add more burden and i don't want to be more of a burden than i already am. what should i do? i don't know what to do anymore. should i just tell them? also, thank you so much for reading all this, it really helps to just write out everything.",0

"i day dream about being dead.. so i've always had a curiosity about the past, people who lived in it, history etc.. well recently, as in the last few months, i've gained an interest in the 6 7 8 's and key people from those years. the stories of john belushi and doug kennedy in particular stick out to me and make me feel that, perhaps, they received the best fate possible. they're remembered, with reverence, by a lot of people. not to mention people i myself personally know knew? ...dead, gone, and yet people love them, more so in death than in life. i'm not suicidal, not in the traditional sense. i was in a coma in 2 12 for 2 weeks and ever since that, l've wanted to die. sometimes i go through periods where the idea strikes my conscious a little more intensely than others but i wouldn't actively pursue my own death...however i'd be very, very disappointed if it were prevented again. tl;dr what am i supposed to be feeling about having a very deep desire to die?",0

"i'm stuck. i'm struggling real bad with my depression. i've tried like 6 different medications and none of them have helped at all and healthcare professionals i talk to keep transferring me to other professionals because everyone is at a loss about what to do with me, and i feel bad because all those professionals truly want to help me but i keep failing to respond to any treatment. it's been 8 years and nothing has helped me. my biggest issue currently is my free time. i have energy to do some things, but problem is that absolutely nothing interests me or gives me satisfaction. i'm just so numb to everything at this point. so i just lay in my bed and watch yt videos, because my thoughts go super dark if i'm not doing something. but every time i kinda feel like i could do something, i just.. can't. i used to draw and take walks, but those just irritate me now instead of making me feel good. i could cook, but all food is just like cardboard in my mouth. this also makes grocery shopping even more taxing than it already is, because i don't wanna eat anything on the shelves but i gotta buy something, y'know? so i just walk around aimlessly until i have a random assortment of goods in my cart that looks like it'd feed me for a week. i can't come up with any hobby i'd actually wanna bother with. i've looked into options but i genuinely have no interest for anything. like. at all. so i just sit around at home, waiting for the night to come so i can sleep instead of anxiously thinking ""what should i do, i have to do something i've been inside for a week, i have to do something but i don't wanna but i gotta..."" all day. this existence is exhausting and it's been so long that at this point i'm starting to think maybe i don't even have depression, maybe i'm just not a person who is capable of enjoying life? maybe i'm just not meant for this? i don't know what to do anymore.",0

"is that a sort of anxiety attack?. i've been so used to things like this that i somehow never questioned it but today i actually started wondering if what i have is sort of an anxiety attack. i always only knew panic attacks and the symptoms didn't really match mine. yeah i have trouble breathing but i don't feel like i'm gonna gave an heartattack or anything like that i know it's simplified but you get what i mean it's rather like i'm losing my mind? so when i have a rather okay day, i tend to not get too much bothered by crowds and ppl in general. i don't feel comfortable but i'm not really anxious but there are days, when i really don't feel good, my reaction changes so much. so it often starts with me feeling a little disoriented just a little bit and it grows into some sort of overwhelming stimulation, like friends talk to me and i feel confused, unable to really comprehend what they say and i wish i could tell them to just leave me alone rn because its too much. my breathing gets faster but i'm not even sure if my heartbeat is actually going faster. i just feel like i can't breath properly. i often start to sweat. almost simultanously, my legs begin to shake as if all my energy had been just drained from my body and i use all i have left to keep my body up i feel like if i give in, i would just collapse on the ground talking to ppl in this situation is incredibly hard and i have to restrain myself from shouting at them to shut up and to leave me alone. i feel totally weird, like i'm not completely there not dissociating, where you lose all sense of your surroundings and can't remember what happened but at the same time i'm hyperly aware of my surroundings at least when it happens in public, which it does 9 of the time . it's this weird mix of panic, overstimulation and dissociating. when i sit down, put my headphones on i tend to get myself to calm down quite quickly but i get so tired after, that it's hard for me to even keep my eyes open and i wish for nothing more than to lay in my comfortable bed. is that an anxiety attack? i have absolutely no clue what it could be.",0
"i feel so depressed and lost and i have no idea what to do or who to talk to.. hello everyone, i am a 24 year old female working in it. i just graduated from college in january, and i thought everything would get better for me aka i thought i d be less depressed after i landed a job in a different state, which is something i ve always wanted to do. however, i unfortunately turned out to be wrong. for a short background story, i ve pretty much dealt with depression and anxiety all my life, especially growing up in an abusive household. i always struggled in school elementary, middle, high school, and college and had a very difficult time finishing college. i failed almost all of my classes and got on academic probation twice. i was trying to major in biology at first because my parents forced me to they wanted me to be a doctor , and even though i didn t want to, i tried. but, depression and the lack of interest got to me and i ended up not majoring in biology which made my parents extremely angry. i honestly had nothing i was passionate about, so i just chose to try to major in computer science because you could make good money with it. well, it ended up being too hard for me and my mental health and i ended up failing all of my classes and getting into academic probation. and, i was in therapy when i started to major in computer science. i also have to mention that at this time i was struggling with an eating disorder and with my weight, so that has also added a lot to my depression and anxiety. i just felt awful about myself; my abusive parents, my weight, my eating this was my coping mechanism at the time and it still kind of is, although not as bad as before , failing all of my classes, pretty much having no social life, etc. so, my therapist told me to take some easy classes so that i could get out of the probation, and so i did. that s what saved me from getting kicked out. so then, i decided to choose an easier major, it it s very easy in my university so i think that s why i was able to graduate. around this time i also started to take adhd medication which helped me a lot with studying and actually getting work done in school. i was able to focus and had more motivation then i ve ever had in my life. but then, the medication stopped working and actually started to give me panic attacks so i stopped using it. i then went to another psychiatrist and she prescribed me antidepressants which kind of helped. thankfully also around this time i was able to land an internship in a different state and i was so happy about it. i was like wow, i can t believe i actually succeeded at something for once. plus, it was in a different state which meant that i could stay away from my family there. that internship was amazing, laid back, and i got to have so much fun because i was not under the control of my family. plus, the internship was in a state which was very hot and sunny and i found that this helped my moods. after the internship, the company offered me a full time position after i graduated college and i was very happy to accept it. the pay was good and plus i got the chance to move out of my family s house for good, somewhere far away. i love the place i live in now. however, right now i am 6 months into my job and i m feeling extremely depressed again. the job is much more stressful than i thought it would be it s a tech support type role and i didn t really have proper training. the problems i have to try to solve are really difficult and i still don t feel comfortable taking cases at all. what made it even more difficult for me is that i was assigned a mentor, but she was incredibly rude to me and never seemed like she wanted to help. she would always scold me for not understanding a customer issue or not doing something correctly, or even asking her for help. i had a secondary mentor too and unfortunately he was also not that nice and was condescending sometimes. right now i am at the point where i feel like this job is way too stressful for me and i just feel so burnt out, anxious, and depressed. this job is all i think about and i try to do everything i can to distract myself and it s not helping. the thing that s giving me the most anxiety is that if i quit or get fired, i will have to pay back my sign on bonus to the company, which is a lot of money for me. i just feel stuck, lost, and like a failure again. why can t i just suck it up and do the job like my other coworkers? why can t i just have at least an ounce of motivation? why do i feel so fucking depressed again? why is everything i m doing not helping therapy, antidepressants, distractions ? i work from home, so yesterday and today i left my place to drive around and do random stuff because i just couldn t stand looking at that computer screen, and at this point i don t care if i get fired anymore. but, at the same time i m scared because if i do get fired or quit, that bonus will be taken away and my healthcare benefits will be gone. anyone have any advice? i feel like i ve tried to talk to so many people about this but i still feel like i really need help, i don t know what to do. thanks for listening. i also have to mention that my mother is pressuring me to get married and will not stop talking about it everyday. she has crazy expectations for my boyfriend and expects that we get married by next summer and that he has to get me a very expensive ring or else she will be angry which i am not going to listen to her, but the fact that she keeps bringing this up and gets angry when i don t agree with her is driving me crazy . she also complains about my weight she has done so all my life and still complains till this day . she calls me fat and says that i don t look good anything, and she even thinks my boyfriend probably doesn t like my body. all of this is just too much ",0

"i can't talk to people, not without completely hating myself. don't know how to solve this. before i completely isolated myself from my classmates, i already hated myself in any attempt to communicate with them and anyone else . i corrupted my identity daily to be a person who doesn't represent me, just to be able to talk to my friends and make friends. when i don't embrace the character the results are even worse, as my thoughts don't sync with my lines and all that comes out are disconnected and involuntary words that i wouldn't have liked to say. i hate myself with every word that comes out of my mouth. but still, i hadn't walked away, it was simply moving on despite all the self hatred. at the beginning of the year i had an episode of depersonalization that lasted just over a month, i walked away from everyone and only returned inevitably when classes resumed. but that day i felt the need to be in the presence of other people and i ""fitted in"" again. now that i don't feel that, it's different, i find myself in a state of deep inertia, i don't feel like talking to anyone which isn't necessarily a bad thing because at least i don't hate myself that much or doing anything other than the activities. i spend breaks in my desk and sometimes i feel like leaving classes because the classroom becomes an unbearable environment. it's excruciating when someone i used to talk to starts a conversation. i would spend the day quiet if my friend who wants to have sex with me don't waste so much of your time trying to cheer me up. i know he will soon get tired of me and my condition, and i will be alone. i would very much like to be able to express my thoughts.",0

"undiagnosed but questioning if i may have an issue or if i am just too emotional.. i have gone through depressive episodes ranging from days to weeks. i am 3 now but have been experiencing these episodes for at least the last 9 or 1 years. i saw a doctor about them when they kept recurring on a monthly to bi monthly basis. the doctor told me that because they don t last longer than a few days that it wasn t depression. i am questioning his opinion now. during the week i feel fine most days. i keep very busy. i have work, school, am an avid gym goer and a multitude of other hobbies. the weekends scare the shit out of me. if i am stagnant i usually get that voice in my head that bombards me with negative thought patterns. these can last into the next week until i start getting back into my routine, which can be very hard to start up. i recently made the connection with my down and out weekends and stagnation. i had few if any episodes during the winter this year. this year was also the first time i started reffing hockey. my weekend was full of physical and mental activity. now that it is the summer, i am going through more and more of these episodes. these episodes cause a lot of issues in my relationship. they make it hard to get motivated for anything and make me want to hide away. i cant help but wonder sometimes what is wrong with me? when i see people that are happy all the time. i struggle to keep myself baseline more days than not. ive done a lot of therapy and it doesn t help me feel better, it just helps me control my reactions to things. im sick of this cycle. what am i supposed to do?",0

"activities that used to bring me joy are now boring. i go through mood swings regularly but my baseline has been lower recently than it has in years past. i no longer find pleasure and dopamine rushes from activities i used to love doing, ie weightlifting, listening to music, and sex. i still do them because they are habits, but they feel so mundane and as if i am just going through the motions just to do it, with no release of good feelings and accomplishment. for those who have been in this boat, what actions can i take to enjoy these things again?",0
"interesting observation surrounding depression and food. i recently had a colonoscopy and thus had to fast for over 24 hours. my mood during this fasting process was the best it's been in a long time. i felt less depressed and less anxious than i'd felt in a while. today i went to go get lunch with my grandfather. i hadn't eaten all day. on the way to lunch, my mood was pretty good. after eating, however, my mood nosedived and i was back to feeling depressed again. depression is complex, but it does seem that food, or certain foods, could be exacerbating it.",0

"tired of my brain always focusing on the one negative thing and not seeing the many positive things in my life. 99 of people in my life love me but my brain doesn't ever care about how loved i am. it's always the 1 of people that do dislike me that really gets to me. i've been super depressed this week since i am thinking more and more that someone i consider as an adopted little sister actually very strongly dislikes me and hates being around me. it hurts so much realizing they feel this way. i feel like such a pathetic loser. i guess i'll just try to get out of their way in the future since it's just too much to bare knowing they probably secretly despise every interaction with me. i wish i even knew why they disliked me so much. i also wish it didn't bother me so much. but it really does because i love them so, so much. meanwhile, i don't think they'd even care if i suddenly disappeared from their life forever tomorrow.",0

"new wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement. we've been seeing a worrying increase in pro suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. this undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide. we've created a wiki that covers these issues. we hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report. it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 1 committed, i'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro suicide comments. the full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at r suicidewatch wiki incitement http: www.reddit.com r suicidewatch wiki incitement . we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non judgemental support to our ops, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms. please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by sending us a modmail https: www.reddit.com message compose?to 2fr 2fsuicidewatch with a link. we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines, please report it both to the reddit sitewide admins http: www.reddit.com report and to us in modmail. thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us. r suicidewatch wiki incitement http: www.reddit.com r suicidewatch wiki incitement summary it's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. it's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful. validate feelings and experiences, not self destructive intentions we're here to offer support, not judgement. that means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express. suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring. the most reliable way we know to de escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do. but there's an important line to draw here. there's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. it's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision. anything that condones suicide, even passively, encourages suicide. it isn't supportive and does not help. it also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. do not treat any op's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out. in the most useful empirical model we have https: www.apa.org science about psa 2 9 6 sci brief , the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. so, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""i hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded. how to avoid validating suicidal intent keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide. people who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions. unfortunately, many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive https: www.speakingofsuicide.com 2 15 3 3 what not to say . in particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""i don't understand what you're going through and i'm not going to try"". people who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same. it doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort. most people who are suicidal want to end their pain, not their lives. it's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. but preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. an unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible . we don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. it's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed. for every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. this can depend on many personal and situational factors. but when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it. we go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in this psa post https: www.reddit.com r suicidewatch comments 25igd7 whats wrong with it gets better what if it doesnt which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines. there are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives . to avoid accidentally breaking the anti incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead. do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world. our talking tips http: redd.it igh87 offer more detailed guidance. look out for deliberate incitement. it may come in disguise. often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon https: en.wikipedia.org wiki william francis melchert dinkel . people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them. they will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge. they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above. specifically you might see people doing the following: encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying. there are always more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping actively or passively them to end their lives . creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy. they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self loathing emotions and self destructive impulses. since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation. many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help. a couple of key points to keep in mind: skilled suicide intervention peer or professional is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment. contrary to pop culture myths, it does not involve persuasion ""don't do it "" , cheerleading ""you've got this "" or meaningless false promises ""trust me, it gets better "" , or invalidation ""let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think "" . anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro suicide. of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help. choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible. any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq post http: redd.it 1c7ntr . the goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. we know that no individual or system is perfect. mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need. please let us know discreetly https: www.reddit.com message compose?to 2fr 2fsuicidewatch if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. we don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",0
"please remember that no activism of any kind is ever allowed here. no matter what day it is.. activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue is absolutely against the rules here at all times. please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental health and suicide prevention activism. it's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. most of us, one way or another, are mental health activists irl. but activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. we used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming. we do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time. tl;dr any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue rather than a request for personal support is not allowed here. please report everything of the nature that you see.",0

"i don't get it. society doesn't want me alive, but doesn't want me to die either?. there's just something i can't wrap my head around. i've grown up in the culture that suicide should be prevented. that there are compassionate people who would want to stop you, plead with you. they can't help you otherwise... but they'll help you then. help...? so i cling to this idea but i don't understand it. i'm not helped by society otherwise. any amount of time of the street i would most certainly pass away. people do all the time. nobody cares. why do they care suddenly when you're not yet a homeless nobody and it's suicide...? i also just don't understand, why if i'm so useless, and need to be taken care of, if i shouldn't just die? i don't get it? i can't live. no one should have to use their life to supporting mine. society doesn't make it happen. there are no supports to access for me, for millions of people. don't people want us to die? can i get assisted suicide? i think in canada they recently opened it up for people with mental health issues. i am scared of doctors... they aren't trustworthy. honestly they are horrible people in their positions. take advantage. i wish only people who wanted to be doctors became doctors. the people who wanted to be there because they cared. honestly, the other folks just shouldn't be allowed. they do great harm. it's such a dissonance that just brings me to panic tears. no one wants to keep me alive, but i'm supposed to believe they don't want me to die either? it's just unfair if i just lay down and wait to die, i'm a burden on the people closest to me. there's just the one... that makes it harder... on me, because it's all on him then. but ultimately, to not have to afford me just seems like it would be so much better for him. right? i mean that's just logic. it shouldn't be on just some other poor sucker to keep me alive. yet it is. that's unfair. if i didn't eat, didn't have needs, didn't want thing, didn't influence decisions, then all his money would be his to choose what to do with. he'd have more of it. i'm so damn sad.",0

"currently living between life or death. hello everyone, been in a rough mental state for the past 3 months. my life has been going completely downhill. i once lived a joyous life with no sign of suicide at all. i felt like i had it all going for me honestly. but, the past 3 months have been absolute hell. my wife just told me that she doesn't want to be with me anymore our 1 yr dating anniversary just passed on july 24 my mother hates me, i'm currently 2 k in debt because of stupid decisions that i have made, and i have struggled with trying to ""better"" myself. my wife just told me an hour ago that i am a ""small minded motherfucker"" and that ""i will have no direction in life because i don't look at the bigger picture"". that doesn't help with my mental state and at this rate, she doesn't really care for how i feel. i don't think anybody does. i have our 2 dogs with me and i have a plan to drop them off at her house we live separately, i live in louisiana because of the military, she lives in california and then killing myself on the way back somewhere in the middle of texas. i know nobody will care. my wife told me that if i were to commit suicide, it would make me a coward and to instead, be a man and fight my demons. i have accepted that i will take the cowardly way out to let her know just how much of a coward her husband really was. my death will not only put weight off her shoulders, but weight off my mothers shoulders as well. i have came to conclusion that death is the only positive answer to my problems. i want to randomly disappear and never come back, so that is what i will do. nobody will notice anyways",0

"feeling completely empty today. might do it. long story short, i lost my best friend to suicide about 7 months ago and i've been horrible since. lost my job, kicked out by my family, struggling in school. i had a small group of friends who knew about my situation, and while they acknowledged it, they never really openly offered to discuss it with me not their fault though . i was supposed to have some big plans today with my friends, along with getting some coffee with another female friend beforehand. i woke up feeling ok for the first time in a while, only to have my friend cancel on me. that's alright, i thought. i sent my other friends a message asking when we were scheduled to go to our other event only for them to be active on instagram and not reply to it. found out they changed plans last second and left without me. they saw the message and didn't reply, and now i've spent an entire afternoon doing nothing at all, alone with my deranged mind. i thought i had some trustworthy friends, but alas. i don't feel especially angry today, just hollow. i'm so confused as to why my life turned out like this. i'm comfortable with the idea that i might die soon, out of sheer frustration and confusion",0

"i think i'm ready to go. if this is what the rest of my life is going to be like that i don't want it. my ex destroyed my life because i got sick of her taking her anger out on me and i tried to break up with her. and in return she told lies about me to everybody i used to know, telling them that i cheated on her. everybody believed it and so they all left even my family disowned me. i've got no one. when i was in the hospital for an asthma attack about a month ago they asked me about emergency contacts and i didn't have anyone's name i could put there. not a soul. i'm very sick now, my medication effexor that my doctor makes me take that i can't go off of without seriously risky side effects is making me very sick. i have diarrhea every day to the point where i bleed and everything i eat i throw up even water. i'm constantly dehydrated and i've had these symptoms along with a pounding headache for about 2 weeks and if i do in fact die my body is just going to rot in this apartment because no one's going to be wondering where i'm at. my corpse will probably be left in here for months since i've got my bills on autopay. considering how shitty maintenance is around here they're probably not even going to do anything when it starts to smell. all i ever wanted from life was companionship. everybody i've ever met like me said that eventually they just gave up and we're happy with the fact that they would always be alone but i don't know how to do that. they say it's because that i seek validation from an outside source but that's not even it. i'm just very very alone. no one can imagine the level of alone that i am. i am the most isolated person on earth. i was born to a couple of stupid hillbillies who didn't want a second child and because they had me late in life i was born with scoliosis. we were one of those old fashioned families who doesn't really bother trying to fix sickly family members, we just shut them away in the house and forget about them. i wasn't allowed to go to public school, i was homeschooled. kept away from the other children because my parents were ashamed of me. and i was too weak to play with them anyway. my entire life was just spent watching the world go by and never being able to take part in it. on the outside looking in, shut away from everyone. it was like there was a whole world out there but i was stuck in this stupid little fucking bubble that i wasn't allowed to exit. it almost felt like this lifetime is one big nasty timeout session. where i get placed in the corner and i get to watch everybody else have fun and make friends with each other and i don't get to be a part of it. i want more than anything to connect with someone anyone. a real connection, shallow friendship isn't enough but i'll never have that. i don't know how i live this life anymore. it's been years since anyone has touched me in any way other than to hit me. i haven't been hugged since my ex ruined my reputation and i don't think i ever will be again. and that's all i want is just a fucking god damn hug which i will never get after the things she said about me no one would fucking hug me. no one would even sit down with me and watch a fucking movie or have a drink with me. i could pay someone a 1 and they still wouldn't play with me. everybody looks at me like i'm a goddamn monster and i just can't take it anymore. so i'm here. waiting for someone to give me the benefit of the doubt. listening ear that i will never find. a hug that will never come and i'm just about ready to put myself out of my fucking misery. i hope to god the side effects of this medication kill me. and if they don't i'll finish the job myself i'm sick of this. i'm sick of my stupid solitary confinement sentence especially since it's for something i didn't even fucking do. all of this isolation. just because i was born physically deformed. and just because i didn't want a certain girl taking her anger out on me anymore. i'm done. i'm fucking done i don't think i can take this kind of isolation anymore and if this is what the rest of my life is going to be like i don't want it.",0

"i m so tired. man another rant. i read endless posts about shit like this. i guess there s no use in really wanting to take anyone with me when i die. i honestly don t see a use, if the world is so good, then why has it never showed itself. sure you have to work for it but when not a shred of light is visible in this damned reality then what s the point? death is like the time before birth. there s nothing. no heaven. no hell. just nothing. it s like your consciousness never existed. i m ashamed but i fucking crave it i just want to not have consciousness i hate every damn minute of this, the only distractions i have are damn birds that will never understand me, and some stupid shit on the internet. i spend my life so far fucking staring at a screen or staring at birds that never even notice me, getting comfort more from these birds than any human ever has. even if there was something destined for my future i don t even wanna see it. there s no point being optimistic. this reality is just a facade of happiness all we do is fucking wake up eat work eat sleep. we spend hours doing stupid shit and sleeping or working. after years of that shit you just eventually die. even if you did get your dream home and a good family then still whats it for, why do we even deserve it. it s like nobody understand it, they just say oh there s something in your life waiting for you ohh fucking no there s not and even if there was theres no use waiting for it. the population always votes against the best things. so why should death be considered bad. everything that s hated, usually is actually good. we have thousands of stupid campaigns against suicide, but none voting for it. people seriously don t want me to be at peace, to be dead. they d rather fucking keep me on this damn earth suffering every second thinking of how much of a fucking savior they are. that damn hospital kept me for two fucking months and didnt give a shit how traumatizing it was, keeping me fucking seperated from my family, despite knowing i had intense previous trauma relating to abandonment. they saw how fucking much of an impact it had on me, having fucking panic attacks every hour, in the fucking knee position rocking in the corner, crying so much theres no tears left. not even able to talk, or eat, fucking reverting back to basic human instincts. they fucking laughed when i completely shut down after witnessing another patient heavily injure several staff. they didnt give a shit i felt unsafe and made me have a room near that fucking guy. and of course theres all those fucking stupid godamn quirky girls who think being in a mental ward is so quirky, well how about they get a fucking metal rod driven through their heads. how about they get their godamned brains splattered all over the walls yeah so quirky snd funny no its fuckin not. they fucking think its soooo godamned funny that i have sleep deprivation from having nightmares about the hospital, and being terrified of sleeping . they dont give a shit i purposfully throw up so ill fucking starve. they never give a shit about anything. god i hate this fucking society so much all the laws are godamned made to make people suffer and only give money to the rich.",0

"and after everything that happened i'm right back where i was.. i didn't have friends growing up until about 8th grade. i got lucky because some girl that had a crush on me invited me to come watch doctor strange with her and her friends. time passed and i joined her friend group and i guess i just got lucky to have that opportunity. i fucked up a lot as a friend, but i kept learning and trying and learning and trying, and i started to feel happy, but for some reason it all slipped away, in one moment. this isn't something i could've changed, we grew apart, but nobody ever gave me a warning, they just grew more distant from me and eventually admitted to it when i asked if they were tired of being friends with me. i worked my ass off and in the end it all slipped away. i can't be mad at them, i'm not their responsibility, but it's just sick. one day you've got a life and the next day you don't. maybe you saw it slipping away but nobody told you a thing until it was too late, and now i'm right where i started. nothing is fun. nothing makes me happy. i'm out of friends and no matter how hard i try i can't make any more, but it's worse now. now i've spent a couple years on drugs and in therapy to fix myself, i've put so much goddamned work in to make things right, to make myself a better man, and here i am, still like this. after all this time, i still can't fight this urge. i still struggle to get up and find a reason to live. a reason to work. a reason to try. i've got nothing to live for, nothing to die for, nothing to gain, and nothing to lose. college happens in 23 days but i have low hopes much is gonna change there. it just seems like another 2 years of classes but this time with the knowledge that i'm actively financially burdening myself and my mother.",0

"this is barely half of it really..... when i was about 1 year old, my dad stabbed my mom in the stomach with a knife. she didn't die from it physically. mentally she slipped away and became an alcoholic. i grew up in a foster family. they were only in it for the money and they were mentally abusive to me every day. i felt horrible, misunderstood, worthless, a burden. the worst was the contrast i got from their beloved grandchildren. they got everything they wanted, while i was left with nothing. i felt like harry potter but without the magic. i have always had trouble making friends. the few friends i had was even harder to keep. i still struggle with this today and recently i lost a big friend group due to a few bad apples in the bunch. when i was 16 i discovered that my foster mom were having an affair with a family friend. her phone had been ringing while i was home alone and i saw 1 missed calls from him. they were out eating dinner somewhere together my foster parents, the family friend and his wife i got curious about what had happened and started reading her texts. they were all from him about how he loved her and when they should meet again and shit like that. they had always held me to such a high moral standard. i could never do the slightest mistake, and if i did, they would berate me and make me feel like shit for weeks. so i confronted my foster mom with her affair a few days after that. she straight up denied it and told me i was a useless piece of shit that nobody would believe. i eventually showed my foster moms phone and the messages to my foster parents daughter and told her what had happened. she read the messages and told me that she would handle it. a few days later i am in their car, heading for a kind of halfway house for troubled teens with nowhere else to live. they dropped me off with a few of my belongings and i assume they sold the rest of my things. for the second time in my life i was ripped away from everything i had known, everyone i knew and this time i was on my own. i buried my feelings as deep as i could. walled off the sadness and thought i could forget about it. until one day i just exploded. i was in the middle of a classroom when i just started crying. i couldn't stop and i had to be taken to a acute psychiatric hospital for a talk with 2 doctors. they listened to my life story and just told me that they had encountered people whom had been through less than me, but were on hard drugs to cope. they congratulated me on not doing heroin and sent me on my way. i am 32 years old and still live in that city. i have never had a job. i don't have any friends. and i just sit in a one room flat all day, staring at my laptop screen. youtube videos, netflix shows, hbo. and once a week i go shopping for easy to make food, frozen pizzas and microwave dinners. i just keep myself alive. when i'm hungry i eat. when i'm tired i sleep. but i see no reason to keep myself alive anymore. i contribute nothing to society. i didn't finish school due to the move. and i have no future. the few romantic relationships i've had, ended because i'm just a hopeless loser with no life. i have had so many hobbies in my life. i cant even remember half of them. anything to take my mind off the shitty thoughts. the only hobby that i stuck with was playing guitar. but lately i don't even want to do that. i feel like a ghost. so why not become one? my last girlfriend broke up with me and my mind broke. i was hospitalized in a mental institution with suicidal thoughts. my lowest point there led me to a suicide attempt. i hung myself with a belt. everything turned black. the staff pulled me down on the floor and revived me. when i came to, i couldn't see. it felt like when your leg falls asleep but all over my body. i was confused and had no memory of what had happened. 2 years later i sit here in my tiny flat that i don't clean half my stuff is still in moving boxes from when i thought i would get evicted. and the other half of my stuff is scattered around the floor along with piles of trash and dust. when my girlfriend left me i drank a lot of alcohol and played loud music to drown out all the shit again. that's when my neighbor knocked on my door and attacked me with a stun gun. the following days i spent in bed terrified. then i got a notice that i was getting sued by the same neighbor for violence against him. he also had a bullshit witness that backed up his bullshit story and i lost the case. almost got evicted from my ""home"" because of that but i ended up not going to prison. i just had to stay off alcohol for a year and have weekly consultations with a police officer instead. i hate life and being alive. and i have decided not to stay. the only thing i like to do is to sit in the sun with a joint. but i cant get drugs where i live anymore. i feel like i have no future. i am just drowning every day. i go to sleep and wish i don't wake up every day. i am a hollow shadow of a person shaped piece of shit and my life cant get better. the prices of everything keeps going up, cigarettes, food, anything really. i think i will end my life soon. i can feel it in my bones. this world is not for me. all i can think of lately is to put my head on the train tracks and end it all.",0

why me?. i was born with brain problems because my mom did drugs. then when i was 3 i had a major head injury leaving with more brain problems. i can t read sometimes and then it comes back. my parents abused me all of my life suicidal thoughts started when i was 9. i m 21 now and can t get over the trauma from my parents. i can t get over that my head is mush and have seizure and the doctor told me i might not even have 2 years left. what am i fighting so hard for ? a couple extra shitty years that don t matter. my life doesn t suck. i grew up poor and now i have a job making more then anyone in my family could. yet i don t care i just can t do the pain of living anymore. i m starting my notes for everybody. i always just wondered why me.,0

"the pain is becoming unbearable.. i'm feeling like i'm running out of hope. i'm 27 yo, at age 18 i developed psychosis, pretty much a result of being socially rejected by my peers and having complete isolation, i've struggled along these last 9 years, but the pain is getting too much. nobody bothers about me. not even my own mother. i'm really quite tired of the pain. i've struggled and struggled and i feel like i was set up to fail in life. i'm tired of being a weirdo loser. ive had no success with women, still a virgin, i have no friends, and i have no reason to live. my sister is having me walk her down the aisle this month, after maybe 6 months i'll kill myself, so it's not too soon after her wedding. she might be having me walk her down the aisle but she doesn't bother ring text me at all. not even once. nobody does. i wanted to live life, but if nobody wants you, you are just left to rot, and you'll fucking hate me for this, but because i'm male, in primate society, i don't mean shit. it's impossible to build myself up when i'm bankrupt of emotional and spiritual energy, i'm dead inside. being isolated from other beings the last 8 years wilk do that to you. i don't want to be the loser society has set me up to be. i'd rather do the kind thing for myself and end the pain",0
idk if this belongs here but yea its along this topic so . so like im gonna kms thats guaranteed. shitty night with sh again after a week or so but yea im gonna kms whether depression gets there first or not. i mean like im also terrified of growing old. like terrified that ill die on my own terms even if im happy. i dont want people to be sad if it goes down that route because its what i want and im fully contempt with it. but if not then depression will kill me first and tbh thats probably more likely ,0

"i tried to go back to school today but i don't think i'm strong enough.. this summer has been a summer from hell. on june 12 of 2 21, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. he had always been a smoker and had been doing so since he was 14 years old. my mom has been the sole caregiver for him and she has nothing left in her tank, not for me, not for my dad, not for my siblings, not for anyone. my grandfather died on july 14, 2 22 at the age of 65. now that he has passed, we have been doing our best to go back to normal but unfortunately i have used food as comfort for the past several months. constant binge eating and feeling bad but then doing it again. i have gained 2 pounds in 13 months, all of it in fat. amp; x2 b; today i tried to go back to school and was immediately greeted with a ""what the fuck happened to you"" when my teammates saw me. my world fell apart. i have been broken down so many times this past year and to hear my teammates ask what happened, where i have been, if i still even want to play basketball anymore has made me think more and more about suicide than before. if i stick with basketball and life as a whole, the recovery process will be shit personified and i don't know if i'm strong enough. god be with you",0
"i fucking hate my life . i really fucking hate my life. i have always wanted to die since i was a little little girl. i keep thinking that life can t get any worse for me and to be sure i can make some changes and things will get better and so i do and things always end up inevitably worse. so all i ve ever wanted in life is to be a mother and a wife and i m neither of those anymore, so what the fuck am i supposed to do now? i honestly don t give a fuck about myself and i have no hopes and aspirations in life beyond being a mother and wife. i mean i m not even living in the right century. women are supposed to cook and clean and keep them mouth shut and do other than hold. that is not however it ever should ve been and that s all i ve ever known. i don t have any idea about life outside of the very close knit way i grew up. so you know it s time to be proactive and research it and figure it out. got to be resilient, right? got to find life beyond being a wife and mother. life beyond taking care of everyone nonstop. i type into google what to do with your life when you are no longer a mother and all that comes up is pages and pages of people who do not want to be mothers anymore and god damn that s all i want. it s just infuriating. i m pretty much alone in the world i don t even know why i m posting this shit. i guess i just feels like i m talking to someone. i don t know. i m just tired of sitting here all alone and pretending like everything s ok so i don t fall apart and give up. it is very defeating. i m honestly terrified of how things get worse at this point. to make sure it can t. but life always knows how to prove me wrong and so i m scared of the next horrible period of my life.",0

everything fills me with sorrow and reminds me of what i lack.. i can t look at couples or parents with their babies or birthday parties or graduations or promotions or anything positive without being filled with pangs of pain. it hurts. all of it hurts. it makes me want to disappear.,0
"i m a coward.. i 21 f had a very rough childhood and by the time i turned 13 i knew i had to end my life. that was my first and last attempt. my dad found me sprawled on the bathroom floor. i vaguely remember his concerned face through my dazed state. after i got my conscious back, he asked me to never do that again. this was the first time i saw tears in his eyes. i made a promise to myself, the day my father passes away is the day i go with him. my dad and i have a 54 year gap till then i d do everything in my power to make him proud. since then i ve caused self harm to myself but just enough to cause pain. i have also worked on my issues and have made peace with them. but my ultimate goal of departing with my father remained the same. but life was actually going great for a change. it s been eight months since i fell in love with a guy 22 m he s perfect and he s as in love with me as one can be. with him i seem to be planning a future and found a will to live. but then recently my academics have gone down again and the realization of letting my father down hit. suicidal thoughts have come flooding back. also that my dad is now 75 and sick. the time to stand on my promise is near.the only reason to not go ahead with it is my boyfriend but if i don t do this there be nothing i ll be worth of. it s been my only goal for 9 years. in the preparation for it i just broke up with my boyfriend but there is still something stopping me. i m scared. and stalling. i just wanted a place where i could vent out without the fear of being judged.",0
"found the courage and will to live over the last 2 years. am close to losing it. family lashes out at me every chance they can get. i keep making stupid mistakes. idk how long the friends i have will be able to put up with my bad decision making. i wasn't raised to know how to operate in this world wasn't even taught how to tie my shoes. had to teach myself how to cut meat, apply to college, clean a house. don't know how to buy a car or insurance or rent an apartment or pay taxes without help. i'm tired of being a burden. i live in housing that would leave someone else to clean me up. the idea of it makes me feel horrible, but i can't keep bulldozing everyone and everything around me. if a dog keeps biting , it should prob be put down, shouldn't it",0

one less sociopath. it would be doing the world a great favor and honestly i d only be missed for 6 months tops. 6 months of people grieving is way less than the fucking years spent suffering with myself. why do i gotta suffer just so ppl and family can still fucking ignore me and treat me like the toxic pariah that i am? it s like i m choking and they re just using a knife to take out the blockage,0
"my results are in a few hours and i might kill myself.. i am in an important year, and this score is the most important thing, i have repeated this year so i won't let my mental illnesses ruin it. got into therapy. but i was so unmotivated this year to study. i studied as i can. i kept getting hit by bad shit, grandpa died, loneliness, stress from family, the one person who helped me thru this was my gf who now is my ex. left my during my exams cause i fought alot with her, and i was stressed asf. that crushed me. i honestly didn't care about my exams. i studied and all day but i was having hard time sleeping kept having nightmares about that relationship and going to these exams.i was unmotivated to do anything. i told the people in my life, nobody cared. nobody showed me the support i need. i was stopping myself from cutting cause i needed to finish this year. on the last day, i had a panic attack and imagined my arm fucked. i didn't tho, met a friend, and went out. didn't tell anyone. as if anyone care. been sleeping most of the days. when i am awake, i am either exercising to let out emotions, taking cold showers, doing skills learned from therapy. or just reminiscing about her and me. barely eating. taking meds but doesn't stop my anxiety or depression anymore. feeling numb. i try using humor to cope with this shit. but doesn't work anymore. trying to talk to my brain and comfort him. not working. i think it's just about time. it is 4 am and can't sleep, so yea. sorry for scattered texts, i am just all over the place.",0

"at the end of my rope. i have had thoughts of suicide for a while now and lack of self worth. i have been through some traumatic experiences in my past regarding being groomed, physically abused by my dad and a partner, forcibly impregnated, and having personal pictures of me posted on sites under my full name. whenever i am super stressed or in an environment that takes a toll on me mentally, flashbacks of how my dad would call me names like ""weirdo"",""r arded"", and him hitting me would flare up as well as an ex making me have sex with him everyday. my ex got tired of me and recently told me to kill myself over text and i think the newest cherry on top is about 1 minutes ago my sister came into my room and started telling me i won't amount to anything in life and only old 4 year old men would want me, she has made fun of me for my abortion in the past and having sex with guys outside of my own race. the thing that hurt my feelings the most this time is when she said i deserved to be beaten by my ex and that she feels embarrassed to be my sister. i can't stop crying now and i don't think i can live like this anymore. it is almost my 19th birthday and i don't think i will be alive for it. i am sorry for being a disappointment.",0
"feel like i m reaching the end of my line. about 3 years ago, i told myself that i would just keep going until i couldn t anymore. in a morbid sense, it was kind of a little inspiration. i would try to be happy and do what i needed to do and if i couldn t make it, i would just end it all. i was planning in depth how to end it all back then anyhow, so this was kind of little a little bonus run on life. i m in my 4 s. i had been extremely unhappy in my marriage for a good number of years. she just made my life miserable. she was spoiled, ungrateful, manipulative, overbearing and i felt like a man servant prisoner. for years i just told myself that i would wait until the kids went off to college and then split. simple plan on paper. as the years and months went by tho, i just couldn t see myself making it that long. i was planning out accidents. places where i could lose control of my car. staircases that could most likely get the job done. something that insurance wouldn t contest. i snapped and said nope tho. i left. i told my wife i couldn t take it anymore. i told her i didn t love her and i left. i figured i would just give this a chance first, right? things are just hard. really hard. it s been almost 3 years now since i left. i see her all the time. she texts me all the time and for the most part it s been cordial. i mean, there were obviously horrible moments especially in the beginning. i see my daughters at least 5 times a week. i started dating someone 8 months ago and she found out two weeks ago. it s been really hard since. i get walls of texts about how much i am hurting the girls and how i m a terrible sick human. i never thought i would be back in a state of mind where i thought i could go through with it, but it s so tempting. i wish i could just go to sleep and not wake up. i wish i could just go away and everyone would forget about me. i m desperately trying to find a psychiatrist for an in person session, but everything is virtual and it s just not going to get through to me in the same way. i feel like rock bottom is right around the corner. i m so sorry for being like this and for causing so much pain in the lives of others.",0

"is there something worth living in this world?. i genuinely don't know. i'm not a religious person, so i don't think there is some highly spiritual meaning in being alive and then dying. i tried to convince myself there is some things worth living. it just doesn't work if i take things seriously and not trying being delusional on purpose. this world is mostly a fucking shithole. no way it can get better. no way people can get better. all relationships between people are just people being delusional to themselves and to each other. in reality nobody gives a fuck about me and i don't give a fuck about nobody, seems fair. but what's the point then? is there any point in doing anything, if nothing makes me happy anymore?",0
"i can't deal. my parents absolutely abhor one another, and i tried to explain it to them, knowing full well how it was going to turn out. and then i try to explain something so simple to my mom and she doesn't understand. this is my life: i explain things over and over and over again, and nobody gets it or believes me. the only logical reason for it is because i'm a kid, and nobody believes a kid. even if i explain it at a kindergarten level, nobody understands. my whole life, people write off what i have to say as unimportant and wrong, when its been shown, time and time again, that i'm right. and even when i show people that, they still say i'm wrong. and i can't do this anymore. nothing helps. i've been sent away to program after program after program and i really don't see the point in living. i can't do it anymore. i give up. and please, if you respond, i beg of you to not say anything like, ""you're a kid. it will get better. wait until you're an adult."" i've heard that enough.",0

"i think it's time?. at this point, the amount of times i've planned out my own suicide down to the minute has probably surpassed fifty. maybe a hundred. i've been planning for a while. every day, for years and years. never went through with it until well, not until now. i'm not writing this and then going to kick the can immediately after. but soon. you'd think i wouldn't be so certain. especially since i've never actually tried to do it. but i think at this point, it's do or die. well. not precisely do or die, since doing is also dying, but you know what i mean. end of the line and all that shit. i've written so many suicide notes in the past. some for a general audience, some addressed to a specific person. i think part of the reason i didn't end up sending them was because they weren't right. whatever that means. at this point though, i don't think there is a right. there's no optimal way to end this. i'm not going to think of the perfect thing to say. i'm not going to feel a magical moment of calm washing over me or whatever the fuck. shit doesn't work like that, at least not for me. either i do it or i don't. and i can't bear the latter option. so this is it. i've been lurking on and off this sub for a little while. hi and goodbye to all of you lovely people. if i live, which is really gonna suck, then i'll update accordingly, looking like a real idiot. hopefully i don't see you all in september. best of luck to all of you.",0

"the doomsday clock is set.. hello redditors, first and hopefully only time i rely on a place like this. life story has enough content to write a series of books, but i'm not really going to file every wrong the world inflicted on me. just know i have no family to fall back on, don't even know the name of a single grandparent or cousin dead or alive . i've lost everything that mattered to me. i've been homeless, and i have been isolated from any valuable personal interactions for 6 years, minus speaking to useless psychiatrists which should've counted for something but in the end that and all the different medications i've been on never solved anything. told myself if my life was still going downhill after 5 years i'd end it, but i failed. it wasn't my first attempt. first time i was only 12 and leapt 3 feet onto concrete trying to go head first. now i've scheduled a time and place. until that time hits, i'll keep fighting and trying. i already suffer so what is more suffering going to do, end me quicker? sounds good to me. i've already done the self loathing on my ass until i lost my home. i got no one who cares for me and no one who will miss me. i mean this literally. if such a person existed they haven't told me the past 6 years minimum. this final struggle is for me, fuck you world. in the end why did i post this here? maybe so someone can relate, or maybe i'm just a human craving some interaction with likeminded people myself. but even that makes no sense to me the more i think about it... it's 3:3 am here in the dark, cold north... looks like it'll be another sleepless night.",0

"tired. i'm really tired. it's been a long time since i've felt like this but with my busy school schedule timetable, and my struggle to find a part time job, i've been feeling sucidical again. i remember on my 18th birthday, i promised myself that my mental health would improve and that i would go to therapy. but guess what, i'm 6 months in, haven't gone to therapy, and i'm feeling sucidical again. thus, i promised myself that if my mental health didn't get any better that i would kill myself on my 19th birthday. anyways i guess with that in mind it's a bit disappointing. especially that last month i was feeling a bit better than normal, only to return to the exact same track. money troubles have been on my mind lately, i have no idea how i'm gonna pay for school, or do well in school. why the fuck is life so hard? why is life so challenging? i wish that i grew up on some farm where nothing else exists. like seriously, am i like the only one whose like this? i'm so tired. i'm really tired, i really wanna quit.",0

"ive never felt so alone. this is my second time posting on here recently. i needed to get more off of my chest. my life in the moment doesn't look good. im very young and it seems since i am that i think super irrational about everything, and once i get older things will change. but honestly from what im looking at, things won't change. every time i turn around or recovery from a traumatic event, something else happens. the most recent one was my step dad passing away, the man i considered my father. he would've done anything to see me happy and now he's gone. my mom got strung out and left, leaving just my brother and i to fend for ourselves. luckily, we have an amazing grandmother that gave us our own place to live. but my relationship with both of them is bad. my grandma pushed me into starving myself, and my brother sexually assaulted me when i was younger. my grandmother consistently shames me, and only me she body shames both of us, but she only shames me about everything else . my brother has always been her favorite. it never really bothered me until she started invalidating how i felt because of him. every time we argue, its always my fault. everything is always on me. i have to be the strong one. i have to be the one to face our abusive mom when the time comes, because apparently i handle it. i can't, i just don't show emotion enough for anyone to realize how much im on the verge of suicide. every time we argue, it's always ""x can't handle it."" even though, i just got out of a mental hospital for attempted suicide. my brother has every opportunity to speak his mind, but i can't. even though, all he does is tell me how bad of a person i am all of the time. when the only reason im so agitated is because i can't sleep or eat. but apparently that makes me like my abusive mother, according to my brother. earlier i went with my grandma to go pick up my brother and i had just taken 1 benadryls so i was very tired, out of it, and agitated. he asked me if i didn't something to my hair, to which i replied with ""mhm."" when he didn't hear me i responded rudely, ""i said yeah."" which started an argument. he told me i was like my abusive mom, like he always does. my grandma took me to my mom's house i was staying with my grandma until i could move into our new apartment because they blamed me for the entire thing. which i know seems so miniscule, but ive been barely keeping it together as it is. my grandnma has always hated me since i was a kid. ive always been the one in the wrong. she never looked at me and thought this kid just needs someone to love them, she always just hated me. and she says she doesn't, but she makes it very obvious who her favorites are. it hurts because i just want someone to love me. and even before that, i tried to confide in my friend about being suicidal. they responded with ""uh damn, anyways im playing a video game."" they usually are pretty helpful and i know they are okay with me sharing these kinds of things with them, so this hurt. they've been so different lately and i know it's because both of us are barely hanging on. but after the most recent times they've genuinely hurt my feelings, i don't trust them anymore. talking to them doesn't feel the same. they were my one and only. they were my safe space. but now thats gone too. these things seem so small, but i don't know if i could ever put into words how im feeling right now. sure, my life has been full of trauma. but im tired of blaming everything on what happened to me. i don't need to talk about it anymore, i just need to feel okay. but after all of it and seeing the person ive become, im not sure thats even possible. ive been struggling with my mental health for so long and it's only gotten worse. i don't think i can do this much longer. i have no one to turn to anymore. ive genuinely never felt this alone. i feel so empty and im so tired of the mood swings every day. im so tired of the 3 hour breakdowns i have every day. im tired of becoming irrationally angry and ruining things for myself. im tired of not being able to sleep, or eat. im tired of constantly trying to fill the void with drugs, sex, alcohol, and people that i know will never be able to love me. im tired of burdening the people around me. everyone has made it pretty clear how much they dont love me, how much i burden them. i have nothing left here anymore. whenever i look around and see how many people hurt me or people ive ruined thngs with, i realize that im just a monster. everyone will be better off if i wasnt here anymore. i planned to kill myself on my birthday in 1 days, i think i might actually go through with it. anyways, i really needed to let all of that out. thanks for listening.",0
i want to end it.. it s not even pain anymore. it s dullness in my day to day life. i thought i met a special girl who is also feeling depressed and suicidal. we were supposed to uplift each other and be there. but she ended things and is emotionally unavailable. if i can t even make it work with her i can t make it work with no other women i don t want nobody else. but she was talking to other guys we tried to keep it casual but my insecurities got in the way. anyways today i lost all my money in stock options and lost her the same day. i don t want to live anymore literally. i m a fit guy and probably could easily find another girl and fuck your bitch but that s not what it s about. i want real love. my whole life i ve been shit on. i m just going to cock my g43x and pull the trigger tonight. it will be okay an end to the sadness. please love yourself and stay safe everybody as for me i will be at peace finally : ,0

"i don t want to kill myself, but i wish something could kill me on accident. and i don t think that s good . i don t think i would kill myself, but i find myself constantly wishing a plane would crash into me. or i would get hit by a car. i guess it speaks to how much of a coward i am because i don t want to have to do it. i want to not feel guilty. i don t want to eat. i either sleep too much or too little. to avoid life or because i can t stop my brain. i m exhausted, tired of everything. i feel like i ve already taken enough so why do i have to live. i know people love me but that s the problem for me. i have to keep living so they don t feel bad but i m suffering and exhausted. and i don t know what to do anymore. i am just so tired. why can i be surrounded by so many people and still feel so alone?",0
"stressed and depressed. that feeling in my stomach is back again. it's difficult to get myself out of bed. i feel alone. i feel helpless. i feel nervous to create new relationships with people, platonic, but especially romantic. i don't want to take the risk of getting hurt again. i just want to be alone. then, the loneliness eats me alive. i truly only have one friend right now, and that is my friend jessi. i can't hang out with her all the time. waiting for therapy appointments feels like forever. my parents don't ask me how i'm doing. they know i have ptsd from what happened. they refuse to understand what i'm going through. they think that i should just ""get over it"" or, if i'm experiencing depression, ""don't let what happened take control of your life."" mom, i found out my ex was a pedophile the entire time i was with him. so, yes, i'm going to be a fucking disaster for a little while. i just feel so weak sometimes. being in this house reminds me of all the years i used to suffer. i remember all of it. watching my mom attempt suicide and my family not being supportive of me for wanting to take her to the hospital. seeing her passed out on the floor from drinking too much. my dad threatening to beat her. my dad screaming at me for suggesting she was an alcoholic. watching her health slowly deteriorate because of the drinking. then, nothing is said about it. we don't talk about it. it just makes the pain that much worse. then, coming to the realization that if i told my parents that i'm bi, i could possibly be homeless. i just hope to god i don't become homeless. i worry about it every day. what if i don't do the dishes? what if they get angry with me because the bathroom doesn't look good? what if they find out i'm bi?",0
"im on the verge of really offing myself, life is too much . work is very stressful and i told them i was exposed to covid so they wanted me to take a covid test, cool. it took me a few days but i did it. the issue now is that the covid test isnt one of those that takes a few days and my job wanted me to take a test that was rapid i guess. im disabled with no vehicle and picked the best option. my job now wants to let go of me by tomorrow if they dont get results and i fucking swear to all above im gonna fucking kill myself. i gave my whole life to this job and they know im disabled and walked to the nearest place that could test me in 1 degree weather and this is what they do. it sucks to have been done like this my entire adult life. being disabled fucking sucks bc nobody treats you with respect, despite you doing your best to show that you too deserve a seat at the table. im sorry for rambling but im just at my fucking rope and its about to break ",0

"i dont know if i ll make it to monday. tldr: issues at home, issues at school, and a broken heart, are bringing me to suicide before school starts this monday. oh boy where do i start? well first my parents are in the middle of a split, my dads a cheater and he s mad mom caught him, but we still live with dad since mom couldn t afford to leave when we had my brother a couple years ago they made an agreement she stays home and dad makes the money my brother is special needs so he needs more of moms time and his birth was the start of my depression. the past couple years my feelings have been invalidated since he s a baby my feelings basically don t matter, nor do my mental issues since he s the special needs one. my dad isn t really present, he s busy working all the time and never really seems to try to actually listen to me, and he thinks money can replace the lack of a dad. when i started freshman year of highschool i met this girl who was like, just my type, we got along so well, then she dumped me right before my birthday, it s been half a year and i m still heartbroken. she s also my best friend, i try to be there for her in her times wher she feels suicidal, and i give her as much effort as i possibly can, sometimes it feels unnoticed, and that she doesn t really try much with me. i was manipulated by a guy who took advantage of my broken heart to do physical things with me, then ditched me when i didn t give him that. when i tried opening up to friends they made a joke out of it, i cut them off and told them how that made me feel and they blamed me for it, since they are also friends with that guy. schools starts this monday and i m freaking out becuase i won t see my best friend as much because she will be busy with the kids in her main class and i m worried she will like them better than me and we grow apart, the people in my main class don t like me and are extremely fake. the cherry on top is that there s a girl who s obsessed with me and trying to tarnish my name or whatever. she has threatened me multiple times and is calling me racist and an islamaphobe which doesn t make sense since i m mixed and a former muslim. i m extremely close to killing myself before school starts just so i can t go. i hate both online and in person school. i m surrounded by people who make me feel like shit, and i can t drop out either. i don t see a way out of this since all my happiness lied with my best friend when we were dating and all i want her love and comfort but she doesn t like me anymore so i m just sitting here, wishing i wasn t here at all. maybe if i were to die my dad and all the school people will truly realize how much damage they ve caused. only person id feel bad for is my best friend, if she truly cares that is.",0

"i don't know who else to ask. my f19 boyfriend m21 had his best friend kill herself around 6 years ago i'm not sure exactly how long ago because he rarely talks about it . to make matters even harder for him he walked in on her which has really had an effect on him. the day she decided to attempt she told my boyfriend about how she was struggling and that evening she sadly went through with her attempt. this is what has caused him major issues. he feels like he didn't respond to her cry for help, just telling her that ""things will hopefully work out"". he thinks that if he had acted differently in that moment she might still be here today, and is filled with guilt everyday. he normally only speaks about this when he is incredibly drunk, so i never get to hear about it when he's sober and able to be reasoned with. i always try to comfort him for example by saying he was only a teen when she decided to confide in him and therefore wasn't equipped with the knowledge he needed to save her, or that by the time she told him her feelings she had unfortunately already made up her mind, but nothing seems to help him. i know that there is no fix for this but i was just wondering if anyone had any advice to help him feel less guilty. do i ask him about it when he's sober? is there anything that i can recommend to him to start the healing process?",0

"i dont know what to do anymore. i feel pathetic writing this on reddit of all places. im suffering a breakdown currently and its very painful. ive been crying for two days straight and all i can think about is killing myself. i would do it in a heartbeat if i wasnt afraid of the pain. i dont like this, i dont like being alive. nothing is going right and never has and never will. posting this isnt going to help me. i need to talk or else ill really lose my mind and i want to be listenedto at least once. nobody has to read this it has no purpose or meaning nothing i say will ever have any meaning. i dont kno.w why but i decided to reach out to some people from my past and i was excited it seemed to be going well until of course it didn't last. good things do not last for me. i shouldnt have done it. this person is using me as a replacement for someone else much more important to them and it made me spiral. i dont hold worth. none of my words hold anything special to anybody my voice is garbage to everyone around me. i wish i had the guts to tell them i want to be listened to as well, to be asked about my life and my thoughts. i dont think anyone cares about me in that way. on this day, after realising why they were talking to me, my mind was plagued with self hatred. why is every decision i make the bad one? why did i ever reach out to anyone when im perfectly ok alone? i cried so much. i cried and cried and the people i live with never know i cry because i dont want to be a nuisance. but i couldnt hold it in. my pain leaked outside of me and it was the biggest mistake i could have made. my parent was upset with me for not telling them about a meeting i was having, i was going to tell them but my sibling did it before i had the chance to. after i calmed down a little i was going to. it led my parent to believe i was never going to tell them. i was already so deep into my breakdown i ended up raising my voice a little. i have avery quiet voice so it probably sounded the same to them. they didnt care about what i had to say. they told me they would throw away my food if i didnt go get it and i cried while eating it. i have not been hungry since. the situation made me feel like i was 15 again, like my whole existence was a mistake. i remembered that just because i am an adult now, doesnt mean they love me, it just means they can no longer abuse me like they used to. they have been ignoring me since then and its extremely triggering sorry for using this word . i have never felt so alone. they saw me crying and threatened to throw away my food. i wish i was dead. my other parent, when i first came to them about being suicidal, told me suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. i have never told them about my tendencies again. 1 years later, i am still suicidal, i still feel alone. i hate myself for opening the floodgates. i hate myself for thinking i could ever get better or have hope. i want to curse everyone out and punch walls until my fists are bleeding and broken. i have always had to keep my pain silent. the last thing i want is to be a nuisance. sometimes i feel like my pain isnt real because i've never taken medication or been hospitalised. ive only attempted suicide once and i laugh at it now, because it was so pathetic it barely caused any damage. i dont see a life for myself. i want to cry all the time so people can see how much im suffering. i want to be able to say the correct thing i want to be enough but im not and never was enough for anybody. i wish i didn't have so much hatred in my heart, but i wish my parents never met and never gave me my damage. i don't want to do this anymore. if god could give me one thing, it would be to disappear as if i never existed , so nobody mourns me and nobody is left with the scars of my death. another part of me wants them to hurt. i feel disgusting. i really do not want to be a nuisance to anybody anymore. im sorry if this all sounds fake or made up i dont trust anything i say at this point. and im sorry for the awfully long post.",0
"i want to die because i drove my friend away in 2 4.. i got angry with a friend of mine in 2 4, drove her away, realized afterward she was the only really good thing i had left. i've wanted to die ever since then, and i was never able replace her with a new friend who i could feel the same way about. if it was possible to forget my mistake, forgive myself or get over it, i would have done so at least 15 years ago. my mom died a few years ago too, leaving the whole world feeling completely cold and empty. i have no immediate plans for self slaughter, but i'm realizing i cant run and hide from my pain much longer. it has to end. i'm sorry.",0

feels like the end. my sister and niece told me to leave which at first i gladly did. she said she would help me but then after 2.5 months continuously yelled at me for not helping her enough. my dad came up here to help me and i can t be around him without fighting him. i tried but he triggers different parts of me and i couldn t take it anymore. maybe i am overall selfish and ungrateful but the levels of dissociation is making so much time pass and i can t face or fix anything. i m staying at a coworker s house which is so far from the jobs i had i had to quit. never being able to drive has been the worst thing i ever did to myself. i got my permit and tried and completely lost it. i just cant take care of myself. i m 22 and i can t do life alone. i know i need my sister and or my dad but i ve burned those bridges. i just kind of ran away. im pretty sure i have strep throat and one of them is in possession of my insurance card. i dont even think urgent cares take insurance from out of state. i know nothing. i hope going to get tests and antibiotics isnt too much money. is it worth getting a ride all the way to a walgreens cuz i heard theyre cheapest? is anything worth anything? the only reason im not killing myself is because my dog and all my stuff are here at this girls house and i could never put my dead body on someone. i know i m probably just being a brat. you know i was so excited for the life i was building myself at my sisters house but its like i took the soonest closest excuse to just throw it all away. i wish i could go back. she s like you think its okay i m in the dark after bringing you here? and it s like i m in just as much the dark and you told me to go so. i was nothing but a burden. i am nothing but a burden.,0
"i m trying.. i ll be 21 this month on the 19th. i m a daughter to 2 parents who don t know how to raise children. i still live at home because the rent here in california is impossible, but i ll be graduating from college next year in may and hopefully i ll have the courage and a little more money to try and get out of here. i hate living here. about a year and a half ago i completely stopped talking to my family. i completely just went mute. my whole life has consisted of my parents breaking out into fights over my dad s cheating, my mom takes it out on me, and then one day they just completely act like nothing happened. they have no fucking idea how confusing and damaging that is to a kid. to watch your parents have a screaming match, give each other the silent treatment for like a week, and then one day when i come home from school they re chatting over lunch as if nothing happened. this happened again 2 years ago the big fight. over the same thing. my mom tried to take it out on me and it triggered the fuck out of me. i couldn t believe this shit was happening again, and so i defended myself. mom didn t like that and she talked to my 2 sisters saying that i was ungrateful and whatever other lies she got them to believe enough for them to stop talking to me. my family except my dad don t talk to me anymore. i never talk unless i m at work. i don t have any friends. i don t plan on attending graduation because my family won t be there in good spirits. i don t know what i ll do after graduation. i don t have any hobbies because i just can t be fucking bothered with anything. i m angry all the time. just one glance at my mom and it feels like my skin is on fire. suicide has been on my mind for the past 2 years even moreso than when i was a teenager. i ve made specific plans, and i ve tried pills but it hasn t worked. but i try to get out of it. i do try to be happy. meditation worked for a while, but then i started drinking. i stopped drinking and been clean for a couple months now and i ve started going to the gym. the gym helped so fucking much. i remember back in june driving to the gym and thinking that i liked my life so much in that moment that i didn t want it to end for once. in fact, i remember thinking that i d be really sad if it did end right then and there because i actually had activities i was looking forward to. i don t feel that way anymore. i woke up yesterday at 6:3 am and immediately started crying because i did not want to be here. today i woke up and kept my eyes shut for a while hoping i would just go back to sleep because i don t wanna be here. i brushed my teeth and washed my face because that usually helps me get the day started. then mom shouted at me about slamming my bedroom door, which i didn t but she s in a bad mood she just wanted to pick a fight with her punching bag. i planned on having breakfast but the shouting ripped away whatever motivation i had for this morning. i don t want life after graduating college. i plan on moving out, even if i could only afford rent for a couple months, because it won t matter anyway. my last months will at least be spent away from the toxicity of my family. i ve tried to get better. i ve don t so much for myself and i ve rises from the toughest situations, but the motivation for that comes and goes. and rarely does it come. i have to force it. i don t want to force it anymore. it makes me cry because i have a little love for myself, and i don t like how i m treated. i don t like that i hurt myself. i don t like that this life is hurting me. i m so fucking tired. i walk around this house knowing i m not wanted here. you re so impossible to live with my little sister told me the other day. i literally don t even speak. they say that for happiness, you could fake it til you make it. but i m so tired of faking it.",0

"my boyfriend doesn't love me anymore and my mom is disappointed in me. in the last two years my mental health has gone significantly downhill. i used to be happy, i used to get up at 7: am every day, i was really talkative and idk. it's like i don't have a personality anymore. i've been trying to take care of myself but i'm at the point where i sleep until 12: pm because it's less time i have to spend conscious. i find myself intentionally starving because i want to look as gaunt and sick as i feel inside. the only thing i get out of bed for anymore is to feed my pets. i'm trying to get a job but it's so fucking hard because i can't see myself lasting for more than a year in this state. every second i spend conscious i think about killing myself. i cant have fun or distract myself anymore because as soon as i have a second to think i start thinking about how i don't deserve to be here and how much i've hurt the people i love and continue to hurt them every moment i stay alive. last night my boyfriend told me that i'm like a completely different person and he misses who i used to be. he feels like the old me died and it hurts more than anything. he said i feel like a stranger and he isn't happy in our relationship but he can't see himself with anyone else so he doesn't want to leave. just a few days before this my mom told me how much i was hurting her by being gay. she thinks i'm not going to make it into heaven and she started sobbing saying that she doesn't want me to go to hell. i hurt everyone who loves me and i can't do it anymore",0

i don t know how normal people can live a life happily.. i feel selfish like i make everything about me but i am hurting so fucking bad i just go numb now. i ve seen my father play russian roulette with himself. i ve dealt with drug addicts around me my whole life. in high school i met a amazing girl who s now my fianc after almost 6 years together now. i started getting out of my depression and moved forward got a decent job and had a jeep i loved and we got an apartment together. now all i do is work i don t have any friends outside of coworkers i only talk to on the clock. i can barely afford groceries yet don t qualify for any assistance. my jeep broke down and i m borrowing a car from my mother who constantly tries to help but will be passive aggressive after being the savior and acts like i m hiding money. lately i ve been so close to pulling the trigger. it feels like i can be happy for a couple minutes and a switch flips and suddenly i m not worthy of breathing let alone happiness. i always pull myself away from it but it s getting so much harder to hold on. i love my fianc and i want a future i don t want to hurt my family or her in any way but i m in so much pain staying alive. i m only 22 and everyone acts like haha yeah everyone s young and broke at some point but when you have a panic attack because you can t even afford eggs it doesn t feel like something everyone deals with. sorry this is so much and unorganized.,0
"wishing i could press a reset button. apologies if this post is a little long. i 26m really can t see how i ever recover from the situation and head space i am currently in. i feel so guilty for feeling this way and putting myself into the position because i ve had every opportunity to make something good out of life. i ve been to uni, got a first in my masters and completed my professional training. i ve worked for 2 of the biggest firms in my field albeit on low salaries and due to start at another top firm on monday with an average salary. i ve felt depressed consistently for at least a decade now, maybe longer. i will have good days but never really get to experience a meaningful consistent streak of them. i can t remember the last time i went more than 2 3 days without thinking about ending it all. i have thought about how to end it and planned how to on so many occasions. fundamentally, i know deep down that if i was to do anything i would just be taking the pain i feel and forcing it onto everyone else that knows me. i recently split up with my girlfriend of 2 years. this is the second long term girlfriend, both of which had been really good to me and been amazing people which i have decided to split up with. it s feels like i am trying to self destruct at times. once i finished uni i had some debts which took some time to sort but i managed to pay off. over the past 5 months since leaving my girlfriend, i ve fallen off the rails. spending above my means, drinking excessively and on several occasional booked last minute trips to try and get away for a bit. this inevitably has caused my debt to rise and now i am probably around 1 k in the red. this is highly embarrassing to manage in such a short space of time and feels so manic. i hadn t told anyone about my current debt or previous debt apart from my ex girlfriend, who again was extremely supportive . in june, i was staying at a friends, who had a big pot of ibuprofen pills. we d been out drinking all night and when we got back to the flat, i took roughly 3 of these before bed and had written a small note. i don t know if this was a genuine attempt or just a cry for help attention seeking. either way, i felt deeply ashamed and embarrassed. 2 weeks ago, my mum came downstairs one evening and found me crying so i decided to finally tell her how i ve been feeling all these years and about my current situation. i did not mention the pills due to shame. her reaction only made me feel worse as it came across as more annoyed that i hadn t said anything sooner rather than comforting. i used my last available money to fly to the first destination greece possible and haven t spoken to my mum properly since. i just got back home yesterday and have been hidden away in my room. obviously this just made me feel worse, more guilt etc. i feel like an absolute mess. i ve messed around my parents. i ve left the two most kind, caring and supportive people in my life on both occasions. i ll go days without texting my friends back because i m too anxious to go on my phone and they re all looking out for me. ridiculous financial decisions. all whilst having every opportunity to live a great life due to my education and work opportunities. i never thought i d actually get myself in a position to be so close to doing something which i know is silly but i can t see any other way at this point.",0
lets be honest. as depressing as it fucking sounds noone actually gives a shit about me im living a life of nothing meaningful if i would die without posting this not a single person outside my family would remember me and im not the only one everyone is basically me if not famous or etc anyways everytime i try to kill myself i get so scared but i really want to do it anyone know how to fix that?,0
"don't know what to do. i am 2 years old right now and been living in a chronic suffering for the past 4 years. it will be very long text, but i just wanted to take this off my chest. since childhood i had mostly an introverted personality. i hated this about myself, because i had always wanted to be much more social, but i had difficult times finding someone. i decided i would have more friends after i graduate from high school and attend a college. spend more time hanging out with my peers, traveling around and so on. that was what made me happy after all. i studied very hard and to my family's surprise, i got into top 3 in the state university admission examination, which meant i could pick any university with state scholarship. that was very blissful moments of my life but did not last long. my aunt wanted to me to marry her daughter and told my parents. my initial answer was, of course, a big no, but due to our shared family history with her she helped us a lot financially in the past , she wanted to forcibly make a marriage between her daughter and i, because of what i call ""curse of success"". after countless hours of conversation with my parents, i was very frustrated. i was 16 at that time and my parents were the only ones i trusted, and finally gave up arguing with them, which resulted in my loss. not only i am against relative marriage, but also did not like her daughter at all. i did not have any prior experience with any girlfriend so, for the past 4 years i have gone through some sort of pre hell with her. she was not interested in me either, and always had been very neglectful, negative, repulsive to me. due to the difficulty of my university studies, i was able to convince my parents to postpone this marriage for 4 years, but the inevitable would come sooner or later. during the 4 years i did my absolute best to prevent the marriage, everything i could besides suicide, but to no avail. you might be tempted to ask, why it is such a difficult problem. there are two answers: 1 it is frowned upon by our society when a girl is not accepted by a family and sent back 2 her father was a strict follower of society's rules and could do anything, i mean, anything even blackmailing us . it has been 2 months since this hell of a marriage ceremony and i am undergoing even more difficulties right now. we have visited marriage counseling for a couple of sessions what what the therapist said was she is not ready to take any responsibilities of a family, and i was affected by her neglectfulness very badly. i cannot take any steps back anymore. even during 2 months, there had been several big fights between us, because of her repulsive nature and my inability to withstand that. i respect her as a person, i do not have any personal grudge, but i also know we are not meant for each other. again and again, countless big fights and our parents, along with hers are against divorcing. her father is from higher ups, thus he blackmails to do something bad. at my age, my peers from university enjoy their life free of what i am going through. at my age, many discovers themselves, having great time with their friends or working on their future. but i am stuck with something i cannot reverse. i cannot focus building my life, but think how i could have prevented if i did not give up that day 4 years ago. all i think about is there is nothing i can do except for committing suicide, because of some shitty society rules. i have wasted my potential all these years on someone something that had no positive impact on my life, and i really do not know what to do.",0
"impulsive mistake. i ve been suicidal for a long time, but i had finally started to get a little better. i just moved into a new place, just got a job after a while of not working. and i wanted to get a dog. one that was already housebroken and relatively well trained, so maybe i could just have an emotional support animal i suffer from bipolar 2 and a panic disorder as well . but i went to this rescue shelter just to look at puppies, but they put me in a room and brought a medium largish dog in, and he s a good dog, but he s still a puppy. but i got him, and i don t know why i thought it was a good idea. my boyfriend and i are long distance, and he was upset that i didn t tell him before deciding, which is completely fair. but he said he s wasn t that upset cause the dog is cute. but, after that first night i realized how much this is going to be. i haven t even finished unpacking, and i stupidly spent what little money i had on the puppy so when i went to find a kennel which i thought were cheaper i panicked in the middle of the pet store. i m going to be taking the dog back. i feel like i m a horrible person for this. but i feel this is just too much responsibility for me right now. i have no free time anymore because i m constantly having to watch the puppy so he doesn t get into anything. i ve been incredibly suicidal and i feel like i d like to kill myself whether or not i decide to keep the puppy. my boyfriend is really upset with me, as returning the puppy goes against his personal beliefs but he says he still understands. but he s told me today that he can t really help me with this one, and he can t handle my flip flopping emotions because he s dealing with suicidal thoughts too. and i know that s kind of my fault, he had been carrying the weight of my issues for a very long time and thought they would be over or at least easier so he s let go so he can heal but, i just feel so horrible. i feel like i just make everything worse. i made a horrible decision by getting a puppy, i thought it would just fix my problems but that s not how it works. puppies are just,, it s just too much right now. i know he ll get adopted again so i m not worried about that, i just feel awful. i feel like i m a horrible person, and i honestly probably am. i m honestly considering just ending it after monday, which is when i can return the puppy to the shelter. idk.",0

"i used to be somebody. i've done things which i am so proud of, the realization of seeing an idea srpout from the ether into reality. this isn't a one off either. for example i've dabbled in writing fiction, creating an abstract strategy board game and other creative outlets. for perspective i'm a scorpio, born in a dog year.or a type 3 scorpio depending on how your look at it. suzanne white's ""new astrology"" pretty much nails my personality down. not that i'm letting these archetypes define me, i'm just offering context. for the past few years now i've barely been able to make it into work. theres anxiety about just dealing with people in general because i don't want to open up about what i'm dealing with. part of that is parenthood, and having a teenager going through their own struggles and essentially being helpless to help them. this is where anyone who wants to call me a selfish asshole for being a parent and being suicidal can dip. you don't know my story. around the same time frame of 3 or so years ago i was bouncing from place to place and had a landlord who was stealing my crap, and the next place was good until it was infested by bedbugs and that really fucked me up. i'm in my own place now, and lately i realize i'm just a nobody. i live alone, my friends have all moved away or adulted up into marriage or whatever, and i don't get out anymore. i used to go hiking and camping, usually with a friend and because of covid, finances or no social circle it just doesn't happen anymore. every time i reach out people tell me how fucking simple it is to just go out and meet people, like its magic. at work i don't want to open up when someone asks me how i'm doing because if i tell them what's really going on then i have to open up with backstop, reopening old wounds and honestly i hate feeling and looking weak. so i bottle it up. nobody knows. i'm just another lover who keeps to himself reading a book or watching something on his break.",0

"gonna kms after everfree nw. 4 months ago when i still had disposable income i bought a ticket to a my little pony convention. i only bought a ticket because it's close, i can pack a lunch and take the bus at very little cost and not have to worry about huge travel and lodging bills. lately money has been even tighter and tighter and i'm having to regularly take money out of my bank account to buy groceries on payday then go into negative when the bills come out a few days later or cancel automatic payments, otherwise i would not be able to afford food. i'm regretting buying the stupid ticket but there are no refunds or reselling the ticket is tied to your identity so i'm forcing myself to go even though i don't know if i will be able to have any fun there because i'm just so depressed. ironic because i am cosplaying the element of laughter. on the last day, instead of getting on the bus to go home again, i will run out in front of a bus that is going 4 mph or more. i read that you have a 9 chance of dying by that method. i like those odds. i practice witchcraft, i made a sigil that will garuntee my success. nothing that anyone can do or say to stop me so don't even try, just wanted to throw out there that i'll be going to this con, if anyone in the seattle area wanted to meet up and make my last days here on this earth slightly more meaningful.",0

"they'd rather me be a suicidal christian than a happy satanist.. i went to a rise against concert last night. a band who, on stage, condemned the rich, homophobia, hate speech, and nationalism. on the way in, a group of maybe 2 3 christians were proselytizing. holding up the signs saying we're going to hell. one had a microphone and a speaker and was just... going hard at us while we were just trying to go to a concert. i finally have contact with my dad's sister. but i've specifically not told her i'm a satanist. she was always super christian but liked rock music, supernatural tv shows, horror movies, etc. so i texted her about it laughing, because christians aren't supposed to proselytize like that. ... she said she's praying i am saved and don't go to hell. and she said this while ranting about my lifestyle, yet thinking i'm a cishet christian woman instead of a satanist, bisexual transman. i'm scared. i'm going to be pulled back into christianity from the fear mongering. and when i do, the countdown to suicide starts up again. i'm happy as a satanist. i'm living life. i feel free. but these people... they'd rather me miserable and then dead.",0

"just walking.. it s 5:37 in the morning as i m writing this. i m just walking through my neighborhood with a hurt foot thinking about everything i ve ever done wrong that has ever hurt anyone including myself. i am really bad at talking to people and i m really bad at expressing my feelings in any way without becoming a mess. i just spend every day doing nothing, killing the time every day until school starts up again and that will be a literal hell. i don t want to explain why because just typing the situation makes me incredibly upset, but let s just say i feel scared, misunderstood, incredibly upset, and like i m worth less than others. there is someone who makes me stupidly happy for no real reason, but because i have very bad social anxiety my brain really thinks that he doesn t care about me and that i shouldn t talk to him, even though he s said before that he does care about me and appreciates me. sorry that this is all badly written, it s now 6: 4 and i spent a long time trying to figure out words to make how i feel make sense. the reason why i m posting it here is because i don t think my friends would care that much, i m sure only a few people at most is gonna read this anyway.",0

"why?. why should i want to live? don t give me an emotional answer give me facts. i have no desire to live. i ve cut myself multiple times in the last week and have barely noticed the pain anymore. for the past five hours i ve kept a knife in arms reach. there is a box of 31 paracetamol within my reach. i m ugly, fat, stupid, immoral, lazy and borderline psychopathic at times. i ve got horrible hair and fashion sense, eat through snacks like an american, couldn t socialise to save my life, spend my time reading and gaming and watch videos of people being tortured to death with a laugh. the only way i see to get rid of the pain is alcohol and i can t afford that. every path leads to the grave so why bother trying to walk away from it? i m going to end up dead anyway so why go through all the suffering when i could just end it now? my death will have no impact, in time i will be forgotten and my death turned to nothing more than a statistic. my life has neither meaning nor value so why should i bother with it? edit: if i don t reply to your comment it s because i can t see it",0
"i need help. i don't know what to do. i need help. i have ruined my relationship of over 1 years over the tiniest of things. i lied about speaking to another woman. there was nothing going on with the other woman, just pleasantries and support as she had told me she was having a hard time. i know my partner is the jealous type, so i lied. i shouldn't have. it is my fault. that lie has irreperably damaged any trust that she had in me. this is bad enough, but there is more. i was recently diagnosed with brain cancer. i don't know if my lack of judgement was affected by the damage, or by the news of the diagnosis and subsequent depression. i don't think it was, i think i was just dumb, scummy and made the biggest mistake of my life. either way, this combination is excruciating. i cannot think of anything else. all i can think of is the hurt i caused over nothing and how even if i reconcile, i am likely to burden her with my failing body. i turned a nothing into a huge deal. had i been honest there would have been no issue, i have always been honest about speaking to other people before. i caused this. but even if i didn't, and everything was status quo, i can only offer future pain as my mind is eaten by the growth in my head. now i cannot live with myself. it eats at me constantly. i go back and forth between thinking about begging for forgiveness and just removing myself from the equation. then i think about how removing myself could inflict more pain and a downward spiral ensues. i literally have the drugs ready on the table in front of me. i pick them up then equivocate. then berate myself for being to weak to do it. this is the first post i have ever made, i don't know why i am doing it here.",0

"long rant i've achieved my dream life, and i'm on my way to suicide. marked nsfw because of references to sa and ed . apologies for the long post, i just really need to get it all out on a page, even if it's just for me. please feel free to scroll past. i'm in such a good place right now. i'm in my early twenties, making 6 figures in a cushy engineering job straight of college. i'm getting raving feedback from my coworkers, who are all rooting for me to get promoted. i'm eating three self cooked meals a day, good meals: fish, spinach, pasture raised eggs, produce in all the colors of the rainbow, you name it. i'm living in a luxury apartment with a room i've decorated how i've always dreamed i would, and i bought myself my dream car. i exercise regularly and get a good amount of sun and cardio with a dog who i love with all my heart. i've never been more certain that i'll commit suicide. i've always struggled with depression. severe depression at times. i've gotten close to killing myself at least three times suicide note written and sealed, door locked, knife to my wrist or rope around my neck . i've never done it because i was always convinced things would get better, but they never did. as a child, i was heavily abused both physically and emotionally. for trivial ""sins"" like eating too slowly or spilling a cup of water, my dad used to drag me into the bathroom, force me to strip myself completely naked, and he'd hit me until i couldn't breathe. if i didn't cry hard enough, he'd hit harder, and if i cried too hard, he'd hit harder because i was crying hard on purpose. almost a decade later, i can still remember the white rings that would wrap around his irises when he would yell at me, the way his face contorted. it would echo off the walls, his anger, his yelling, his slamming. it was endless. my mom loved and admired him wholeheartedly, still does. privacy was never a thing. if i wanted to listen to a ""pagan"" song, i'd have to print out the lyrics for my mom to approve. youtube was banned. the internet was more or less banned as well. if i wanted to hang out with a friend, my mom would have to have a dinner with the parents first. if i bought myself a phone or tablet, it would go on my parents' dresser every night before bed, and they'd go through it every night. my dad used to brag proudly about how if he found out that we liked someone, he'd tell everyone and make jokes about it and make sure we were embarrassed. so naturally, romance was never a thing either. i never got a break. i was home schooled for the first 14 years of my life, my mom was a stay at home mom, and my dad was a pastor who only ""went to work"" on sundays, so i was always within reach. i was never allowed to have a bad day. but complaints that they expected me to be perfect were scoffed at because they didn't beat me for other, more trivial things, did they? i remember being very young, curling myself into my closet, and writing that i wanted to die, that i hated my parents, that i wanted them to die, that something, anything would happen to make it all end. ironically, those were the happy years. or at least, the only years where i don't remember actively planning to kill myself. around 13 or 14 years old, i started growing pubic hair, so my dad stopped beating me, but by then it was too late. they sent me to a public high school when i was 14 because they saw it as a test of my faith in the lord the only test i failed lol , and as soon as i got there, i worked like a menace. by then, i was sentient enough to know that this was my chance to get to a good college on a good scholarship, which would be my ticket out of their house. i played the game. i took an unhealthy number of honors and ap courses, i joined asb, created charity clubs and got recognition from the city for my contributions, used no credit courses to boost my gpa, i was captain of my sports teams, played up to varsity, joined nhs, key club, all those scams. i was in it to win it. at home, i had to listen to hours of my dad screaming at my less ambitious older brother, threatening to kick him out or beat him. sometimes it was because my brother forgot his assignments at home, other times it was because he wanted to hang out with his friends when he had a b in english. it wasn't like he was a bad student. he was still a brilliant honors student with a 4 gpa. he just didn't care about perfection. and that was unacceptable. i worked myself to illness. i was getting an average of three hours of sleep, and i'd picked up the nasty habit of hitting or starving myself whenever i made a mistake. i'd stay up all night setting ridiculous standards for myself. i had to memorize a chapter of my textbook verbatim or i was undeserving of sleep. i had to hit a can with a volleyball in the dark or i was worthless. i had to complete a practice ap exam in half the time limit, or i was pathetic. i failed, i had to start over. if i needed water or sleep, i was weak. i got hospitalized for several days with a fever of 1 6 after a particularly rough finals week. my parents loved it. bragged about me all the time. it was the first time i'd ever felt valued by them. i began to think things could be okay if only i'd stay perfect. so the exhaustion and illness didn't teach me. nothing did. and in senior year, it finally caught up to me. with the pressure of the college applications, the last step to the final verdict, i couldn't take the possibility that i could fail. i began to plan my suicide. i'd already begun cutting regularly and alienating myself from my friends. my chronic self starvation and sleep deprivation certainly didn't help. on the day i planned to kill myself, i set aside the suicide note and the blade, and i was going to kill myself right after school. but by some miracle or tragedy, my favorite math teacher noticed something was off, and i was in an ambulance to the ward before i knew it. in the days and weeks following, i was bedridden. my parents were furious. they told me i was trying to guilt trip them. they told me i would go to hell. that i thought i was better than god. that i was ungrateful. selfish. stupid. crazy. then they would cry because they were worried. they sent me to a therapist who broke hipaa to tell my parents i was upset with them. they sent me to another one who ""really liked it"" when i wore shorts. i didn't talk to any of my friends. i cut myself endlessly. i skipped my meals. i would get up at random points of the day and walk all the way across the city and hope someone kidnapped me or hit me with their car. then my brother would find me, and back to my bed i'd go. i was caught in limbo. i had to make the decision. either i'd kill myself and stop the torture, or i'd fight on and try my hand at living in college and create the life i knew i could create. i wanted both outcomes so badly my chest ached. but i chose the latter. i picked myself up, forced myself to do the assignments, forced myself to ace my tests, forced myself through. i chose to believe in a better future. i chose to work towards that future. i graduated top of my class, albeit less gracefully than i'd hoped, and got into the ""number one university in the u.s."" on a huge scholarship with the most selective major, exactly what i'd worked for. i was ecstatic. i'd chosen correctly, hadn't i? i packed my things and moved into the dorms. it didn't take even a year in college before i was raped. looking back i can see it so clearly how it all happened. i was so excited, so hopeful. the people around me weren't the ""shady devils"" with cigarettes and raspy voices that my parents taught me to fear. they were academics. aspiring engineers who took ap classes and sat summer courses. people who like libraries. people of the same cut and mold as me... right? i didn't question it when my best friend offered me a snack with an innocent smile. and when the ceiling was swimming above me, and he was between my legs, it was too late to question it. afterwards, everyone laughed about it. called it ""crazy"" in that grinning, head shaking way all college adventures are reminisced on. this repeated itself several times, until i considered it a kindness when he'd fuck me without drugging me because at least i wouldn't get a headache after. it wasn't until i tried to resist him that it got violent, so it wasn't until then that i'd ever considered the possibility of rape. it wasn't like my parents had ever taught me anything about consent. and i hadn't been around enough people to know that the words ""i can't wait to see how i change you"" were a red flag in a friendship. when the big, violent rape happened, the kind that gets passed around in newspapers, it was too late. he and i were in the same friend group, and stepping away from him meant losing all my friends, friends who were in my dorm, in all my classes. i tried to talk to my rapist, but he wouldn't listen. i confided in one of the friends in the friend group that something might've happened and asked if it was something i should bring up, and he said i shouldn't. i woke up the next morning to find that all of them had blocked me on all social media platforms and were under the impression that i was going around, falsely accusing people of rape. when i tried to apologize, they laughed and said i should be glad i wasn't getting gang raped. i tried to report it, and the college did nothing. the boys found out i tried to report and told the ras i was threatening their health and safety. i was put into a year long investigation to see if i would get expelled. i almost killed myself twice. was hospitalized twice. was forced to make the choice twice. life or death? i'd already lost so much. everything i'd worked for in high school. college was ruined. my grades were suffering. my friendships were ruined. everything was shit. and despite it all, i chose life again. i chose to believe it would get better. that i could build things up again. then covid hit. i was back at my parents' house. they'd recently undergone a ""transformation"". my dad no longer yelled, and so i, of course, was under obligation to reward him with a deep father daughter connection. and my mom? well, she'd never done anything wrong, ever. my dad, after finding out i was raped, starting making rape jokes. if my dog would jump on him in greeting, he'd yell, ""me too me too "" my mom started saying i was prettier before i got raped. my hair was nicer, my clothes fit better, before. ""why are you so mad?"" they'd ask. ""why don't you spend time with us?"" and i'm rushing through this because this post is way too long, but given that it was 2 2 , it was bad. really, really bad. i chose life. i dug my heels in and reverted to my high school self. worked myself to ashes. yanked my gpa up. took 2 units a quarter. i dodged the expulsion and graduated a year early from college with honors and a job lined up. with my picture in a slideshow and my diploma in the mail, i packed up and moved away. i moved away, and i built the life that i have now, my dream life, and i am miserable. i've developed delayed onset ptsd. i have vivid nightmares of shit as far back as my dad yelling at me for taking 2 mins to eat a meal. or plain old flashbacks of being raped. i smell weed and remember the weed on my rapist's breath when he was raping me. any time i go to the office for work and i'm surrounded by my all male team, i have intrusive visualizations of them gang raping me and of my parents finding my mutilated body and making jokes about it. any time one of my teammates says anything in a slightly altered tone, i'm terrified. i'm struggling with ocd and perfectionism that has only worsened since i've moved out. i have an awful, impending sense of doom when things aren't ""just right"". i constantly doubt myself, put myself down. i stress about work until i'm shaking, and i check and recheck everything i do. my manager loves me and says all my teammates think i'm incredible, that i'm super smart and helpful and make everyone's lives so much easier, but i wish they didn't notice me at all. i feel like i'm expected to be likeable because i'm the only non man on a team of roughly 2 men who are all at least 7 years older, so i can't get away with not being likeable, but i don't know how to be likeable. i'm terrified of them. i don't trust my own tongue. none of my jokes or words come out right, and i sound all wrong. i worry about being too ugly to respect and too pretty not to rape. i don't know how to make friends. i've forgotten how. i'm scared. i don't trust my own judgement anymore. i don't know what the rules are. if i'm being annoying. if my laugh is too strident. if i'm asking too much. if i'm accepting too much. if i'm giving too much. if i'm giving too little. how often to make eye contact. what the hell i'm supposed to talk to them about. i feel like there's a certain way that people live when they have friends. they form their thoughts like they're things meant to be shared. they develop hobbies with room to breathe, with ways to invite others in. they read books with discussion topics in mind, with the desire for others' input and the assurance that they will receive it. between my isolated childhood, my traumatized isolation, and covid, i have rarely had occasion to think this way. if someone asks me what i think of something, i have thoughts, and they come out complete, polished and sealed, with a beginning, middle, and explicit end that rounds the conversation off and shuts it down. i don't know how to foster a conversation that promotes discussion. i don't know if i ever have. and at this point, i think it's too late to try because everything inside my head is defective or broken or desperate, and i cry far too much to make any friendship pleasant. because i moved away from my home, away from my abusers, i am also separated from everything familiar to me. all my high school friends are dispersed across the country. i connect with them digitally through social media, but i think they're getting tired of me. i send too many things to them, respond too eagerly. it's pathetic. i am so lonely. i feel myself spiraling again, and i know this time, this is it. if i fall apart, my job, my independence, my autonomy, my options to flee if my rapist shows up at my door, everything. everything is at risk. and if i fall apart again, what am i supposed to do, choose life again? choose to work for that better future? for what? i've learned by now that the phrase ""life gets better"" isn't true. yes, life will get better, but then it gets worse again. far worse, before you can even recover from the first blow. life isn't a fucking movie where the one big bad thing happens and the protagonist just has to work through that, and then the music changes, and you know it's over. there is no music telling you it gets better, there is no one big bad thing, it's just life, brutal and volatile and long, and you are stuck in it for the rest of your life. i'm starting to get the sense that suicide is just a logical conclusion to a life like mine. i've had so little control over my life, i feel like the very least i can do for myself is give myself control over how it ends. and i know all the statistics about failed suicide attempts, but at this point, i don't care. it's not that i think my suicide would mean nothing. i know there are people who love me, who look to me for help or inspiration. but how much more do they want? haven't i given enough? i tried so hard. wasn't it enough? if not, then will there ever be a point where i've given enough? if not, then am i really the problem? it's not that i think life won't get better. i know i have it in me to make life get better. i know that if i wanted to, i could push forward and make myself something incredible. or just make myself content with being pleasantly mediocre. but for what? to get hurt again? to lose again? to watch everything i've worked for fall to pieces again? i've proven myself, and i am tired. the only thing that keeps me going my dog and a stupid shred of hope that i am wrong. i am doing all the right things, feeding myself well even when i want to starve myself, i am exercising, drinking water, sleeping, going outside in hopes that i can at least make it long enough to support and love my dog until he dies. but i feel myself slipping slowly. i relapsed on cutting after over a year of being clean. bought myself nice, sharp cutting blades too. i dropped my therapist when the company screwed up my insurance and acted really shady, and i don't have the energy to look for a new one. i am two poorly timed disasters away from giving up completely. i am so bitter and angry that i am realizing this now. i wish i'd killed myself in high school. i am so wrong now. every inch of me, every cell of me, all of it is wrong and far too touched, but not touched enough, and i will die this way. i feel delirious and sick. i want to laugh it's so foolish. i'm so foolish, sitting here in my nice, expensive apartment that i comfortably afford, typing at a fancy computer, away from my abusers, well fed, safe, with a stable career, typing about how sad i am, how sorry my life is. why am i not happy? why am i so miserable? why can't i just get over it and shut up? i know why, but i wish it didn't manifest itself in this way. i'm tired. anyways, if you read through this whole thing, you deserve a gold star and to do something that makes you smile, so make sure you go and do that. and if you have any words of advice, i'd appreciate it, but no worries if not. thanks for sticking through it : . edit: fixed wording and spelling",0
"i don't think i'm going to survive this. i've had depression all my life with long painful bad episodes, but this current one doesn't seem like i'll make it out alive. i've been reduced to a shadow of my former self and i really liked myself. it's heartbreaking to witness me disappear. and i've put up such a fight, i've reached out, i checked myself into hospitals, i struggled to find a therapist. i have nothing left. my friends all think i'm getting better and have stopped asking me how i am because i do a decent job at looking like i'm on my way out of this episode. i've spent lots of money to meet them i only have long distance friendships but even that doesn't make me as happy as it once did. i've lost interest in my biggest passions, i feel hollow. i'm not sure when it's going to happen, but i can sense that i'm on my way to taking my life and i've ran out of ways to stop this. when i die, it won't be because i hated myself or didn't feel appreciated. multiple systems have failed me. i'm just another statistic.",0

"my brain stopped making it seem hard. i ve been like this for over 12 years now, just a little under half my life. at one point most of it was just a messed up brain, then my life started to nosedive completely. so many deaths, so many hospitals visits, breakups, friend loss, and absolutely no feeling when i accomplished anything. i have friends who love me, i have a partner who loves me, i have a lot of great traits but this cloud still exists. i tried everything under the sun. just powering through it, therapy, meds so many meds in the last 2 months that i started randomly showing bipolar symptoms . but it s just not working. my depression got so out of hand for the last year that i spend most days unable to leave my bed and can t work or do any hobbies. every day feels more and more like rock bottom. im usually used to it, but for the last 6 months my brain is no longer making it seem like ending my life is a difficult thing. i sat with a sheet around my neck ready to hang myself not caring who would find me or it would impact this is typically my reason for not doing anything to myself and now my brain has just been telling me that the bridge is only 15 minutes away. it s just one jump and all my problems are done. its telling me how easy this tutorial to make a hangman s knot looks and to go up the highest fire escape and make sure i snap my neck. it feels like my only barriers stopping me from doing it are eroding and i feel every day im just one slightly bad moment away from finally doing it. and it is sometimes an even worse feeling than what originally got me here. to know ive tried for so long and i feel this close is terrifying",0

"almost killed myself tuesday night. i had relapsed with selfharming a week earlier after 13 months of being clean and almost killed myself that night as well. then tuesday night, at work, i decided that once i finish my shift. i would kill myself. i knew exactly where and how i would do it and what my final words to certain people would be. a manager realized i was off and didn't let me leave his office, making me sit down which made me just lose it. the moment i sat down, i completely broke down, just a mess of tears and sobs. one coworker called 911 for me and i was taken to the hospital. i've been discharged already and am back home. but a part of me, a large part, still wants to kill myself. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up again, i just can't see a future for myself and haven't for years now, i just want to be dead. i don't care anymore, i don't find happiness or joy in life anymore, i don't want to keep pushing forward through life, i want it to be over.",0

"i don t know what to do anymore. i ve been struggling with depression for years now and i ve tried to end it multiple times. adhd and ocd haven t been helping to say the least. both of these have been detrimental to my grades last year, and i don t have high hopes for the next. currently i have one friend, and my absolute inability to make new ones is keeping that number at one. about two months ago, i got a boyfriend and he was super nice to me. during the next month and a half my life was so much better because of him. but then he discovered my political opinions were the opposite of his, and although he hasn t directly said it to my face, it is very clear that he doesn t care about me anymore because of that and will probably break up with me soon. not to mention he knows literally everything about me, which if revealed would ruin my life. i m yet again feeling like it s the best option to kill myself, however i m being held back by the thoughts of my family s sadness if i did, and my dog waiting for me to come back and slowly forgetting i exist. these thoughts only add to my suffering. i haven t told anybody about this until now, what can i even do anymore. because i really really wanna die.",0

"i'm losing... every day i wake up it's either by anxiety or lethargic. tw. just in case. i'm honestly sick of being consistently invalidated because i'm either ""too young"" or ""i'm lying"" especially of my difficult upbringing. it doesn't help that even though i've been diagnosed with asd, i've had people tell me off that i can't be autistic because i'm not r slur or i have ""functioning"" limbs said by normal people and some men on the spectrum their reasoning is that because they're autistic themselves while making misogynistic comments and it grinds my gears the most that they use their autism to make such comments to avoid repercussions while i get double standards? i came from the philippines and i moved to the us right before high school and it baffles me how the most racist people in that school garnered a large social following that everyone just watched them throw food at me on the bus and i tried my hardest to not get violent because i was months from graduating, finally leaving that ghetto ass county and i was already threatened of getting sued and beaten in the philippines they didn't sue me but they had their kids beat me up as a way of ""atoning"" . i'm sick of everyone. i never once fit in and the few friends i had were only out of convenience. i know i have a bad habit of overexplaining but i'm working my hardest on it while ashamed to admit how i've regressed from all the trauma i've been through, especially after i was finally out of the house. even though i was a victim, it's hard to think of being one due to how i was consistently beaten that ""i'm never a victim"" especially with the blessings we received. i admit my life turned a 18 when my step dad dated my abusive mom. i went from living next to the slums to a gated townhouse when i was 7 but i was miserable growing up in that townhouse because the times my abusive mother was home, she'd beat me till my whole body's numb with either a belt or a wooden stick or stuff that she'd command me to get from her room and if i wasn't fast enough she'd throw that object from combs to cutlery especially knives and throw me out of the house on other nights and when i continued to cry, she'd yell for the guard half across the neighborhood to wake them up but the more people watched, the more i get beaten. it didn't matter whether we were at a mall or at home, at least behind closed doors, it's less humiliating but is it any wonder why i don't want to leave the house anymore? she and her family still wonders. i'm just done. i have to keep my schizo a secret to everyone who knows me because of how little they already see me being autistic and how ignorant the common denominator are with mental health, but every day i always feel like i'm losing a war and i'm scared of failing again only to be punished by getting 515 again for losing control. nobody understands me, what more cared because nobody ever tried to listen to anything i have to say unless it's something they want to hear yet i'm the bad person for walking out or why they fucking feel especially guilt. i'm just oversummarizing all the shit i've gone through at this point and it already reads like a dissertion now so i don't want to say any more of the shit even my therapists have told me seem ""too horrible to be true"". idk english is my 2nd language and i was just lucky to learn it young because it was mandatory in my country's private catholic school. idk i never want to hear or see the people from my life ever again but as i get older, i feel more left out because this world is just ableist af. i didn't just witness it from my upbringing but also having to watch how everyone treated my uncle with severe cerebral palsy.. i at least will try to make it for his 1 yr death anniversary. even though i'll never be able to go back to the philippines, i kept your tombstone in my memory because that was the first time i got to see your full name and birthday. you were the only one to stand up for me against your sister and i'll always carry with me the guilt and anger of not being able to be there for you more. even though i've been to a handful of funerals growing up, it was your funeral the first time i felt.. different. at that time i didn't know what grief was despite thinking 17 meant i should be more mature.. at least when i'm gone, i managed to burn bridges with everyone, especially my abusive family because i know my narcissistic mother will never be satisfied until she buries me just like she did to my uncle, her own brother. if my abusive sister is reading this, if ever. since not once did you ever wonder what more ask why i blocked you for 2 years? because you blackmailed me about my abortions because your shitty parents couldn't talk to you like a normal person without yelling at us. whether it's me or them, you always had a condescending tone yet you blamed me for your childhood when everyone was at your beck and call, but i don't blame you because i was the family scapegoat while you were the golden child i was the failure while you were the investment , everything that went wrong, it was all my fault. the fact that you took great offense of me just staring blankly as ""glaring at you like a pest"" didn't trigger me but telling me that ""mom has changed so much while you haven't because the past was the past"" just triggered me and in some ways, i'm thankful. i'm finally free. honestly, i'm glad she probably won't be able to read this because she doesn't remember from her toddler years how our abusive mom laid her hand at her for wetting her bed because she was 3.. not once did i ever see my abusive mom help her with her potty training because she had me and ellen the maid to do all the ""gross"" stuff she wouldn't do. plus the times her parents fought alot especially when we just migrated to the us. but this is a few among others i'm taking with me to the grave. so last post. i was raised beside her more as her nanny than ""sister"" because what should my shitty mother know about siblings when she's the adopted one yet not once did she ever let her own brother sit on the same dining table with her. my step dad is sexist that he only really cared for his son while ""girls are just too much drama"" then wonders why no woman respects him because he's attracted to abusers. sure he could've been worse but he nearly got arrested for being an enabler. so the fact they can still be smug just proves how perfect they are for each other. if i was such a ""liar"" then why the fuck did my own mother try to kill me especially more so during my adolescence ? not because she wants to bury all the shit i had to witness for her? all the shit she says behind everyone's back. yet i'm the bad person for cutting myself off from my shitty family because not once did i even once think i was ""good"" because i was never good enough for them. no. they always reminded me how i'm the worst pos that she wished she never gave birth to all because why? i was ""difficult""? literally i had signs that i wasn't like most kids but i never saw that, instead she just reminded me that i was a failure. i only wanted to end the cycle of abuse that i tried to escape. at least i'll die without them ever knowing what more ever hearing from me again. i don't need a funeral, fuck i don't even want one. i'll just stay 27..",0

"disheartening experience posting here not long ago. hey folks, just wanted to pass on a disheartening experience i had here not long ago after posting about passive suicidal ideation about financial issues, lack of identity and lack of motivation. the gist of the post was a bit of a rant, but truthfully, i was looking for someone to talk to... some validation... i don't know. a few minutes after posting, i had a user post a reply along the lines of the following: ""you are fucked. just end it. maybe you'll do something right for once."" now, i understand trolls post with throwaway accounts every now and then, but i still can't fathom why someone would say something like that to another human being. lately, my suicidal ideation has been vacillating between passive and active, having recently been hospitalized for a week following that post. has anyone else experienced this sort of abuse posting here before? i've never had this experience before posting on this subreddit, but thought i might give some other folks a head's up in the meantime. i reported the profile if my memory serves me but hearing things like that is very upsetting for me, as someone who has been told to ""kill myself"" to my face by another person when i was much younger. very disturbing that someone would come here just to say that to another user in need.. seems sociopathic. in any case, just wanted to pass this on. hope you all are alright.",0

"an ex, who i no longer love, made me break down at work, without being there. any idea why?. i m18 work at a retail store, it s the kind of place that you can go hours without seeing anyone. i work entirely alone, no one but me runs the store, it gets very lonely and it s recently been very mentally exhausting doing mundane tasks and having no human interaction. today i was pricing and putting out new clothes, it was a sweater of some kind, however it had this smell, the same smell my first serious girlfriend had. we dated for 5 years, most of middle school and half of high school. i loved her, and i guess i still do, but it s not the same type of love anymore. we broke up 2 years ago, since then i ve had other serious relationships, none of which have worked out. i no longer care for her too much, she changed a lot during our brake up and after. she was not the same girl i fell in love with. before she dumped me she became toxic and started to give me trust issues. for weeks i would get anxiety about whether or not she loved me still, it affected me then, and it continues to affect me now and had an impact on my later relationships. when i smelled that smell today, i smelled her. her natural scent. it s not a bad smell, just a uniquely recognizable one. it immediately brought me back to those days filled with anxiety and insecurity. tears welled up in my eyes and my heart and mind were going a million miles an hour. a couple minutes later a customer walked in and i had to push my emotions away so i could muster a smile and a welcome, how are you? oh i m doing great, thanks for asking, if you need any help don t be afraid to ask. while they shopped i kept muttering under my breath for everything to stop and go away. it didn t. when the customer left i locked myself in the bathroom for 15 minutes until i calmed down. i know this is a lot to take in, but does anyone have any advice or why this happened? i should also mention that i have never experienced anything like this ",0

"i'm scared to die, but i feel like it's my only option. i was forced out of my home by a minor fire the only damage was wiring and the back patio and my life has been a living hell for the past 2 months. my family lost around 3 4 of our belongings because our landlord only gave us 2 chances to get our stuff and we couldn't get any help to do it. my mom and i have been staying with her friend since the fire but we've overstayed our welcome there and will be kicked out any day now. i've tried to get a job to help rent another apartment but it feels like a lost cause. i can't find a job because i can't overcome my social anxiety. i'm not qualified for any good ones because i fucked up finishing high school. i just feel so useless and my mom always makes sure to let me know how useless i am too. no matter how much i've helped her around the house, or listened to her vent or walked her to whatever appointments she's needed to go to. the world revolves around income, and because i don't have one, i am basically a waste of space. i don't know where to go from here. as i stated earlier, we're about to be homeless. i already lost one cat because she had already escaped through a window by the time we were allowed to get our stuff and we're in the process of surrendering our other two cats due to our upcoming homelessness. i just can't take all of these shitty things stacking up while knowing i can't be anymore than a burden. if i don't have a plan by the night we have to leave, i'll probably attempt suicide that night. if you made it this far, i appreciate it even though you probably think i sound like a massive bitch. if anybody has went through something similar or has any advice, i'd appreciate that even more.",0
my end. i ve decided that i will end my life today. social anxiety has made my life hell i ve been bullied throughout all school years i was always the weird kid i didn t speak with anyone and whenever i had to speak i got nervous i started stuttering and just not making sense people found this amusing but i didn t every day i got home i cried i had and still don t have any friends im always silent. and i m not just saying this i actually mean it i have no friends and never had any friends i was never liked i thought that maybe after school it would change and when i work maybe then i will make friends but its still the same. although i m not getting bullied at work i have still heard them make fun of me saying i was a creep and strange and it really hurts. i wish i could be like everyone else they all have fun they talk with each other with no problem meanwhile i can t even say hello without stuttering or panicking. i don t leave my home besides for work of course. all i do is work go home and play video games or sleep and on my free days it s not any different. my parents never cared about me really and since i moved out they seem to have forgotten i even exist i m only 19 so i can t say i have experienced much but what i have experienced is terrible for me i feel like i wasn t meant for this place i feel like i was misplaced or something. and since my rabbits have passed my life has been getting worse they were my only friends if you can count them i talked to them i told them everything and now i am completely by myself. but it doesn t matter i am sitting at the beach right now its dark i will listen to few songs i like and then just swim out as far as possible until i drown i will be forgotten and hopefully never found. none of this matters in the end i just wanted to feel like i told someone before i go i guess my heart is beating very fast and my brain is going crazy right now so it feels. i wish all of you a happy and wonderful life you deserved it all of you : ,0

"i'm confused. so i just created a new account to post this even though none of my acquantances friends actually ever followed me on reddit. english is not my main language so excuse some errors here and there. for privacy's sake i'll say i'm 2 , rounding up or down some years, and i'm male. i don't know when it started or why my memory always seems to fog up faster than everyone else's but my vision of the world was always a little sad. don't get me wrong when i was a kid i do kind of remember being happy, but i also remember opening the window that faced the street i was living on and telling my mum that if i wasn't enough as a kid maybe i shouldn't have been born note: judging by some clues left behind in my memory i'd say this episode happened multiple, innumerous times since i was at least 7 or 8 years old i wouldn't say i was hated back in elementary school but i definitely was bullied back in middle school. let's say i kind of got my shit together and pulled through patching things up here and there and almost enjoying my last year there. high school was weird: i got a girlfriend i got my bestie still going strong to this day and i got absolutely destroyed in the process here's where i want to make one thing clear: i do consider myself to have friends, and these friends have sometimes shared intimate issues with me so i do feel like i was useful. yet that's just it. i only feel useful to others. i find my life to be completely void of meaning. every time i interact with someone i set myself up for exploitment. to be honest it's rather hilarious to think about but my spirit animal is probably a front porch rug just a flat surface that says ""welcome"" to clean your shoes and be forgotten about when it rains outside. i broke up with my girlfriend right as covid struck. the relationship felt toxic to me and i felt like i was made a fool of. i don't want to point my finger at her, may someone bless her soul and may i never see her again. the thing is everywhere i go i feel used and never fulfilled. it all starts with me helping someone. the possibility of them relying on me for something is intoxicating. it feels as though that will validate me. and i hate this perception of love i have. it makes me fall victim of so many unintentional exploits. i pass more time helping others than helping myself. and i don't even have a standard. i don't know if i'm bi or just crazy. but it's becoming unbearable. i can't allow myself to be used by everyone and still have feelings for them after they don't even recognize my presence there. i just see gray. i help others, get home, realize i'm not fulfilled, get forgotten, cry, wake up, repeat. i keep waking up and checking my phone for messages that arent there. i fall in love with everyone so i dont really fall in love with anyone. and nobody loves me, or likes me. i'm sure my friends would go for weeks without realising i have passed. in a way i feel like i already have proof. every time i'm with someone i dissociate, it's just too painful to know you want to die when you're trying to be useful to someone. and even though my will to live is zero i still commit myself to the burdens of others as if that is going to make me a different, better, saner person. and so i go back to my bed. wondering if i'm ever going to finish my studies before ending it all. wondering if i'm ever going to go back to my psychologist as my bestie who just knows part of this story suggested. telling myself i've done enough today when instead i feel like i'm just waste nobody deserves. no one will miss me. my parents are disappointed in every result i bring back home and never fail to make me notice. i've got a wedding to attend to in some weeks so i've been holdin on as to not ruin it, but i don't know how long i can keep going just on inertia. haven't felt happy in so long i just know when i'm not feeling the sadness vs when i am. that's it, just wanted to post this here since i'm lost. and to whoever's reading this: have a nice day : ",0

"really starting to get this learned helplessness thing.. my parents know that i m depressed. not suicidal. but depressed . their very first snap reaction to me telling them was to say that it s because i m on my phone too much. which is super funny. actually. eventually they let me know they would help me find a therapist. still working on that. hard to find one apparently, so even though i m admittedly in a very fragile mindset and experiencing dark thoughts, my parents will still tell me about every single thing i do and am that bothers them. even though i m struggling and some of the things are a direct result of that. for example, i did something that my mom found annoying, that my dad did as well. my mom never confronted him at all, told me that she was annoyed with him but didn t want to deal with him so didn t mention a word to him. but she laid into me. even brought up that she doesn t want to make me feel bad but felt like she needed to be heard by me anyway. i completely over reacted and broke down crying, which surprised her. and embarrassed her because we were driving to go pick someone up and now i was crying. i don t know how she is surprised. i m literaly, depressed. and not treated for it yet. and tonight i was a little drunk and ended up admitting to my dad that him and my mom were the only things i was living for, the only things in my life that i was staying alive for. he had no reaction. just kind of muttered about that being stupid , but no real reaction. then changed the subject. so i haven t been sleeping. like the past 4 weeks there have been 2 3 nights every single week that i haven t slept a single hour. just pulled all nighters entirely. and it s really been dragging me down into some crazy darkness i ve never seen before. i ve told my parents this. in the past my doctor told me that if my sleeping issue gets worse that she is going to have to put me on some pretty serious sleeping meds. so tonight i let my dad know that i ll probably be put on those in october when i go to the doctor. and he didn t show any concern at all, all he showed was annoyance . he told me that if i worked really hard during the day then i would sleep just fine. i told him no that s not the case. i m not sleeping in a much more extreme way than just, not being tired. he told me if i got up early and then worked the entire day and night that i would sleep just fine, i pointed out that last year for 8 months i worked 2 jobs, and would get up for 6am shifts and would work either til 9pm or 11pm, and still struggled with sleeping. which he knew. and he huffed and asked if i did that for 2 years ? and no i did it for 8 months. but i struggled sleeping. he huffed that i wouldn t know until i did it for 2 years. by that logic i wouldn t have any right to complain for a very long time. since i m 23 and have only legally began able to work since i was 16. so, about 8 years i ve ever even been able to work. maybe he ll take me seriously when i m 36? i told him that i always ended up regretting telling him the things i struggled with because he always found a way to downplay them or make them my fault. and he walked away and went to sleep. i really truly wonder if i took my life in this bedroom and they found me tomorrow would they wonder if they were somewhat at fault for not taking me seriously, or would they act as if they had no clue i was struggling. if they would regret snapping at me for stupid things. for hearing that i m not sleeping and not caring. for hearing from my own mouth that i hate myself and instead of helping, doing their own work to tear me down more. to seemingly agree that i suck. i m so sick of asking for help man. i m so tired. i don t know how long i can be the only one helping myself.",0
"i m so fucked.. i can walk up to anybody. anybody at all in my life, tell them that i want to kill myself with fully sincerity and they.. will not do . anything : i can post on my snapchat instagram story to 1 people. a picture of me looking like shit, directly saying i want to kill my self.. and nobody.. will say..anything : i can go to therapy, talk to a therapist sure.. but nobody want to hear me talk about my bad experiences in therapy and they insist there are better ones out there without fully understanding the hurt that comes alone with breaking that trust.. it s like i m a second thought to everyone.. people hear that i have a problem and they deflect it as soon as they can onto someone else.. nobody cares about me.. why should i? i keep thinking about killing myself, but i m not sure i even want to i want help and to get better.. but i don t even know what better is i m so misguided and poorly raised... i feel like i ll never survive on my own unless i fix this stuff as soon as possible.. i can t do it alone anymore.. i ve already went through my trauma alone.. i don t want to have to deal with it alone too.. not in a world where everyone around me fucking preaches about kindness and being there for others it s sickening especially knowing they know, and they still do nothing it s too much for me alone as i said.. the trauma itself is too much but then to meet this amount of opposition when i try to get help????? it s crushing i m not usually one to take the easy route but it s becoming more and more tempting lately and i think about it more and more every day this all goes on.. i tried to reach out so many times.. only to be ignored and forgotten i don t know what i need at this point.. maybe a hug. but you guys can t do that so..",0

"most people probably want me dead anyways. throwaway for obvious reasons cw: csa, violence, pedophilia i'm 22m and have been depressed and suicidal since i was around 12 years old but have had anxiety since i was very young. i've known i would be the one to take my life as long as i can remember. i'm not sure when but when i was probably around 5 or 6 i was sexually assaulted by a few teenage girls which i never told anyone about and seems to have left me with serious issues. i remember seeing bras at the store and wanting them for some sexual reason i didn't understand because i had no clue what sex even was. everything about it seemed to interest me though. i remember my parents watching a crime show and there being a girl who was abducted and tortured and something about it seemed to excite young me. i wound up discovering porn on the internet around middle school and quickly became obsessed with it. i don't know if it's a normal reaction for most children but i wanted to know what my peers looked like naked or having sex and searched often for that type of content. thankfully i never found anything. unfortunately though i never seemed to grow out of that interest and still the idea of seeing a minor sexually interests me. i feel disgusting for it and know that it's wrong. i tried sating my desires for it with fictional depictions but never felt truly satisfied. i hope i would never act on it but i'm always fearful of losing control of my mind. recently my thoughts have become more violent too as my brain struggles to cope and deal with complex emotions. girls make me feel angry a lot of the time. a mix of jealousy that other people can have sex with them and that they get to look so cute and attractive. recently i've fantasized about even taking the lives of some of these girls. i don't even know what i'm writing anymore. i just need to get things out of my head. it's hell being stuck in here and i just want this to be over. i feel like most sane people would agree it's probably best if i wasn't in this world",0

"life is frustrating and nothing has gone right, despite all the effort i've put in.. i want to die so, so badly. i've been plagued with mental illness my entire life one way or another i had severe ocd as a kid, which ruined my childhood. all i could think about were rituals, how i could avoid certain things, and how to hide my compulsions. that eased up when i got older, but i've always been deeply depressed. four years ago, i developed pmdd, which is pms x1 . every month, i feel hopeless, suicidal, anxious, i'm angry, i'm impatient the last two qualities are not a normal part of my personality . im pretty sure i lost some friendships because of my deep depression. i'm lonely as fuck. last year, my boyfriend, who i lived with, broke up with me because i gained weight during the pandemic. he was so fucking mean to me after he broke up with me. we lived together for a month after, while he was looking for a place. and he treated me like shit. he also went on dates off of dating apps while still living with me. and i was still in love with him i'm definitely not now . he thinks i don't know. he got into a new relationship three months later and he looks so happy in pictures he's posted on instagram with her i've since blocked him . that hurts because i remember being sad he didn't post any pictures on instagram of me when we were together. people always bring up ""karma"", but it's not real. if it was, he would be miserable, for what he put me through some of which i didn't mention here , and i'd be in a happy relationship.i ended up losing almost 3 pounds last year, after he broke up with me. but a doctor had me go on birth control to help my pmdd and i gained it all back last november. i'm having trouble losing it again. i don't want him to know anything about my life because i'm so fucking lonely and i weigh the same now as i did when he broke up with me. i feel so pathetic. after that, i essentially lived alone for months. my parents very kindly bought a place where i live so i could rent from them i had to move three times in three years, the first place was because my landlord was selling the place so i had to leave, which i had a hard time with because mentally, i can't take instability. i pay them market price for rent, more than i've ever paid for rent. it's not a free ride, which is totally fine. they bought a two bedroom because living alone makes me suicidal. i was so excited to get a roommate and have someone to talk to sometimes. but i ended up with this guy who i cannot connect with at all and i call strangers for my job all the time not a telemarketer i'm good at talking to all sorts of people . it's just so awkward when we interact, and he's gone a lot anyway. i'm extremely resentful of him, especially because he makes these odd noise complaints i had to work on a sunday so i microwaved oatmeal at 6am, and because it was his day off, he came out and complained i opened the door before it went off and made sure to be quiet. he leaves at 6am on weekdays for work, but i don't complain because i have a roommate who needs to live their life too. i had to watch a tv show and take notes on it for work and i was in the living room at 1pm on a sunday afternoon and he texts me, from the next room, to turn the tv down. it wasn't on loud the narrator was louder than everyone else so i had to turn it up a bit. a few hours later i apologized not sure why, its a reflex and he said ""i realized that maybe the noise was coming from the pool area"". he didn't apologize, and if i didn't send that text, he probably would never have admitted the pool thing. i'm not a loud roommate in the least bit, but he'll incessantly use the washer and dryer a few weeks ago, the dryer going off woke me up at 3am. but honestly, if he did all that and we actually had a friendship and talked some times, none of that would matter to me. i can't ask him to leave without anyone else lined up because my mom will yell at me and guilt me, like she always has. but his presence is making me depressed as fuck. i resent him because i wish this spot was filled by someone i could talk to sometimes. i work from home, which is isolating, so i'm alone all day and all evening every day. this is honestly just a little bit of why i'm depressed. if i wrote everything, it would take up more than the character limit, i'm certain. i had two grandparents die in less than a year, i was sexually assaulted last year, a guy i liked a lot, who i met last october and had regular contact with, told me he didn't want to hook up anymore, and wanted to be friends without benefits, which was shitty but okay, i have to accept that. he hasn't texted me for more than a month now though. a lot of my friends moved away during the pandemic. it's been harder for me to leave the house after the pandemic, psychologically. i don't know how to make new friends here. the pmdd is actively killing me. i tried to kill myself last year because of it. i don't have any control over anything, but i'm fully aware its happening. it's like this person who isn't me is in my body with me, and they're making decisions and saying things, and they're much stronger than me so i can't fight them. if i just had someone i could actually have a household with and sometimes maybe we can watch a movie or cook dinner together, i feel like that would help. i don't need them to be with me 24 7. i like and need alone time. but this is too much alone time, and it's genuinely driven me insane. i know this all pales in comparison with what other people have to deal with, which makes me feel like an asshole. i tried so fucking hard to fix everything in my life after it fell apart during the pandemic, and i essentially have made no progress. i wish people in my life knew how fucking hard i've tried. i'm sorry this is all over the fucking place. i have truly lost my mind because of all of this. i just want to fucking end all this pain and suffering. i'm tired of people treating me like shit. i just want to be free from my fucked up brain. i'm so fucking frustrated that nothing has gotten better in over a year, even though i tried so hard to make it better. i wanted so badly by this time to be thinner, to live with someone i enjoyed being around, in a happy and loving relationship, with a fair amount of friends. i told myself last year everything was going to be better by now. what do i do? just say everything will be better by this time next year? how many years am i going to keep doing that without seeing improvement?",0
"cw: suicide and details of it. i m finally at that point again. tomorrow i will be getting an eviction notice because i can t do anything right like simply working to have general things i need to have to live an average life. my therapist gave me a list of organizations i can call that could help me cover the rest of my rent so i don t have to get evicted. but if i can t find one to help me tomorrow i m just going to end it. i don t ever like asking for help because i don t want to keep being a burden. so asking for help with my housing situation feels so stupid because i m just taking that away from someone who actually needs help because they want their life. i feel bad though because that means my family or someone else will have to go through all of my belongings to get rid of them from my apartment since i d be gone. making them have to do that feels shitty but if i m dead it s not like it even matters. i don t even have anything to give away because the only thing that mattered to me is gone. plus i know my cousin would love to have my cat because he really connected with him and wants a cat anyway. as for my other cat, no one knows i even have him so he d probably end up at a shelter but he s such a pretty cat that i know he d find a loving home pretty quickly. his breed is sought after. plus maybe selling all of my squishmallows and other electronics will help cover some of the costs of my death. i m just over it, i can t seem to stop sabotaging myself since forever. plus i have people that hate me so much they d love to see that i killed myself because that means they won. but really it s me who will have won. i never thought i d be alive this long. i didn t ever want to be alive this long. but here i am. i don t want to live on this planet surrounded by disgusting human beings who don t give a fuck about anything except themselves. even if that means killing our earth and putting other people down. as long as they get money that s all that really matters. because then they can experience cool things and make good memories. i don t want that though. i ve never wanted it and it just feels so stupid to me. i never understood the appeal of living life by doing things that make you happy having children, making all of these great things. in the end everyone will die so why is it so bad for me to want to leave on my own accord? say i went to a hospital to get help, i d still lose my apartment and my job and my family would still have to pack up my belongings. and after that? they d be happy i m here but still disappointed that all the help they gave me didn t do anything to make me want to live and do better. they d have to take care of me again even though they can t. i will always be a burden because i can t do shit on my own because i don t care enough about myself to want to help myself. and they can t change that. i don t think anyone truly knows how dark my brain has been since i was born. i ve done everything to be this perfect person so that my family would be proud of me, but that s just not me. and i can t keep doing it anymore because that s all i ve ever done my whole life. i don t have any fight left in me and frankly i don t care enough to appease them anymore. i m just done. so we ll see what happens tomorrow i guess. if you actually read this then thanks for coming to my ted talk.",0

"i want to be loved. it's all i've ever wanted. i want to feel close to someone, i want to be able to trust someone. i dont trust easily, in fact i don't trust most people, i hate almost everyone without even getting to know them, the few people who i do like i tend to make space between us, i idolise them, only to then make myself hate them when they do the slightest thing wrong, i also tend to take everything to heart. i don't make friends easily because of my judgemental and often shy appearing personality so i just try desperately to fill the evergrowing void in my chest. i can't even hold a proper conversation, i'm disgustingly awkward, i can barely ever string together more than a couple sentences and even then i struggle severely. however, as much as i hate and struggle talking to people i crave love and affection, it's something so foreign to me. my parents never said ""i love you"" or hugged me growing up and i think that a part of me feels very emotionally and physically neglected. i hate physical touch, i hate the thought of someone touching me yet i cry myself to sleep most nights wishing someone would just hold me in their arms or hold my hand. that's another thing, i've never held hands with anyone before, i've never kissed anyone before, the most i've done is an awkward almost hug but not quite. i think i'm just severely touch starved. i imagine the warmth from someone else's hand, must be so comforting, must feel so safe... i wish more than anything that i could have someone who loves me. unfortunately for me i seemingly can't have platonic nor romantic relationships. as the days go by i can see everyone start to hate me more and more, my friends become closer and i'm left behind just desperately trying to catch my breath. i can see it in their eyes when i talk to them, i can see the pure boredom in their eyes reflecting my face. they're not bad people, i'm just boring. i'm still in the ""main group"" i still get invited places but i always feel so alone, they're all just so much closer to each other. i try so hard to be funny and make everyone think i'm fine but it gets harder to keep up that facade. i'm so very tired of this, i'm tired of constantly feeling on edge, i'm tired of always pretending to be happy. i miss the person i used to be. i miss being obsessed with a tv show or movie and telling all my friends about it, i miss having hobbies, interests and passions, i miss being able to simply be happy. i wasn't always happy, i felt sad, angry, upset, embarrassed too, just like everyone else but back then i wasn't being constantly drowned in a pit of sorrow and self pity. back then i had the energy and social skills to talk to people and make friends, go places, etc... everything deteriorated so quickly.",0

"i am an incel piece of shit. for context: i am male, i have an average looking face, i am 2 years old, i have a feminine skinny body, i have a small dick 5.8 inches , i am short only 5 11 and i am poor. i have never been that good looking man the women have loved and cherished. i have no social life and am probably autistic so people think i am weird when they meet me. i have a good family which is amazing for sure. but thats the only positive to my life. i realised i was an incel 4 years ago and my mental state gets worse and worse each year. i have been led on for attention by some girls in the past, been so close yet bad luck happens and the worst of all something catastrophic happened to me in february this year. i lost the one woman who actually seemed to give a shit about me. this woman was amazing she was actually an 8 1 and i couldn t believe my luck. she showed she cared and was concerned about how i never ate food. we dated then my insecurity of her ex 6 4 29 year old good looking boyfriend made me feel inadequate and the incel beliefs told me that she is alpha widowed which means he will always be the best she ever had. not me. i had sex with her for 7 seconds but my dick went soft due to my nerves and compulsive porn addiction. then i went on to blow the chance and end up getting blocked by her. after this rejection i went further into the incel space. i continued to lose weight and the worse of all i became misogynistic and envious of women. i got jealous because i saw how every woman had men willing to have sex and intimacy with them: something i was deprived of. i also saw how women are in such high demand and felt inferior to them. i also hated how some men paid for everything in the relationship and took it in a way where i feel like women live life on easy mode obviously i understand even with this help, life probably isn t easy for even them as life can be shit to anyone but i feel like if i was a woman life would be a lot better. luckily i am not a terrible dude. i keep to myself and dont want to be the typical hateful incel to kill innocent people. i just want myself to leave the world. back to dating. my dating life would improve if i had a big dick, was 6 4, black i feel like black men are the most sexiest to women , good looking, and had money. i know less than 1 of men are this man but i feel like thats what you need to have a good dating life as a man. sure missing one of these traits wont mean its over. but in my situation being average it is over. moving on a solution to continue to live would be: eating well, gym, staying away from incel spaces, making money, drop jealousy, becoming as best looking as possible, working on my mindset. however i feel like even if i do all of this, women wont want me as they have access to plenty of better men on dating apps.",0

"i wish there was a way to truly erase bad memories.. the first few months of my year have been a fucking write off. even though it's hopefully getting a little better since may, i still keep thinking about a very bad period in my life and it stops me truly enjoying things even now. i can't wait till this year is over and i just want to forget everything that happened before summer. and i'm sick of this shit, people telling me my bad memories are important and i can learn from them. fuck that. i want to forget. all of it. i watched eternal sunshine the other day and i wasn't a big fan of the film but i love the idea of it, just being to erase memories completely. and what i felt during the start of the year bled into everything songs i listened to, places i'd go, and things that were special to me, how just been tainted and i can't fucking enjoy them now. does anyone else ever get that feeling? this year i've felt tiny, insignificant, scared and pissed off and angry all at the same time. i just want to say that if there is a god, i'd tell him i'm not impressed at all.",0

"i don't want to do it in a way that hurts anyone. i've had a plan in place for many years, where no one would be affected. not even strangers. i was almost ready a couple years ago. everyone was gone, there was no one left that would be concerned about my disappearance. then i accidentally fell in love. now that's all been destroyed and here i am alone again. even more lost and isolated and confused and broken than before, as if that was possible. but i know she'll blame herself. there's no way i could possibly make her understand that i'm not doing it because of what she did. i'm just... going back to what i was doing before she came along. so now i'm stuck, waiting for her to drift away enough to not notice. wallowing in pain while i wait. i have a garage full of my old life's shit that i have to sell this weekend. a storage unit full of my dead family's shit that i can't afford anymore. and now a van full of my shit from ""our"" apartment that i have nowhere to put but need to return the van. i just wish i could die in my sleep of natural causes and not have to deal with any of this. i'm overburdened with responsibility to people who no longer exist in my life. but good news i'm very ill anyways and part of the reason for the plan wouldn't end up being able to take care of myself eventually. i wanted to have a plan to take care of that while i still had the autonomy. but now i have covid and a severely compromised immune system. i've barely slept or drank and literally haven't eaten since sunday. can't keep anything down. can't breathe very well between the coughing, crying fits, and dry heaving. my fever is getting pretty bad. i still can't sleep. so i'll take some valium and a little nyquil. nothing fatal, just to fall asleep... and maybe there's a pretty good chance i'll stay asleep and she'll get a 33k surprise since i just opened a life insurance policy to split between her and two other people that aren't in my life. that wasn't the plan. but it doesn't sound too bad.",0

"advice for why a teenager who's body gave up on himself shouldn't k ll himself. hello , i am 24 years old. since my last depression was greatly reduced by jp. and after all psychiatrist help did not work. i have come to this sub and possibly get a view from you people. a short story of my life is after failing the first try on uni and realizing my 1 years of league of legends playing did not gave me any openings because i was bad at it. i have lost all my ego or trust in myself. even though i had heavy adhd i have pushed myself through and tried again. after failing to go into a good universty in my country . i went into an offshore uni where i did not learn anything and lived in poverty. after coming back into my country found a job thanks to a family connection while working i have found out i had kidney failure on both my kidneys. but i have believed in myself and work through it with high medication. i had a stable life where i studied went to gym and worked. after a year the medication cortisone caused both of my legs to get avascular necrosis.on top of that i have developed a gaut and as a man who did not liked to eat any veggies and possibly throw up if i ate it. now i am pushed to a severe diet. following after a 6 months of surgery and recovery time i have lost my job and i got advised to not lift any weights. please do understand that i am not a hot male i and i have an upcoming 3 skin tag https: tureng.com en turkish english skin 2 tag on my face . so now that i have no jobs no skills qualified and no natural beauty standards. i have a very hard future that is awaiting. on this point in my life all of my trumps has failed and i just left a 24 years of failure behind. i did promised myself at age 18 that i would kms if i did not improve on life . now that 6 years past and got no kind of advancements in life and only worse medical status . i am contemplating the only option. i have no future that is awaiting for me that can make me happy nor i have any kind of dreams or options that can make me smile. even if i magically turned into a millionaire and got new kidneys. https: kidneys.got with an existing gaut and surgecially weakened legs i do not be using any of my money to do things that i like. so far any things i liked is a turned into a severe failiure realised that i had no skill and passed my prime age of doing it. b now due to my medical status i am not allowed can't do. i have speak this about my family and total of 1 friend but they both couldn't said anything and just said ""cmon don't do it"" as the doctors i have went. no one gave me a good option, hope etc. the only realistic approach was ""you have to realize your positive things and live a life happy with what you got"" which does not stand in any way shape or form.due to me not loving the idea of a ""failure who is born to fail living in poverty with weak health status"" since the future that awaits after my family dies. is an ugly, alone out of shape dude who can't even lift run jump that lives so he can go to dialyses. even if i had these options i would not be gaining any muscles due to kidney failiure. and since i do live in a 3rd world country where my life means nothing. i do not wish to continue. so can you give me your opinion. why shouldn't i ? or what would you do in my condition ?",0

at what point are you considered an 'immediate threat' to yourself?. thinking about opening up about being suicidal to my counsellor however not sure how much of the truth would be best to say as i really want to avoid inpatient. i have heard many people say that you won't be put in inpatient unless you are an 'immediate threat risk' to yourself but i'm not sure what exactly is classed as this. if i'm suicidal and have a plan and a loose idea of a date does that count as an immediate threat? i should also mention that since i'm under 18 and i've heard that this makes being forced into inpatient more likely. i do really want to avoid this at all costs as my parents finding out would be enough as it is. does anyone with experience in this know the criteria for being an immediate threat?,0

"where to post or show ""suicide note"". i wrote currently writing a really long one, like basically just a summary of all the reasons i want to die and why i'm killing myself i have a muslim arab family who i don't have any sort of relationship with and would never want to , and the idea of writing one ""in real life"" is out of the window for many reasons. this past year has been the hardest year of my life and every freaking day feels like it's my last. each second i live feels like i'm getting closer and closer to ending it all. and the idea of writing a ""suicide note"" or anything similar to one has always just been something i wished i could do. because my entire life i've always just daydreamed of venting to someone about all the reasons i wanna die, and the things i wished i could say before i die, and how much i hate this world and why. but i have so many reasons, like basically an infinite amount, so realistically i never thought of writing one. but since i'm really really ready to just end it all, i said screw it who cares. because even though i definitely won't express myself correctly or even fit 5 percent of the reasons i wanna die, i'm gonna be dead anyway. so why does it matter. also the text is really long. like realistically over 1 thousand characters so yeah basically i don't know what to do with it. help please. i don't know what to do this is an edit but literally neevr fucking mind. 5 of teh stuff on there is kind of political and 4 of it is why i hate people and hate this world. and peopel are gonna read it?? makes no sense nobody will relate or even understand me and knowing how much im fixating or eveyry little thing scared of how im saying it because i feel embarrassed maybe i shouldnt show it to anyone in the first place. i told my family im ex muslim and this ""suicide note"" thatsbasically like a mini diary i showed to my aunt and dad to try and convince them into not calling the mental hospital people thing idfk what theyre called which didnt even work and now i am quite literally stuck so even in a hypothetical situation i didnt wanna die im gonna die anyway. i havent drank water in two or three days idk at this point cuz i havent slept and in three days max ill be dead. i cant risk any other methods os dying. i fucking hate this world so much i hate everyone and everything. this world is not my place. i was born in the wrong time and wrong place. i was never meant to live. i was born as a human to be dehumanized. i fucking hate this world so mich",0
i can t do this anymore. i was meant to be dead over a week ago.. but i couldn t do it because i was meeting up with my crush. he feels nothing towards me yet i feel so obsessed with him it s killing me. my suicide notes are written. my will is written. i have everything planned out. i ve been depressed for 7 years. i don t wanna keep going when no one wants me here. it s killing me so much..,0
"help. i made a previous post here 2 3 years ago i'm currently 16 in that time my life has changed so much and not for the better, i've gone to rehab a little over a year ago due to my drug use nothing more than weed pot marijuana and the occasional drink and in my time there i've realized so much about myself people there help me realize that yes drugs aren't the answer to not having to deal with my problems, i still have a lot of passive suicidal thoughts but recently the past year and a half i've had more and more active suicidal thoughts. for some back story my father has always been abusive physically and mentally when i was about 7 9ish cps got involved nothing came of that but he did finally stop not because cps because although we live in the us my fathers side of the family comes from laos around the time of vietnam, and they are very respected in there community and he stopped because of the repercussions that having his kids taken from him would have but he is still emotionally abusive along with my mother. my father has lied about the abuse to cps my family friends, my mother gaslights or tries to tell me that i always deflect the blame for anything onto my father because i mention his abuse in arguments and trying to get her to see how much that has affected my life. i have now realized even as a 3rd grader i suffered from severe depression anxiety. but more recently me and my father had a fight that stemmed from me arguing with my sister, i called him out for not doing anything beyond going to work 7 5 while my mother also works a fulltime job and doing all the house work along with me and my 2 younger siblings 15,13 i have 2 other siblings but they are 8 and 5 6, but my father complains when nothing is done and how it stresses him and my mom out while he sits on his ass and does nothing, i also go to school, have a part time job all year round and most of the time i could go to school, come home and have less than 2 minutes to take out and care for my dog, and get ready for work, then have to come home and still be expected to do my evening chores i don't mind doing all of that but he whines and complains that nothing is done while not doing anything himself. but during the fight i had called him a ""lazy piece of shit father who does nothing"" and that is what triggered him to be beyond pissed and i had been holding my dog who in the first place does not like me at all while having the argument but my father had proceeded to walk and stand no more than 3 inches from me and just said ""hit me"" he has tried that in the past so he could hit me while it being 'self defense' he also had a camera that would show i hit him first but the last time he did that i hit him and my mom stopped him from hitting me at the time 13 and he told me ""next time i will leave you on the ground in a pool of your own blood. after that i shoved him and told him to ""step back before i do hit you"" and i went to my room and slammed the door and part of the wood trim came off just needed to be put back and nailed back in and my mom came in and started to defend him i had used my body to push her out of my room and lock the door and then called my aunt to come pick me up, she showed up to my house about 5 minutes later to get me and my mom had tried to stop me and i once again used my body to push her out of the way and once i got outside my aunt was talking to my dad and i had gotten into her car and then waited for my aunt to follow but she stayed to try and get the story of what happened, no less than 3 minutes after getting in my aunts car 1 after another 4 cop cars pull up no siren, no lights and i told the officer what happened and included the part of his threat when we last had a fight. i had spent the last 3 1 2 weeks at my aunts house with my cousins occasionally smoking weed while there and 2 days ago her neighbor had texted her about a ""weed smell"" and my cousin her daughter 23 asked me if i could stop and i said yes because i didn't want to cause troubles for my aunt and her family so i said i would stop and tonight about 4 hours ago had gave me an ultimatum of i either go home or she will call the police but not to just make me go but search the house that would also get my aunt in trouble even though she didn't do anything nor do anything illegal and so after about and hour of me standing in my aunts kitchen and staring at the wall i don't talk to my parents after the fight while my father sat there saying nothing my mom is currently trying to get a divorce while my mom sat there and threw insults at me and blamed me for things out of my control. but to the point my mental health has gone down and down due to this and i have had about 4 active suicidal thoughts a day each thought is there for about 1 2 hour and has been in a downward spiral and my mom only throws some pills anti depressants and basically tell me to deal with it. and i can't be here it gives me flash back most likely from c ptsd and if in honest the only thing i care about here is my dog different from the one earlier stated and i'm starting to things that the only way for me to be happy is if im dead and all i want is for me to be happy but i have to live with the person who most likely is the cause of possible c ptsd and my mom defends him all that i'm told is that im a disappointment why am i not better how i can't do anything right. all i want is to be loved. to be happy if this is my last post then i hope everybody else can handle them self's",0
"how do you help someone that doesn't want to be helped?. hey guys, i was recently told that my brother tried to commit suicide a couple of months ago, but my parents decided not to tell me about it on his request. he tried then realized what he was doing and stopped and seaked help from them. i don't live in the house since i turned 18. i am extremely worried. he finished school, he left uni, he doesn't leave the house, he sleeps during the day and played computer games at night, he is severely depressed, he has no wish for life, he has no friends, no goal in life, he doesn't work, he doesn't go out of the house, i was told he hasn't been out for more than 3 mouths. he doesn't want to speak to anybody, including me and we used to be close, he only speaks with my mum. he doesn't want help, he doesn't want to talk, and he doesn't want to do literally anything to get out of this situation. my parents have left him alone for now for him to calm down in general and not to trigger anything more. you have no idea how much i've tried to help him, to be there for him, to search for a job, to try to get him motivated to do things, i've helped him out a lot but he doesn't want to do anything. i'm shit worried, my parents are unable to handle this situation, they lack the emotional tools to do so. i don't know what to do guys. how the fuck do you help somebody that doesn't want to be helped? ps: he refuses to talk to me, he doesn't answer my calls, and he removed me from social media. but that is not only me, he did that for everyone. he only speaks to my mum. i have no way to come in contact with him, when i visit the house he doesn't go out of his room and it is always locked.",0

"i don t know i feel lost. about 5 years ago in the middle of the night i had the thought to cut my wrist with a big kitchen knife. i remember it vividly. i was living with my grandparents because that was the year i graduated and they had told me to come stay with them. it was so lonely and i felt so numb. something had stopped me maybe the thought of my family losing me so i couldn t go forward with it. prior to that i ve always had thoughts about killing myself but never going through with it. recently i ve been having suicidal thoughts again and i, i m just tired and i ve been tired for so long ever since i was a kid i ve been trying to stay strong ever since middle school and i haven t told anybody close to me because what s the point this world is so fucking shitty and majority of the people are cruel. i ve thought about therapy but i ve heard that most therapists just use you for money or and i honestly don t want to take medication because i don t like to put pills inside of my body. i just want to know how long would it take before my mind takes over and goes through with the thoughts i ve been having.",0
"i am probably damaging my daughter.. been researching the effects of a suicidal parent on a child and it s as bad as you d probably expect. higher rates of depression, overall worse physical health, poor academics, high rates of emotional neglect. my partner recently told me that they didn t even think about suicide as an option until they got with me. that they learned this behavior and thought process from me. that means my daughter will too. beyond the suicide, i m also extremely fat. i have tried so many times and i just have no self control. i try to make sure she has healthy options for snacks and i try to make her balanced meals but how much does that matter if she sees me being disgusting outside of the table? i recently started self harming again for the first time in probably 1 years. like a teenager. i ve done fine hiding it from her but how long can i get away with that? i think she might be better off without me. i don t even believe that this is suicidal fog or whatever. i genuinely think that i am actively harming her and i don t know how to stop beyond killing myself. she would be so much better off with a step parent and not even remembering me. i feel so sad to think of all i would miss, but it s even more sad to think i would harm her to the point of being like me. i love her so much and i would never wish this on her. it feels selfish to stay alive.",0

people can mentally hurt you with no punishment. it's so annoying how people can just constantly hurt your mental health and you legit can't do anything since you are already feeling down and if you even try to get them back in some way you are most likely to be punished there really is no way out if just will get worse and worse till we end are lives where still no one will be blamed for the cause of our death,0

"i might not make it till tomorrow. little backstory . since i was little i have dealt with some several mental problems self harm, eating problems, anxiety and severe depression, among others most of them have been medicated for a long time. my parents pressure me that if i get 9.6 it's not good because someone got 9.9. if was gaining weight , if i don't do an activity my cousin does, if i do a lot of things and that they don't have my time,if i eat or didn't eat. my friends, although without knowing it, make comments about ""i eat and i don't get fat"" or ""no op is super judgmental "" for saying that she has beautiful eyes ""op this or that"" my family compares me with my cousins and demands that if i'm good at something and my cousins isn't it's because i'm selfish and i don't help them enough. .there were times when i felt fine and suddenly something triggers my depression or eating problems and sometimes relapse in my self harm. recently during the pandemic i tried to overdose myself, it didn't work i woke up on my bathroom floor after several hours with a horrible headache very low oxygenation and heart rate i don't know how i survived. shortly after, a trip to the er for my heart rate i was almost hospitalized for my eating problems, i won't go into too much detail as it still triggers me. this was in a pandemic, i had a relapse and then i started university face to face, i tried to occupy myself as much as possible, which only made me about to die due to my losing weight, i had my second attempt after having a panic attack in the middle of the parking lot while i was buying party decorations with my father and i decided to stay in the car since i was still shaking and my dad thought it was a tantrum for not wanting to get out and he proceeded to tell me how selfish, embarrassing, ungrateful daughter i am . recently less than a week i had my third suicide attempt that i almost succeeded in if it weren't for some friends i didn't go into much detail with them i said it was accidental and they believed me. i just can't take it anymore i feel that maybe it would be easier for everyone and for me if i died, my parents wouldn't spend money on me, my friends wouldn't have to put up with me, a few free hours for my psychologist that someone who needs them could use. it would be good for everyone if i wasn't here anymore . and yes for me it would be like turning off a tv suddenly dark that's what i like to believe i feel like it's easier just to take a knife and cut my wrists si if this thoughts don't go away i will not make it till tomorrow",0

"this is what dubai is for me.... this is what dubai is for me... last year i decided to left france and start a new life in dubai. after 22 years of careers through military, firefighter, paramedic, policeman, teacher, consultant... i decided to left this crazy, country of racists, homophobic, close minded and aggressive to restart a new life. in fact, i've been harassed by the director of the fire department who never accepted that i married a transgender from philippines. i'm divorced now by the way. after i sold my house and resigned my career i traveled 13 countries in europe, south america and middle east. until i found dubai. during this time i use all my money in trading and forex and i was almost millionaire. homeless but comfortable situation. later i.lost everything because of new waves of covid. doesn't matter i still have a good health, my arms and i'm a genius i mean high iq . so i decide to restart here. i bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3 a month. time for me to settle down a new life here. my miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. everything was fine until may. on may 14th i ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell. i'm self taught and i worked hard to improve the system. but i found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. impossible.too many issues. and it's like a scam. he deliver to the clients and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore... i still work to found out a system that i created and able to work in the uae. i purposed it to my boss. but he doesn't wanna change anything. during this time i notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. finally on july 14th i decided to stop. our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during august from france. finally today, he kept my miners 5 k usd , he never paid my salary and i had to explain my daughters that i can't see them this summer. i lost everything. i can't pay my bills, i can't pay my food, i can't pay my insurance and now i'm sick... i'm so stupid to believe people. i've been to police but as he is local and i have no official contract there's nothing they can do. i've been to his competitor company to tell them that i can do this system for them. they was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. but later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. the boss try to know my system i created to keep it for him and later get rid of me. today, i'm in a very bad situation, i keep fighting, i guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. i'm starving and i have fever now... after one year... i really still.love dubai. but as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode... i swear that sometimes i just wanna give up on everything but if i'm still here it's because of my daughters.",0
i feel like i'll never be happy at any job. even my dream job. i say this because that's where i am now. my dream job. i've wanted to be a plumber for so many years. and now to be here for a month. to realize i'm not smart enough to do a job this complicated. i'm not tough enough to be around people like the ones here. i'm too different for anyone in this line of work to want anything to do with me. i'm a trans woman. and i'm not out here. but they've already assumed that i am even tho i absolutely don't pass or look female at all at work. i've gone a bit off track but my point is this. i've worked so hard. worked through so many shitty jobs literally to get to this one job. my goal. my dream. and now i'm here. and i hate it more than anything. i hate that i have barely improved since i got here no matter how hard i try. it just makes me want to end everything. because if i got my dream job what else is there? nothing that i feel i'd want. it feels like no matter where i go i'll just be unhappy and hate my life. i spend all day thinking about how much i wish i could unalive myself. but i know i'm too scared of death to do it. transitioning has kinda been one of the hardest things i've ever done in my life. and doing that while also trying to be the best possible employee i can be. it's all just too much for me. at my last job i could manage. i was actually good at it. but i fucked myself out of that one because i left without notice. so now my only hope is that my old boss is desperate enough for people that he'll take me back. and even then. the one person who knows my secret probably told everybody so idek if it's safe to be there anymore. i feel so trapped. like. either magically get better at this job and somehow magically become less depressed. or have no job and kill myself. i know if it gets to that point that's what i'm doing. i don't wanna be unemployed again. and if i lose this job. i just. i csnt do it anymore after that. i just wish i could be normal like everyone else. and handle things like everybody else does. i wish i could be somewhere and be myself. but that'll never happen. i wish i could be smarter. but i can't. i damaged my brain so much with drugs that even after 2 years sober i can't remember shit unless it's repeated a million and a half times. i dont know what to do anymore. i feel so lost.,0

"i changed my mind.. not too long ago, i had a date for myself. august 13. that was the day i would end my own life using researched methods to make sure my death was as painless and quick as possible. it was the day that i would have died alone in my house before my family returned from vacation with no one else but my dog obliviously resting by my cadaver. a part of me still wanted to live. it's the part of me that wrote that post in this subreddit, and it's the part of me that convinced me to reach out to a friend to liberate my feelings for once. i cried. i said the reasons i had come up with to live just weren't enough for me anymore. not hobbies. not family. not natural beauty. it just felt like everything was a lie or an illusion. during that call, i was able to come up with a reason to stay alive. i could not deny the fact that suicide is a horrible thing. yes, in some circumstances it's necessary, but in most it's not. my family had already suffered a suicide. it was my aunt's husband. he hung himself in a drunken stupor. maybe the alcohol made his weak spot show and whatever haunted him took advantage. i don't know. i never knew him. he died well before i was born. regardless, i knew that if i committed suicide, the trauma would reopen several wounds in my family. my aunt and her side of the family would grieve again but more viscerally this time. my mom suffers from clinical depression like me, so my suicide would destroy her. other relatives may lash out at my parents and point fingers to cope with the pain, causing irreparable rifts to balkanize my entire family. i don't want to bring anymore pain into this world. there's more than enough. i think my medication was able to help me have some sense of reason during this time. i suffer from seasonal depression ironically during the summer. the past summer was one of my worst depressive episodes ever. i did consider suicide, but i didn't even have the energy to actualize it, as grim as it may sound i was fortunate for that. still, i was bitter at the world. i was bitter that people i'd try to be friends with would reveal something bad about themselves that would make me want to distance myself from them. i was bitter that i'd be singled out for ridicule, condescension, bullying, and other mistreatment behind the scenes, so that everyone else got to enjoy the beautiful persona of someone who had hurt me. i was bitter that my efforts to overcome my depression seemed to always result in going back to square one after a very short period of time. after talking with my friend, i was at least able to let that bitterness give me some more reasons why i shouldn't end my own life. 1. this world is full of pendejadas bullshit. i prefer the word in spanish because it's more colorful to me , but i'm not gonna let it be my reason to end my life. why? i don't think this world is worth ending my life over because it's a crock of horseshit, and i'm not going to let horseshit get me to do something i shouldn't do. 2. i have come to accept that since the world is full of pendejadas , i might as well let it become my norm. if i'm numb to it, it can't hurt me or haunt me. emotional pain would become a slap on the wrist. i can manage my expectations. i can lower my standards to a reasonable extent. it'll help me appreciate the little good things that come by. 3. in a world full of pendejadas , there are also people full of pendejadas . so i shouldn't take anything personally. not my boss, not my roommates, not my bullies, not my family, not my fake friends, no one. if i'm going to give a shit, no one is going to get it but me. i'm here to care about my own shit, my own well being. what anyone else does means nothing. i'm just trying to be comfortable. 4. a promise to myself: the more this world tries to be cruel to me, the more i will take care of myself. it's the best revenge after all: good health. if i can't have happiness easily, i could at least make sure i eat enough food, drink enough water, maintain good hygiene, clean my room, distract myself with media, pursue hobbies, etc. this world is apathetic to me, so i shall be apathetic about its apathy. 5. it's very easy for me to be obsessed with something outside of myself as a distraction. some stupid event. some mundane person. some worthless thing. some useless activity. when really, i should just be obsessed with myself. what do i want to do with my life? what do i want to do for fun? what do i want to have for lunch? it's about my decisions. my self care. 6. in order to fulfill this ultimate self care, i must reduce the pendejadas in my life. i plan on doing so in the following ways: 1. keeping my social circle small and being extremely picky about who i let in and who i keep around. i will label people. i'm not going to form attachments easily. i will expect the worst out of any person. 2. i think most humans aren't worth a relationship of any kind. so i'm not going to concern myself with finding a romantic partner i'm aromantic any way , having children, or making new friends. i'm not closing myself off, i'm just not on the look out anymore. forming new relationships will no longer be something i try to do unless it's for my survival, like for work . 3. i accept that things will never be the way i want them to be. 9 of the sex i have with men is mediocre. many friendships i have fail because i end up overlooking how they mistreat me or they just end up mistreating me inevitably. this world will never accept me or accommodate for who i am based on my salient identities such as race, gender, and ability, at least not in my lifetime. i'm tired of my dramatic suffering. i'm tired of shitty humans. i'm tired of the world employing its innovative torture methods on me. i didn't ask to be here, i didn't agree to anything, and i just want to go to sleep. amp; x2 b; tldr: i used to want to kill myself. i changed my mind after talking to a friend because it made me realize that this world is bullshit, most people are bullshit, most things are bullshit. and i'm not letting bullshit influence my actions.

"why is nothing helping. i don t understand it, i really am doing what other people tell me to do so i can feel better but nothing works and the looming thought of death gets more appealing as time goes by and that s all i want anymore because not even my distraction methods work anymore and i don t get why i should stick around",0
"what would you say?. i've always wondered. not that anyone cares about me enough to say these things to me. but i've always wondered, what would you say to me if you knew it would be my last day being alive? what would you say if you knew i'm going to commit suicide?",0
"i am done.. i will try praying again, if that doesn't work, i'm jumping off a 1 story building tomorrow, i'm at my limit, no one would care about my existance anyway, i'll be forgotten i am tired of crying and being addicted to multiple things. i will numb myself and just jump or maybe use the rope",0
"i'm so tired of bottling my feelings up. i was trying to get into a bilingual class in a school but i missed the date. they said that there is a second date in august but only if i assembled the right documents in may. i got into this school but not into the bilingual class. while signing the papers i saw that the list of the bilingual class was full. once again i ask if there is a chance. they say ''nope, sorry'' so i lost all fucking hope august came and yesterday i checked the list of free spots left in schools because i was simply curious. guess fucking what there was one free spot left in the bilingual class. i called the school it was 2 pm and ask them if this is legit because like????? they said yes and that i actually didn't have to assemble the documents in may. these shitheads told me several times there is no chance for me and when i lose all hope it's suddenly there? what the actual fuck the secretary was working until 3 pm. i would have to sign the papers again and it takes like 3 minutes i had to drive to the school first. she said that she must abide by the rules so she won't stay for me, and also mentioned there are like 6 people that too want to get into the bilingual class even if there's only one spot left my mother told me its all my fault that i didn't look after the date, but what is the point in doing that when every single time i was told i won't get into the bilingual class? she said that i'm dumb and she cannot believe that i give up so easily my sibling said to me that it's also my fault that i didn't try. i rarely give up but how could i not in this situation? i just nodded at everything they said i don't want to even bother anymore im so tired of bottling my feelings up i feel hopeless and tired every single day and i feel like i can't tell anyone because they will just say that i'm lying i just want someone to tell me it's going to be okay instead of constant criticising and expecting more and more from me i understand if for some this is not that big of a deal but i just can't take this shit no more this is probably a clusterfuck to read im sorry but iam cryingwhile writing this",0
"i feel like ending it all. the pressure of life is too much. i have made many mistakes and now the consequences are coming to haunt me. i live in a shadow of my former self. those around me don't know what is going on, i keep to myself all the time. i will be bankrupt soon, and i will lose what little of life i enjoy, and wreck anything good i tried to make. i am the consequence of so many bad decisions. i can't blame anyone for my sorrow, just me. i wasn't brave enough to face harsh circumstances, nor brave enough to tell people no. i want to end this sorry excuse for a successful life. i don't know how to end it, but if could procure a gun, it would be much easier. i want to end the anxiety, the depression, the pressure of everyday and just cut it out forever. i tried to do the impossible, lied to everyone i know because i didn't have the balls to say ""i failed"". death seems to be the only way out.",0

am i having a mental breakdown?. yes u are,0
i hear voices from the virgin mary saying i have no value because i have no good in me. if the highest spiritual authority says this then why should i be alive?. it makes me suicidal in ways you can't imagine. i know it's real that mary has discarded me because i can hear her telepathically daily and i feel her presence. i really just want to end it knowing that the highest heavenly authority has no love and no interest for me. i've spent years hating the world to my spiritual detriment and i was so persistent in the hate that it basically got to a point where spiritual authorities gave up and have forsaken me. heaven and the spirit world don't love me so why should i live on this planet if i'm rejected by the highest spiritual authorities?,0

"should i tell them or just go away?. i want to disappear from this world. first i want to seclude myself so no one can interrupt me or catch on. i've been talking to a few dudes who messaged me thru my posts see my first post for full . its time for me to isolate myself for a while until i'm further along, but i kinda feel bad. so my question is, would you just want to be ghosted by the apparently? attractive easy chick you have been chatting with for a while after friendly chat? or would you rather hear she is leaving and she is saying goodbye to go die alone? i think that's wayy too deep for anyone to hear.. somewhere in between? just lie to them about it? this sucks.. i'm not completely heartless.. yet. one day it'll blow out my chest. i'd maybe come back again to post there after a while.. i need to get out now so no one can see obvious signs starting to form anyways. it'll look sus if i send too many too often, everyone will see how fast i'm disappearing.... if i make it until a next time to post i wonder how many more people would want me? this world truly isn't about health or good. people love me so much better sick. i'll give them what they want to my grave. i'm just here for a good time and some encouragement to my doom. i figure why not share my body with people? they will take my organs when i die if they still are worth a damn. why not let them use it now; especially if it helps the cause? these men are kinda silly. they don't believe i'm real, they can't believe i don't want money or anything in return.. you already are giving me what i want silly boy; telling me my hard work is showing now. lol. won't it be funny if the girl that was sending you nudes just ghosted you after reading this? don't think about it.

"i think im failing bca because of a very stupid mistake i dont want to deal with my stupid existence any more.. so i answered my 1st year backlog today i'm in 2nd year and have cleared all exams in 2nd year so that i can pass to 3rd year. it is a relatively simple subject but i fcked up because i didn't have 3 chapters of it i didn't even know we had it. i feel so stupid i should've confirmed months ago about the syllabus but i didn't i thought i had all ppts. and now for this stupid mistake i will probably have to pay for by repeating 2nd year as this was last chance . i don't want to repeat a year i never failed before and the amount of scorn and disappointment i will get from everyone will probably get beyond my tolerance i don't know why i'm so fucking stupid. i didn't do well even with the syllabus i had learnt. i have no hopes about my internals i don't want to go to college again where my peers, even those who aren't studious have passed and i'm stuck behind like a loser. i have been just dragging myself to study from years even though i didn't want to. in my country degree is very important i can't quit either. i don't know what else to join if i change course i'll b wasting 2 years instead of 1. my parents already think i'm a loser and now it will get much worse as this course is much easier compared to most courses. i don't want to fail. i'll probably end myself if i did, idk. i had thought of it a lot these past couple of years but maybe now it will b breaking point.",0

"i think im not gona meke it till tomorrow. little backstory . since i was little i have dealt with some several mental problems self harm, eating problems, anxiety and severe depression, among others most of them have been medicated for a long time. my parents pressure me that if i get 9.6 it's not good because someone got 9.9. if was gaining weight , if i don't do an activity my cousin does, if i do a lot of things and that they don't have my time,if i eat or didn't eat. my friends, although without knowing it, make comments about ""i eat and i don't get fat"" or ""no op is super judgmental "" for saying that she has beautiful eyes ""op this or that"" my family compares me with my cousins and demands that if i'm good at something and my cousins isn't it's because i'm selfish and i don't help them enough. .there were times when i felt fine and suddenly something triggers my depression or eating problems and sometimes relapse in my self harm. recently during the pandemic i tried to overdose myself, it didn't work i woke up on my bathroom floor after several hours with a horrible headache very low oxygenation and heart rate i don't know how i survived. shortly after, a trip to the er for my heart rate i was almost hospitalized for my eating problems, i won't go into too much detail as it still triggers me. this was in a pandemic, i had a relapse and then i started university face to face, i tried to occupy myself as much as possible, which only made me about to die due to my losing weight, i had my second attempt after having a panic attack in the middle of the parking lot while i was buying party decorations with my father and i decided to stay in the car since i was still shaking and my dad thought it was a tantrum for not wanting to get out and he proceeded to tell me how selfish, embarrassing, ungrateful daughter i am . recently less than a week i had my third suicide attempt that i almost succeeded in if it weren't for some friends i didn't go into much detail with them i said it was accidental and they believed me. i just can't take it anymore i feel that maybe it would be easier for everyone and for me if i died, my parents wouldn't spend money on me, my friends wouldn't have to put up with me, a few free hours for my psychologist that someone who needs them could use. it would be good for everyone if i wasn't here anymore . and yes for me it would be like turning off a tv suddenly dark that's what i like to believe i feel like it's easier just to take a knife and cut my wrists and if this thought doesn't go away i will not mane it till tomorrow",0

"i don t want to die but i don t want to live.. throw away account because i have family on reddit. basically i m miserable. a part of me feels guilty for even considering writing something like this. for some context, i m an 18 year old female, people would say i have an amazing life. i ve got a big family and parents that love me so much, my upbringing was great, i m a spoilt child, have the best support system from my family too. however i have an ed and suffer everyday of my life with chronic nausea, i was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ocd years ago and have tried both therapy and medication along with self soothing techniques. nothing has worked. i have had hundreds of tests done, bloods, stools, urine, fitness, gyno, i ve seen both a therapist and a nutritionist and i ve even done hypnotherapy. long story short, i get nausea every single day, it starts the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep if i can even sleep that night . accompanying this nausea i have extreme stomach twitching, it s not painful but it s extremely uncomfortable, it makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, so bad i wish to rip my stomach out. no body knows what s causing these symptoms and they have just been pinned to anxiety which is fair enough if only i could cure my anxiety. every day of my life i m miserable, i lost interest in all that i used to love like my cat, reading and gaming, i don t go out because i m just constantly uncomfortable and nauseated, i m barely strong enough now to even walk anyways, i have no friends anymore, all i can do is sit about and stare into space. i m so numb to everything that i can t even cry anymore, in fact i feel like i can t show any emotion anymore. i don t laugh, i don t cry, i don t show anger or sympathy, i can t even force a smile. i ve never had an appetite and i don t eat a lot of food because it makes me easily uncomfortable or irritates my body, this lead to a ed diagnosis at a younger age. i m severely underweight and lacking basic minerals to stay healthy, i survive on protein shakes and biscuits for the most part. i had seen an ed therapist for a while but nothing changed. at this point i don t know what to do anymore, my parents are clearly exhausted and so am i, i don t find the point in living anymore and literally the only think that is stopping me from suicide at this point is knowing i d bring my parents and little siblings so much pain, even tho part of me feels like being gone would relieve the load from my parents shoulders. i see my siblings living their lives every day so carefree and happily, never having to worry about throwing up or giving out and it makes me that little bit more miserable. i know it s not their fault and i don t wish for them to be miserable like me at all btw, i suppose i m just jealous of them. i don t know where i m going with this or why i wrote it but i just wanted to get it off my chest because i can t share it with anymore else. i don t want to tell my parents i m suicidal, even though i m pretty sure they re already aware. i m at a loss because what is there to do at this point, i ve tried everything, i ve reached out for help, i ve been on meds, i even started self harming this last year just to convince myself i can still feel something. i feel horrible and am constantly reminded how good i have it, how i shouldn t be doing or feeling this but i can t help it anymore. i don t want to die, but i don t want to live either.",0
"this is what dubai is for me..... this is what dubai is for me... last year i decided to left france and start a new life in dubai. after 22 years of careers through military, firefighter, paramedic, policeman, teacher, consultant... i decided to left this crazy, country of racists, homophobic, close minded and aggressive to restart a new life. in fact, i've been harassed by the director of the fire department who never accepted that i married a transgender from philippines. i'm divorced now by the way. after i sold my house and resigned my career i traveled 13 countries in europe, south america and middle east. until i found dubai. during this time i use all my money in trading and forex and i was almost millionaire. homeless but comfortable situation. later i.lost everything because of new waves of covid. doesn't matter i still have a good health, my arms and i'm a genius i mean high iq . so i decide to restart here. i bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3 a month. time for me to settle down a new life here. my miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. everything was fine until may. on may 14th i ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell. i'm self taught and i worked hard to improve the system. but i found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. impossible.too many issues. and it's like a scam. he deliver to the clients and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore... i still work to found out a system that i created and able to work in the uae. i purposed it to my boss. but he doesn't wanna change anything. during this time i notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. finally on july 14th i decided to stop. our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during august from france. finally today, he kept my miners 5 k usd , he never paid my salary and i had to explain my daughters that i can't see them this summer. i lost everything. i can't pay my bills, i can't pay my food, i can't pay my insurance and now i'm sick... i'm so stupid to believe people. i've been to police but as he is local and i have no official contract there's nothing they can do. i've been to his competitor company to tell them that i can do this system for them. they was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. but later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. the boss try to know my system i created to keep it for him and later get rid of me. today, i'm in a very bad situation, i keep fighting, i guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. i'm starving and i have fever now... after one year... i really still.love dubai. but as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode... i swear that sometimes i just wanna give up on everything but if i'm still here it's because of my daughters.",0
thoughts gettin worse. so back story grew up oldest of three brothers with and drunk abusive father that abused us until i was least 15 idk my parents split up we also constantly moved. my mother is bi polar and schizophrenic. we had to go through livin with a parent that goes through that and get blamed every time she went to hospital. when they split i went with her alone so someone would take care of her. she still struggles with it to this day. around 2 to 21 i got with a girl that was pregnant by another man she was a family friend so we ended up falling in love when i went over there to protect and watch over. we broke up right before the child was born but got right back together and we re on and off for 8 years the whole time her telling the kid i m his real father. even tho her father constantly told people at his parities and when trick or treatin i m not really us dad. long story short the youngest brother kills himself in 2 19. me and the girlfriend last a year after and than break up but she won t let me talk or see the kid anymore. my middle age brother goes through a divorce at same time and loses some rights to his daughter but can still see some and least talk to her. we both have now been on heroin for last two years. i have finally been trying to convince him for us to both quit for good for his daughter and grandma. also cause feel like we lost youngest brother to coke. he started getting really depressed off it and night killer himself he was on it. so i feel it even more wrong for me and other brother to do drugs cause they took out youngest from us. the biggest problem we live with grandma that is like our mom and she enables us tremendously. giving us money every day and letting us use the cars. even when we have told her not to trust us etc. hopefully this time she sticks by not enabling idk tho cause she said she give no one anything anymore but she still gave me money. fortunately i actually want us to quit especially my brother cause he has the most to lose. everytime we try to he breaks i even went to the hospital and put myself on a l2k just to quit but came back to him and his friend that lives with us using. so i started again. anyway sorry for long sob story just hope people can wish us luck on getting clean because i m beyond codependent on my brother i can t lose another and be left alone. i hate us hurting our grandma tho cause she done nothing but be there for us our whole life. that s why i feel like i m give up on life if we don t make it this time. thanks to those who read this.,0
"i don t know i guess i just have to talk.. i feel like i don t have a purpose anymore, i got out of the marines and met an amazing girl. that was 6 months ago in 2 days. i m a baker now and she s gone and i keep trying to fill the void of her being gone and the feeling i m not doing anything anymore. i hated and loved being in the marines even after my divorce which i almost ended my life over last year because at the same time i was told i had contracted hiv but today and yesterday and all week i ve just been looking at my gun under my pillow and i want to just drive into the mountains here in colorado and end it all. i m in debt and it s crushing me and i hate this dead end job but i don t think i can make it to my 23rd birthday in less than a month. i don t know what to do. im just tired, but maybe talking about it will help.",0

"love, plans and lies. ever since i was rejected by one of my close friends, ive never been the same. it took me 3 years to work up the courage to ask her out, the weird part is that i knew she was going to reject me and yet i still shattered horribly. after that i planned out when i wanted to kms, the specific date is the day after my bday cuz i told myself ""i dont want to live past 2 "". ive told my other close friends abt this date ive set and they told me to not go, to keep on going and that theyll be by my side... so i told them ""a few more years couldnt hurt"" which was a big lie. nothing can stop this and the date is fast approaching",0
help. im so lonely and so sad and just numb at the same time i know i have something wrong with at this point i also don t want to be a burden to anyone i m scared to ask for help i try to give hints but no one notices maybe cause i m always pretending to be happy. or maybe i m not worth the effort i m just tired people always say it gets better that s bs it only gets worse i have no one in the world who cares for me right now and it s hard i m tired of waiting for someone or something to help me i just want to feel loved but i don t feel like i deserve that i m worthless i don t wanna die but at this point i don t see another option idk how long i can hold on for it s just too hard. i ve been so close to just quitting these past few days idk what s wrong with me,0

sorry to bother anyone have no one to talk to.. i'm struggling with extreme paranoia i think everyone wants to hurt me i haven't left my house in a month of so. i don't trust anyone. i can never have a relationship with anyone. i haven't spoken a word in days i have no one to talk to. any even if i did they just want to hurt me anyway to what's the point. my life is over. i want to die. just to much of a coward to go through with it. maybe one day i will build up the courage to go through with it.,0
i felt better today.. i can t believe it and i don t know what happened but i woke up feeling good despite sleeping for only 2 hours and had plans for the day. maybe my prayers worked i don t know but it s a long time since i hadn t thought of suicide.,0
"my existence is pointless. all i can ever think about is why we are here, why i am here, and if humanity is collectively on the right path. is the construct of society conducive to our existence and perhaps growth and beings? or out we distracting and blinding ourselves from the greater purpose? the human race revolves and runs on a piece of paper with arbitrary numbers to which have caused greed and the need for power. while balance is key and you cannot have peace without destruction, the scales have been tipped off balance. i will be ending in all in with the comfort in knowing that i will no longer be contributing to the lost cause of the human race. either humanity ceases to exist or i cease to exist. i cannot live in the world any longer. we have lost touch with our true purpose, that is a world i can no longer live in.",0
im stuck. i post here a lot because i dont get help because i feel like im more comfortable in the sadness than when im happy and i feel i deserve this burning hatred of life i dont think i shouldve survived past 8th grade sometimes i wish i had learned to cut deeper sooner i take pills every night and every time i wake up the next day. i just wont die. i take handfuls of pills and nothing so im stuck being alive and im stuck where i am in life i cant escape any of this and i feel like im at the bottom of the ocean. completely alone and suffocated by the weight of it all.,0
"i don't feel like i'm meant to be here. hello, i'm traumadumping here because i feel like i'm about to go off the rails. i'm sorry. anyways. everything feels so unnatural. unreal. when i was a kid my mom would often express her fear of me being a ""failure to thrive"" and i worry she's right. i've been attempting suicide since i was 9 but obviously never succeeded, sometimes i'm fine others i can barely get a grip. i'm 2 almost 21 now and i have no concept of time. months now are passing like weeks used to. every day feels like a fight. i don't even remember huge chunks of my waking hours. apparently i have full blown conversations with my partner that i don't remember the next day. like make plans and shit, then i have no memory the next day. i feel so crazy and i just really want it to end. i can't end it though because my partner relies on me and if i die he would be sol and i'd essentially ruin any chance he has at life he's 19 though a big thing that's been happening is really bad. usually my intrusive thoughts and psychosis are about hurting me, but lately they have been about hurting other people. and it's strong . i just ignore the thoughts but they have been too much. like i'm tied to a chair and my eyelids are taped open while someone shows me gorey, horrific visions of hurting innocent people who just annoy me. i can't do anything about it either. therapy is too expensive and i can't take any time off work for my mental health either. i feel like suicide is the only option even though i know it's not a real option at all. i just don't know what to do. i want to die but i have to live to take care of others. i can't ruin other people's lives just because i can't live my own. blah, i don't know",0
i have bipolar and i want to die. the title sums it up pretty well. i ve tried killing myself in the past and i always wish i was successful. i ve been able to keep suicide on hold because knew it was an option i could exercise at a later point. but since i ve started taking my medication my life s been falling apart gradually. i ve gained 2 kgs 45 pounds in 2 months. my ability to lift weights has gone out of the window. i ve lost a lot of my hair. i feel groggy and i m unable to work or study. seeing other people happy or fit makes me look down upon myself. i ll have to be on medication the rest of my life and i don t have the energy to give things a try. i ve been on different meds in the past and i had similar problems with them. i ve had enough and i don t want to go on any longer. i m only 2 and i hate that i have to face this but it s a genetic disease and there s not much i can do about it.,0

killing myself in 29 days. give me one good reason why i shouldn't,0
"i don't want to die, i want to kill myself. you know what i mean? hi, sorry, just another scream in the void because where else should screams go? i don't know, this is the weirdest suicidal ideation i've ever had in my life. i'll give you some context, i suppose. i've got my fair share of trauma. i've collected all the abuse types, so to speak. diagnosed with bpd when i was 19, never had the ability to hold on to a job or a relationship. whenever i found someone to give me affection my entire world would revolve around them; i'd obsess over them and if i felt like they didn't love me i would feel every nerve in my body set ablaze. it was a pain that was blinding and suffocating and it felt like the only way to end it was to extinguish my very existence. i've had kidney stones that felt like ecstasy compared to that raw, burning pain of feeling unloved. every time i've ever wanted to die, it was a very, very active thought that i must die, immediately. but... i got better for a while. i actually joked that i was the first person to be cured of bpd. i had untreated grave's disease, my thyroid was frying my brain with a daily overdose of thyroid hormones. i never got treatment because every time a doctor tried to treat me they would sternly tell me, ""if you continue to leave this untreated, you will die."" man, i wanted to die. i hated myself. i hated my life. i always thought, ""good, if it kills me that's one less thing on my to do list "" so i let my brain fry like that for years. i finally accepted treatment one day because the person i was in a relationship with at the time begged me, and it was the first time i actually felt that i had a person who loved me as much as i loved them very rare for a bpd, lemme tell ya . so i did it. i got it fixed. and holy shit. holy shit. bliss. it was a slow change. not immediate. as my physical symptoms went away and my body was healing, my headspace started to shift too. at the age of 25 i was finally born. for the first time in my life i was able to keep a job. i was fucking awesome at my job, too. i started feeling capable. i started feeling confident. i stopped hating myself. i started... liking myself. i started loving myself. i would think of all my past suicide attempts and have these horrible panic attacks thinking that i almost missed out on all of this joy. i almost prevented myself from experiencing this wonderful life. it hurt my heart to think of my past self suffering. she deserved better. but i was happy to finally be able to give myself better. i sent myself telepathic love letters to the past; i'd think as hard as i could to please hold on because holding on will get us to here, and i love you so much, past me, so please keep being strong. i still had rough days but they were just days. i was happy. then the world ended. thanks 2 2 . i tried staying strong for so long. i lost my job, but i tried to be optimistic about it because i'd been feeling like i wanted something better. i lost some friends. i lost my partner. i got my first apartment and was and still am single. i had always been in relationships since i started dating; i was codependent as hell and i couldn't take being alone. but i learned to love being single. it's a lot easier to be alone when you don't despise yourself. i found a lovely group of friends, i talked to them every day. i had a lot of money saved up to pay my rent without working for a while. i was down. but it was just a low point. it was nothing like that searing, burning pain i used to feel. not even comparable. but it keeps... getting lower. i still don't have an income and it like i can't figure out how to get myself to work now. i have started attaching my worth to my crush again. my bank account is overdrafted the entirety of my rent payment this month. i'm out of money. i keep getting into these moods where i feel like my sweet friends don't care about me. they hurt my feelings sometimes and i know i feel too much. i know i'm too sensitive. but they hurt me and then act like it's my fault i'm hurt and i feel like the best thing i can do is just... disappear. and that's what i want. i want to disappear. i want to get in my car. and drive. and i want to feel the tires gently start to lift off the road, getting higher and higher, miles and miles above the earth, until finally i plummet into a black hole. it doesn't hurt like acid, it hurts like novocaine. there's no feeling at all but you know the drill is going too deep. and i just want it to stop. i want to stop worrying about money. i want to stop worrying about being too sensitive. i want to be held. i want to feel loved. i want to vanish. i want to be seen. i want to be heard. i want to be cherished. i want to be enough. i want someone to care. i want the novocaine to wear off. i want to feel. sometimes i imagine how it would feel to drive very fast, and stop even faster, crashing my car into a tree. and when i imagine it, it feels like nothing at all. i know, i know it would hurt so bad if i really did it. it would hurt a lot and i may feel pain forever. but i would feel. god, i would feel. anyways i'm not really sure what to do about all that. i won't hurt myself because i can't. i care about myself too much. i know i don't want to be dead, i just don't want the life i currently have. but i feel like i will never have the one i want. it feels so out of reach. and i feel like my brokenness is so trivial compared to where i was years ago. past me felt real pain. past me would laugh if she heard someone like me talk about being suicidal because she'd see right through it. she'd say, ""you're not really even suicidal. you don't even know pain. you're choosing to be weak. you're choosing this."" and she'd be right. i am. but i don't know how to stop. i really don't. thanks for reading.",0

"feeling like it s the end of the world because i got a traffic ticket. hi. i m new here. so, last week i received a traffic ticket for a railroad violation. i went through the railroad crossing just as the arm starting going down and the lights started flashing. i know know that is very dangerous. no one was hurt, nothing was damaged. i was obviously pulled over on a main road two lanes going both directions . and the police officer didn t get out of the car for a few minutes and i wasn t sure if he wanted me to pull into a parking lot. so i started to inch forward and the office obviously followed me which i stopped right away and then the officer came out to talk to me. i only got one ticket and it was just for the railroad crossing, but i feel like a complete idiot and hate myself for doing this. i talked with a lawyer who will go to court on my behalf. but i truly feel like my life is over and i feel scared constantly. i have always had anxiety but i feel like the worst person ever and i m so ashamed of this. i m so scared i m beyond help.",0
"all i can think about is dying. i ve never been very good at talking to people. i ve never been the worst, but i just avoid talking to people as best as i can because it makes me really nervous and anxious and i can t overcome my thoughts in those moments. it s because of this, and me constantly pushing people away, that i don t have anyone in my life that i can talk to. i just feel lost and i don t know what to do. i ve been thinking about how suicide is my only escape and i hate that thought. i don t want to die, but it s also something i ve never wanted more. i just wish that i had never existed in the first place. my 21st birthday is in less than 2 weeks and i ve always imagined that i would have at least a small group of friends to go do something with but i m going to have no one just like the last few years. it s my fault so i can t complain, but i wish i knew how to overcome this and how to get people to care about me and like me. this is the first time i ve had persistent suicidal thoughts since right before high school and it s just depressing. i know it s not really me thinking this shit, but it also is. i don t know what to do. i feel so alone and unwanted in this world",0

i wish i was smarter. everyone is just so intelligent. they re so talented and can articulate themselves with their words and actions so well. i can never understand anything beyond the surface level. everyone else has such a deep complex understanding of their interests and the world. i m just completely hollow. i am nothing. i m a completely worthless autistic waste of life. i need to stop being delusional and admit to myself that it will never get better.,0
i can finally end it. well after everything that happened today my mental state is clearly fragile and i know i won't be able to do this until i get my degree. so i found a way tomorrow i have to drive a long distance. i hope that another car will crash into us but only kill me and no one else. if that doesn't happen i'm going to the beach so i figured i'll just drown. before i was worried about traumatizing my roommate with my body but if i purposefully drown everyone will think it was an accident it's a win win. i'm sad this is how it has to happen but i'll be glad to finally end all this needless pain and suffering.,0
i just want attention. that's it really. i'm a pathological liar and i lie about stuff so i can try to seem more interesting. i just want somebody to notice me. my boyfriend has been mad at me about my lying habit understandably and tn he said goodnight but i can see he's active. he says he still loves me and is willing to stay with me but i'm all but sure that he doesn't want me. i've created this hell in which i live in. i did this. i wanna off myself just to say sorry ig. there's no other way i feel like i can apologize. more than anything i just wanna be noticed.,0
how do i hide it from my friends. i m struggling a lot right now and a frequent self harmer. before i would do it on my arms and legs it places where it s not impossible where it would get a scratch where i cut but people have been noticing those so i ve moved on to places that i can more easily hid like my stomach. me and my three friends are very very close. i ve decided to give them one more good summer to remember me by. we often see each other in various states of undress like when we shop or swim together. i ve lately been turning around while i change to hide but i think they re suspecting something. and if i refuse to change in front of them at all they definitely will know somethings up. how do i deflect their suspicions about my state of mind and better hide?,0

"i'm sorry. i've got no right for sympathy or space to be heard. i'm sorry for posting it. could have written just for myself, but i feel that the symbolic value of telling about it to others can make me feel being heard. i'll soon delete it. it's all my fault. my loneliness, self hstred, increasing anxiety and slow abandonment of any human lifestyle. i wasn't working or solving problems only in transport between jobs and now, when came home. i'm tired but i'm not. i envy people that were told they are loved. i envy kind and generous people. i envy confident ones. i envy people with strong resilience. i can envy people that don't try to run away from their families. i envy attention. the older i get the less i believe myself when i dream i can run away and pretend to be normal. that i can become better, that i can have moments of happiness. i caught myself thinking that there's nothing left in my life that makes it worth it. then i rembered how happy i feel when i put my alarm ten minutes later early cool morning and stay under warm blanket. that's the only thing that gives me strength. i'll never make anyone happy. i can't afford to have kids. i don't love anything and anyone, including myself. i no longer believe that i can get love by being polite, studying gard, doing my low wage part time jobs responsibly or making good films. you'll never make good films because you've started doing them to get love you want. that's why you had no progress throughout film school. you literally liked only one film of yours because you liked the person you worked on it with. you're literally the worst. asshole. i have a dream. i don't want to kill myself just like so many people that fight these urges i just want it all to end. i want to lose my memory: my visual, muscle and reflex memory. it's ok, i don't have that many skills. i want to forget parents, him and her, i want to forget shame and a habit to beat myself up. it's all my fault. it's a very adult self hatred, i'm proud of maturing. i was trying to control myself and not let bad thoughts out. i'm keeping silent about suicide thoughts, self hstred and real unwillingness to shoot our next film. i improved, i'm trying to keep myself together. i have no energy to improved but i try really hard to keep yogether. and still whenever i slip i'm the biggest asshole in the world. ""how could you tell me you were fighting suicide thoughts. like why would you put it on me? i'm not an audience for that."" thanks. now i feel even more guilty. i'm so tired. i want it all to end. i want to stop fighting desire to smash my head against the wall and punch myseld in the stomach with all my force. i want to stop fighting urge to scream to you how angry i am, how lonely it has been for me. i've cried so much tonight. but i'm doing a good thing, i'm trying to put it all out, i'm trying to understand what's going on. i haven't even reached out to anyone, that's veryvresponsible. there is a chance for me. if i have enough energy i can invest concentration and energy into thinking better, into making my thoughts go in a right direction. i will be able to overcome my ego and fear. i will be able to concentrate on perfecting my storytelling skills. i will not kill myself. i will not be a miserable lonely loser. it will take time, but i'll get there. i'll be calm, i'll be likeable, i'll have something to tell.sbout myself at the parties. i've got a suspicion what a trigger might have been. fuck you, stupid man. you're the worst, you've got no taste, you handle bad moods even worse than i do and you're dumb as a newborn pigeon. never want to hear about you again. there's a reason i cut people i loved from my life and convince myself they never really existed. i want a healthy clear brain. i want a strong ego that doesn't need anyone else. i want a stone heart. i want resilience of a grass lane. it got better now, which is good. i've stopped screaming and sobbing, i won't need to occupy suicide prevention line, i got it myself. i'm a writer. i should learn how to construct that lie of a healthy reality. i want to forget and stop aching. if i tell myself more often i might forget what the truth is. love and good night,",0

one week. it s been one week since i tried to kill myself. i almost wish i was successful. i never had thoughts of wanting to hurt myself. two months ago i started having health issues. i don t even know at this point if i m going to get better or not. the way i m living now isn t living. i have to stay inside 24 7 and can t go outside. i haven t seen friends or family in months. i ve lost all self confidence i ever had. over the past two months my life has drastically changed and i can t accept the way things are. im extremely depressed and nothing is keeping me going. i feel like a burden to take care of. im at my wits end and don t want to do this anymore. i m trying to hang on but i don t know how much longer i can.,0

"i want this to end . i don t know if i truly wanna kill my self or not but god im reaching my breaking point. im tired of always being scared; i have ocd and constantly worry about sickness, or hurting other, etc etc. just this week i was debating whether or not give up oil painting cause i had read about the toxicity of oil paints, i spiraled and threw out all my solvents, and paints that were not of natural oil. you would think that would calm me down but no, i m still freaking out if smelling oil paint or any kind of paint will give me a chronic disease. i m so tired of being afraid of everything, i m tired of being depressed. or not being able to do dumb shit without being afraid of fucking getting cancer. i can t even enjoy something that s suppose to be relaxing. i went through a lot as a kid, my parents weren t the best. at least i don t think so i don t know what i experienced was love, i was pampered, they bought me anything and everything. i was spoiled. but behind close doors i was yelled at, pinched, hit with belts, manipulated, threatened, the list goes on. i was mostly my mother while my father was absent due to work; he doesn t even remember my birthday. i remember the moment where my mother truly hurt me; as hispanics giving the belt was a typical punishment. though when i was young i can t remember what i did, i could ve been in elementary. my mother had gotten her hands on a whip from my older sisters previous halloween costume, she folded it and whipped me on my fore arm leaving a lash mark. i remember crying, apologizing to her. she cries as well but never apologized. i was a kid. i think most of my issues started from then, i developed ocd. constantly worrying about anything and everything, i was was gonna grow up to be a murder, if i was gonna die tomorrow if i didn t wash my hands, etc. my childhood instead of being filled with happiness and rainbows was filled with fear and loneliness. i would come home to a house filled with fighting, my father drank, cheated, my mother was always in the kitchen and my sister ,bless her, tried her best to be a mother figure. but despite that i grew up thinking that the yelling and the pain was love. that i should be grateful, when other kids had nothing. and i had a computer, ipad, etc. to this day i m scared to admit that my parents hurt me. self harm, i didn t know what that word meant till middle school. i use to wonder why anyone would ever mutilate themselves, but slowly i started to find out why. i started to use rubber bands to slap my wrists, punch walls to bruise my knuckles, i just wanted to find any way to feel something. not long after i found a razor and started; after spending hours in the bathroom, i came out happy. as if i let out all that tightness; so i kept doing it. it made me forget. my wrists, stomach, forearms ,thighs covered; most of the cuts were shallow and didn t leave scaring. it s wasn t long till my mother found out, she cried. though i was given no comfort, on the country she just called my therapist to handle it. as my father was in the living room without a care in the world watching his soccer game, i was taken to the hospital, assisted, well i wasn t my distressed mother was. the doctors never took my word, and it was clear from the moment i got there. so i started to lie, they had already deemed my cuts to be shallow and not enough to be hospitalized and since i basically told them i was fine they just referred me to a psychiatrist and sent me on my way. did the psychiatrist help? no whatever i said in trust went through my mom, and she often twisted my words or just basically said things i did not say. since i couldn t escape the psychiatrist, therapy or medication i turned to cutting. i remember being so desperate to cut that i d rip eyebrow cutters or shaving razors to just get my hands on one. and i did, this time what was shallow cuts became gashes and they scarred. then i started to attempt my life, five separate times i attempted and no one knows. it was in middle school as well as my freshmen year of high school. i just remember crying and brushing my knuckles frustrated that i was such a pussy for not going through with it, i was in pain why couldn t i just make it stop. that leads to now i m going to college in the fall, an art school, majoring in illustration. stoped my medication, the pills never worked so why bother. i also didn t stop cutting, no one knows but what i found i became more sensitive. little things , little fears would be resolved in hurting myself. like my intrusive fears of oil painting, i love oil painting i want to keep doing it but i m afraid of cancer, and other chronic sickness so what do i do. i cut. god i m pathetic why am i writing a reddit post of my life, maybe because i just want someone to care to not look at me as if i m crazy to not insult me or manipulate me like i was all my life. to not think my ocd intrusive fears are stupid, i want to be treated like a person i want to live a normal life but i can t do that. i can t even make decisions for myself without being scared, i m a grown ass person and i m crying about the smallest things. sorry about this post being so long, i m basically telling my whole story maybe if i really do kill myself maybe someone would read this and saw what happens behind my upbeat personality. that i was hiding deep scars, that i cried every night wishing someone would come and tell me i m safe that i ll be ok. i m still scared of my parents, i feel like they build that in me already. i m scared of myself i m scared of art i m scared of people i m scared of the gashes on my skin that will never go away. i m scared of living i m scared of the future. i don t wanna die but i don t want to suffer. i can t handle this i m scared of everything i want it to stop i want to die i want it to end i wish i could say sorry to younger me. she didn t deserve e to have scars, to live a life of fear. to want to die. i was just a kid . i m sorry.",0

"backed myself into a corner. you know how everytime you threaten suicide and dont follow through people take you less and less seriously? i feel like ive been backed into a corner at this point. i haven't been unstable in a long while but lately im acting stupid. last night i sent out a major threat, wrote a note, texted my goodbyes apologizies, i even walked myself to my cities popular yeet spot. i just wanted someone to care to be honest, but as i stood there, thinking about doing it, nobody replied. admittedly i dont have many people in my life and it was 2am, they were both asleep and obviously wouldn't see it till they woke up. no one was there to talk me down or tell me i mattered. i got so upset it probably should have pushed me over the edge, but i wussed out in the end and just took myself home and cried myself to sleep. the good news is im alive i guess but the bad news neither one of those people cared. one is even my roommate. he undoubtedly saw the text this morning, probably checked up on me and saw that i didnt do anything and went about his day. neither one of them has texted me back any ounce of concern or even tried to call me. im so embarrassed i feel like i have no other choice but to follow through now. everybody thinks im full of shit, no one even cares anymore because they assume i wont do it. i just want to be less of a failure at something for once in my life.",0

"no amount of medication or therapy makes me want to stay. i ll admit i m more mentally stabilized than i ever have been, but i still yearn to just pass on. my soul is so exhausted of hurting, heartbreak, and loneliness. i ve tried to find my place in this world but the more i try, the more alienated i feel. it s not that i m not grateful for this world or what i have, it s living in this society that is slowly killing me. i wasn t built for this, at least not this lifetime. i ve been hanging on by threads for sometime now. if what i m doing right now falls through, i think this is going to be it for me. i ve started finalizing legal documents and getting them notarized etc. i m going to leave as little mess as i can. but this is really just all i can handle. i will be 27 in a month, and i think i ll be joining the 27 club. i thought i had 3 4 more years in me but i don t think i can hang on that long. i have no energy. i would need a miracle. but thinking about being able to just grab my gun at any moment and make it all end makes me feel comforted. it s right there next to me, usually at all times. all i have to do is wrap my hand around it and pull the trigger and the suffering and pain ends. sometimes when the thoughts are really heavy i can feel my hands almost vibrating, and burning, just wanting so badly to grip it. but i promised myself i wouldn t leave a mess like that. i just want this to stop. it s like a bad dream that i can t wake from. i don t know how to wake from this.. someone please wake me up or save me",0

"i very depressed mom. this weekend i tried to commit suicide twice, through the process i assaulted my husband punched his chest while sleeping for him to talk with me during the second incident. i was arrested, and ended up going to the hospital twice. i lost control infront of my daughter and involved both husband and daughter very briefly, but did none the less. my husband and i are forced to stay apart the next 17 days, i don't have alot of family and don't want to tell many people. i've been very sick mentally the pass 6 months, and alot has changed for us financially and for my health. my husband has been taking care of our two cats and dog myself and daughter and working fulltime. my husband wants a break from both my daughter and i, i'm not sure how to deal with this. the situation all began when i woke up from throwing up for 3 days, and my husband said he reached a breaking point said nothing else and walked away. i was abused by my parents as a child, and he contacted them to watch her for a few weeks so he could ketch up. unfortunately because of throwing up, a late doctor's app prescription i was off meds for 3 weeks and was super sick with migraines. i was just diagnosed with adhd, bpd, and ptsd and getting diagnosed possibly with more mental health stuff. with me being off meds and not eating i went crazy, i screamed and yelled and honestly have been arctic since. i'm curious if anyone else has delt with something similar? all i want is my husband back, and for things to go smoothly when we get to see each other i'm working on making the court date sooner hopefully. i'm curious if anyone else has delt with this before and if anyone has advise to help calm my anxiety and can help with my situation. i'm a very kind, sweet person, but my husband does deal with my uncontrollable abuse at times when i'm not on meds and or stressed. my two year old is with my parents for the few weeks due to just how everything played out and my anxiety is also overwhelming. please someone have something to compare to. i keep calling the mental health hotline, but would love to hear others perspectives. thank you",0
"i'm planning to kms on my birthday. it's august 3rd while i'm writing this and my birthday is in 12 days. i'm very young, but none of my birthdays have really meant anything since i was like 12. i know no one's going to remember or even care, like usual. but that's the least of my worries. i should be grateful for all i have. i live in an apartment that was given to me by my grandma since my step dad died and my mom got strung out. she sells drugs now and is even less of a mother than she already was. i guess i can say i've been through a lot. neglect, abuse, sexual assault..but honestly none of that really matters. it's the aftermath of everything that fucks me up. i have horrible mood swings. every single day, i go through periods of extreme anger and sadness. when i'm angry, i like to ruin things for myself. when i'm sad, all i can think about is killing myself and how unlovable i am. that gut wrenching feeling occurs every single day, but even when i'm okay. i feel so empty, nothing and no one can fill the void. i've made so many people hate me. i don't have anyone close in my family. my grandma pushed me into an eating disorder, and my brother sexually assaulted me. i have a best friend that i constantly ruin things with, even though they are my everything. no one can fill the void. no amount of pills, or alcohol, or weed, or whatever substance i choose to abuse this week will ever change the fact that i am so empty and alone. my thoughts won't stop and i don't know how to be okay no matter how hard i try. i don't know how to stop ruining things for myself. i don't know how to love people like normal. i don't even think i'm capable of being love or loving someone. and the people that tell me that the small things matter. getting out of bed, taking a shower, cleaning, amd taking care of myself in any way. that shit never works for me, and i don't understand why. i can do it, but it doesn't stop the consistent empty void i feel every single day. it doesn't stop the intense mood swing. i don't want to feel this anymore and i can only think of one escape. i attempted suicide in may. i survived, but everyone made it pretty clear how much they didn't care. i was put on lexapro, and i guess it kind of stabilized my mood. but i still felt so empty, so i stopped taking them. i went through the withdrawal and nearly lost my mind, but i'm still here. i haven't had therapy or anything since, and my first therapy appointment is on the 11th. but i can't tell anyone anything about the stuff that has happened to me without bringing some serious legal trouble onto my parents. and the things i can talk about seem so miniscule. i just don't know what to do anymore. i figured it would be best to do it on my birthday, so i can realize how unloved i am. anyways, thanks for listening. i needed to get that off my chest.",0

"does it really get better?. i struggle with life, the concept of living, just the idea of waking up another day when almost every moment of joy is just demolished by weeks of sadness. i have always been like this. i don't get this world , i just don't get the humans i interact with. why do i feel this immense sense of alienation like i am from another planet? i no longer even have emotions apparently, i can only feel the worry inside my guts, or my heart beating so fast as if it were about to explode. i can't even cry when i am extremely sad or miserable, i can't force myself to let my emotions out, not even by screaming out loud. can you really regain control over your own body after you've been abused? it really sucks how trauma works, especially when it's recent. you can't just think about something else after the incident. it really sucks when you put a lot of value in your studies and one week before an exam you just get the shit beaten out of you. you try to save the day by burying yourself under your studies, but that's not how trauma works, so instead you just show up to an exam completely absent minded. you feel like there's some sorta disconnect between your body and consciousness, like ""my legs are moving towards my seat, but my brain is somewhere else."" type of shit. your brain wants to confront the incident despite knowing goddamn well that it's not the time for such matters. now, even your most valuable activity has destroyed your self esteem, brought to you an immense amount of insecurities, you start to wonder whether you belong in this lecture hall or not. no matter how many people tell you how good you are at something you will never believe it when your self image is just distorted. yes, you remember your past, the good, the bad, and the ugly. you remember your achievements, you know some good things you have done, your self image is not some piece of shit human being, it's just a distorted image, you don't know who you are outside of your studies because you don't belong somewhere. you start to question your own choices, decisions, and preferences. you feel like a phony, not because you suck up to people, because you are probably lying to yourself, ""but how would i know since the only voice i listen to is mine?"" now, you are sane enough to understand that just taking the easy way out isn't a solution to your problems, you don't wanna quit, you wanna solve the shit you been dealing with. but does it really get better tho?",0

"making sure everything is spotless before i go. completely organizing, cleaning. i got rid of bags of clothes, and threw away many things. my drawers are nearly empty. i want to make sure that if i actually went through with anything, it d be easy to clear out my living space. no heavy lifting, no extra trash. i m leaving a few cardboard boxes for easy packaging if needed as well. the only thing stopping me is the fact that there are still things to get rid of. my due date is the 9th, i almost feel prepared. ive isolated myself enough that no one has even talked to me all year. i haven t met anyone new, haven t talked to old friends. the amount of people who will be affected will be small. im adding in my note that i don t want a funeral so there won t be any extra costs. i m going to clean my sisters old room since she moved out, so there will be less work for everyone. theres many more things i need to get rid of. the last thing will be myself.",0
don t know what to do. i m 2 in 15 days and ive been struggling for as long as i can remember. started off with anxiety at a young age which progressed into my long torment with eating disorders and i got diagnosed a year ago with eupd after trying to kill myself multiple times in the span of a couple of months. i have an alcohol problem and i m a burden to everyone around me. i lose my temper to easily and make everyone leave me. i can t imagine my life being anything other than this and i just don t see the point in anything anymore. currently downstairs sobbing and drinking whilst my boyfriend is asleep upstairs. forgive me because i don t really use reddit and i m not sure how this works. i just typed in suicide and this popped up. forgive me if this isn t what is supposed to be posted here. i just feel so alone,0

"i have been constantly getting suicidal thoughts due to my failure in social life. i am 23. i have a good successful career going and also have been mostly successful in academic side. but i am a complete failure in social life. i have no practical social life outside of work. not a single friend as such whom i hangout with. not able to had a single romantic relation ever. i also have lots of social anxiety and likely depression. i did try to work on my anxiety but not much success. no body wants me with them. i am the most boring person with no personality. i am a liability than anything. and being ugly with non existing personality is the best recipe of social life. even tried to pursue a person i had a huge crush on, but my lack of social skills and anxiety made me come off as a creep and failed there as well, making things even worse. cannot seek professional help as not easily available where i live and my low self esteem makes me think i am wasting time instead of working or studying for exams i am planning to give. lots of days recently suicide is the only way i can see ahead. even almost tried killing myself by hanging and once by suffocating. i cannot take this loneliness and anxiety anymore. it is especially worse on weekends, when most the people i know and are in similar position as me are out there having time of their lives. while my lonely ass is at home all alone. i am trying to keep positive, trying to delete negative thoughts. but is difficult. one day i am filled with positivity, the next complete opposite. seems i may end up killing myself in few weeks.",0

"my parents stole 1 years of my life and yet i'm the problem.. everything started going down hill after i moved back in with my parents about 1 years ago. why i moved back home was because i hurt my wrist and couldn't get time off from work, because i had already used my time the first time i was hurt within the same year. my room mate was over charging me on the rent, and i was going broke fast, then our home got robbed, twice. room mate blames me. i go back home. fast forward a year and i get a new job that i like, but then my mom gets cancer. i felt like it was my ""duty"" to take care of her since i am living here, but i couldn't balance my job and going to the doctor 5 days a week. so i quit. i spend 3 years taking care of her and she dies anyway, in my arms even. for some reason, my older sister gets 5 of the inheritance, even though it was me who sacrificed my life to take care of mom. my dad gets 4 , and me and my younger sister get 1 . now my dad is left alone, so i stay to take care of him. he also doesn't have his drivers license. sister buys a boat, dad pays off the house. i pay for an equal share of a giant tombstone, which cost about 5 of what i was given. i finally get back into work, have to explain to employers why i was unemployed for so long in my 2 s. the new job i work at is terribly filthy, like dust that smells of gunpowder and sulfur and it doesn't wash out. it's a night shift job. my dad doesn't let me sleep in the morning. i'm extremely unhappy, but i'm making enough to support myself, but idk how much i can keep this up. the smell, the itching, the lack of sleep. not worth 1 a week. then i have a hernia, my insurance doesn't cover me. i get put on light duty for 1 week. i have a panic attack at work during over time and leave. get fired. can't get unemployment. i coast on whatever i had saved up. i get another job that i really like with people who are cool. but i don't make enough to even cover rent if i were to move out. covid happens. my dad makes me quit my job, but says he'll support me, because he's afraid i'll catch covid being around people and bring it home with me. he's old and talks about dying all the time. it's not a good time. then my car breaks in half from rust. so now i only drive the family car, which belongs to my dad who can't even legally drive it. i ask for nothing, i drive him everywhere, i help with yardwork, i take care of the dog. i also still pay my phone bill, while unemployed, getting no income at all. draining my savings. but he'll support me, right? two years into this stupid pandemic. i'm out of money. he starts paying my phone bill but acts like it's such a massive burden and talks to me like i'm a gigantic failure. he says he doesn't need my help. he does. he still doesn't have his license to drive. he now has heart problems, isn't eating, won't listen to me trying to help. he complains about money, makes 3 a month retired, has my moms inheritance, 25 in the bank ""for funeral expenses"".. again with the dying talk. what am i doing here? what was all that for? i'm wasting my life for people who hate me. i'm a burden, a failure. how am i supposed to be independent ever? do i wait for dad to die? will he leave me anything? will i be homeless? can i find work ever again, at my age with my lack of experience and history of quitting? man... it feels like the best thing is for me to just not exist anymore. i haven't been suicidal in years, but this is really destroying me. if i cost so much to keep alive maybe i'll just stop eating. i'm not even allowed to have a fan in my room and it's 1 degrees. he blames me for heating up the house and making the ac run all the time. i'm sick of this.",0

"yeah... i'm over it. though i probably didn't appreciate it anyway, thanks for all you've given me . hey redditworld not doing so well, hence why i am on this sub. anyway, lets get into it, shall we? tl;dr: i'm so irrevocably bored of all this. can i please have a different challenge at this point? lately, i haven't been feeling the best, dealing with these niggling little fantasies about turning myself into something akin to roadkill lately. a part of the first degree murder i'd like to commit upon myself is to find a way to make my body disappear. or at least be hard enough to find so as to allow anyone who will miss me to find closure and or headcanon that i didn't gank myself. but that's neither here nor there... the reason for this post is that i've come to terms with the fact that i'll be making my exit soon. i was hoping to wait until 4 i'm 33 now , but now i don't know... i've stopped taking my meds, i probably going to stop going to my therapy appointments i just don't really see the point or importance anymore. been struggling with my mental health problems for over twenty years two thirds of my life and i feel like i haven't moved anywhere. i think about this the same way i think of my mother and her siblings. they are all in their 4 s 5 s, they all had trash childhoods and whatnot, but my mother was the only one able to pull herself up by her bootstraps, raise four children the fifth one died of crib death , spend much of her 2 s and 3 s being sucked dry by her parasitic siblings, and make something out of herself, and i'm really proud of her. but i also think about her brothers my uncles stuck in the same vicious cycles they've been stuck in for literally as long as i've been a part of this world. and i see this whole mental health struggle of mine turning into one of those vicious cycles. so... like i said, i've been dealing with this for twenty years at least. and it's not so much that i'm ""sad"" because i've grown bored of being ""sad"" , it's not so much that i'm angry because i'm bored of that too , nor am i particularly confused as that has also lost it's novelty too . i feel as though i've taken a step back and looked at all of this for what it really is, as far as what this particular individual is concerned. there really is no point to any of this. there really is no point. i've spent twenty years going back and forth with medications with all these side effects, and then i have to take two and three more medications to deal with the side effects of the first pill, and more pills to deal with the side effects of the pills that are supposed to stop the sided effects that started this whole geschichte to begin with. i've been back and forth with therapist after therapist who don't really have anything unique or interesting to say from one another. been back and forth with psych ward stays who pump me full of meds to ""stabilize"" me and send me on my way. been back and forth with myself, turning over a new leaf and finding a new outlook on life, only for that disingenuous outlook and view to drain me emotionally as i try to keep it up, and back and forth with the emotions themselves because that's literally what schizo affective bipolar is. been back and forth with friends and family, but same with the doctors: these hallmark greeting card platitudes, as well as all of these multi paragraph and multi faceted contradictions about why i'm supposed to stay here as everyone else's source of supply and validation, when i can't even supply to and validate myself. basically, i've reached a point in my life where i'm just completely bored with this whole struggle, i'm no longer fascinated with my mental health, and i'm tired of fighting the same challenger for a reward that doesn't even seem like its worth it anymore. don't know how long i have at this point. i was hoping for to wait for another seven years hell, i should at least allow myself that, right? , but last time i stopped my mental health treatment, i crumbled to dust in about three months. so... with that said, thank you for reading this far, i appreciate your time.",0
how can i survive while feeling like this?. its not even living at this point its more surviving dragging my body to another day. what did i do to deserve to feel like this? my life barely counts anything to me or others so i don't think i hurted anyone in the first place this shit is just not fair the only thing i wanna do now is lay my head on some rails and go to sleep not waking up forever i think i'll start walking towards the station. can someone tell me something nice please at least before i go?,0

"no time to call down. so lately life has been a bit shitty, with which i mean the last 2 months or so. i can't really call down to think about everything in detail, plus i feel pretty alone thanks to almost everyone i know not being available atm. i really need some physical attention, like hugging for a few hours. or atleast someone i can talk to. as to what has happened over the last 2 months. i had a cough for about a month, which now gave me some problems with my lungs. as far as i can tell it doesn't get worse through sports so i still go to my local gym, doesn't mean that i'm not worried, but if i don't go to the gym i'll feel worse mentally and same goes the other way around. you know what scratch that bs. i'm scared, scared of myself, scared of the future and scared of whatever this universe throws at me next. i just want to live a life after my own wishes, sure it might not be possible but it feels like i'll never make progress as long as i won't harm myself and i'm scared that that might in fact be how this world works. constantly something throws itself in my way. before these 2 months started there was constantly something new that hindered me from going to the gym, i was not able to go to uni almost half of the time this semester. and while all that is happening i can't stop pursuing my own goals, even though i might end up fucking everything up myself. and it's exhausting hearing everyone tell me that i am a good person, because i know that i am self destructive, i would rather die than give up my goals. and even though i know that, it still keeps going on. idk maybe i'll just give my body some rest the next few weeks.",0

"just want to offer others some hope.. first off, if you're reading this , i'm going to assume that you're feeling really down , maybe even suicidal. i want to say that i'm sorry for your pain and suffering. i suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts up until about 5 months ago. there is hope. as long as you tough it out , you're allowing for the opportunity to come for things in your life to get better. if you take your own life, that chance of your life ever getting better goes away. here's what's helped me get better. 1. medication this was probably the biggest game changer for me. i had severe depression for so long that my brain needed help to get back to being happy again. 2. try to change your perspective instead of being sad , try appreciating every little and big good thing in your life. write down all of the positive things that you can think of in your life , read it everyday as a reminder of you have to. 3. spend time in nature and in the sun both nature and the sun can improve your mood. fresh air is great. watching animals is a fun way to pass time. even going out at night to look at the stars is a good way to pass time. 4. journal when you're feeling down or even happy .. take time out of your day or week to journal and get your thoughts out on paper. keep it to reflect on , or burn it if you choose to. 5. cut toxic people out of your life this can help you feel a lot better. people that are toxic to you can potentially bring you down 6. take a break from social media and unfollow , unfriend , or even block people that you don't like seeing people on your friend's list that you are no longer close with or had a falling out with can really bring you down. it can also bring you down when you compare your life to their lives. remember, people only show you what they want you to see on their social media. 7. get enough sleep for me personally if i don't get enough sleep.. my depression can come back in full swing. i become irritated and sad. 8. hygiene keeping up with your personal hygienic needs.. like taking a shower and brushing your teeth before bed can really make you feel a lot better. 9. set goals either small or big or both 1 . time give yourself time. don't cut your life short over feelings that are temporary. i am not knocking your feelings , i am just stating what worked for me , in hopes that if you try these things , that they will work for you as well ",0

"what's stopping you from doing it?. for me it's my brother. poor guy shouldn't have to lose his brother at age 23. part of me also doesn't really want to die if i'm being honest. it's just that i've done so many mistakes so far in my life of 2 years along with having a pretty odd family that i can never really talk due to their backwards upbringing. i remember telling my father recently about a kid who commited suicide at college and he was like ""man what's wrong with kids nowadays, god gives you a life just for you to waste it like that smh"" etc. but i've been keeping a secret from them for months now that i'm too afraid to tell. if it gets out, i'll be sleeping on the streets and perhaps even disowned. all because they didn't let me do what i wanted with my life and never considered how important mental health is. depression is like a daily running joke at our house when even the slightest thing doesn't go right. ""they had no red onions left at the supermarket, it's giving me depression"". ""why couldn't you be a member of the supreme court like my friend's kid, it's giving me depression"" etc. ""why aren't you exactly like the 1 other cousins who got engineering degrees and all that"" and so on. i feel like my life could have taken a considerably better direction, not necessarily a much better one considering my family will remain the same but yeah. and it crushes me every single day for the past 1 years that it is how it is as pathetic as it is now.",0

""where is the ambulance?"" ""at trinity"" thats like whale beach to collaroy. i knew that was it id gone to far. all my own doing. i said ""tell them to forget about it"" i gave up and stopped trying to live i closed my eyes. flashed every car that went past they didnt stop i dont blame them but for someone else would have been danger. then all of a sudden blue red lights and im up into and away. thanks for saving me and if you dont see disappointed id be. my gaslighter became my hero my lifesaver what a cruel world. 5 hours later stitched up and shown the door. i took some shots of the dawn. in total shock still i am. all i remember is the acceptance the peacfulness. but i have learnt nothing. i gave a hug and devoted myself to my gaslighter. she went ballistic at me a few hours later. normal friends is what i need. not psychotic mirrors with teeth. the lonliness is worse than ever my concentration levels are going and i think of negativity. i feel cast aside for more important. i am no one and its hard to accept. i want to finish one thing. but i cant. i cant edit photos anymore the self doubt crushes me and i just give up. i need a reason i need a purpose. thanks fo letting me vent i cant hold this or hide it. i am in perpetual doubt and a grinning demon handing me the pain",0

"not feeling my best rn. this is my first time posting in reddit and really i don t know where i should tell this as well. life hasn t been great since 2 22 started. my dad was sick due to a heart defect and was in and out of the hospital and the hardest thing about it is i live in a different country from my parent s. when march started i started to loose interest on my academics im a 3rd year medical student and i started failing classes. april came my girlfriend broke up with me and i lost my friends from college because of her, admittedly i did have mistakes on that part since i broke down and started crying and getting angry at everyone of how she treated me. when may came i thought i was going to fail my classes and ended up being suicidal. i opened up it to my parent s but i don t think they understand how hard it is to have motivation to live. my friends and every relationship i have is very important to me and i never had any falling out with my past friendships or relationships with a significant other so this event hit me hard. i received numerous mockery and hateful speech because of what happened that one night when i broke down. i was ridiculed online and treated as shit. all i could do was say sorry and i really was and i already accepted if they cant forgive me and i cut off any communications we all have but i got news from other friends what they were saying about me. when june and july came i met a new girl who helped me through all of it but lately i don t want her to feel like im a burden. and eventually i failed my classes and got delayed a year from graduating because of my lack of motivation and lost of interest in studying. i felt i wasn t ready to become a medical professional at that point and my family lashed out on me to the point threatened to beat me up and disown me. note that i am a student that gets high grades and always on top of my class but this one event where i failed resulted in my family treating me differently. lately im so lost and i want to end it and the only thing thats keeping me from killing myself is the girl that helped me through this. i don t think she can handle me dying of suicide.",0

"i don't know if this post is gonna be long or not, i'm just gonna write whatever comes to my mind. so here it goes.. i've been depressed for about 5 years now. my life is in grey and black. i've lost interest in everything i once desired. everything seems pointless and meaningless. i wake up and my day is ruined, reminded by the fact that i have to bear the sadness and nothingness until i finally do it. you know that feeling when you are just sitting there and waiting for the bus to arrive? or you're standing in a line with a bunch of people, or you're broke and you're waiting for your salary. that's how i feel nowadays. i'm just waiting to die. sitting idly. waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting... i can't defeat my body. i've tried to kill myself 3 times in the past. every time, there is this force that keeps me from doing it. i just freeze at the moment. yet, i regret failing to do it every single day. i wish i had killed myself at the first opportunity. i am a living contradiction. i'm an enigma, a paradox. nothing makes sense inside of me. i yearn for interaction, connection to feel related to others, but i am inherently unable to relate with anyone. because of my personality deep down, i strive to be different than anyone else. and i hate the fact that i try to be different than anyone else. i'm alone on this whole earth, and the loneliness is killing me. i care for others, yet i don't really care about anything at all. i search for something that doesn't exist. i do things that i don't want to do. knowing that this world is just suffering, i am unable to relieve my self from it. i know that everyone has problems and i acknowledge that people have problems. but the thing is, i wish i had problems, i wish my life was dramatic, and i had ups and downs. i wish i felt fear, i wish i felt anxious. i wish i felt excitement. but i feel nothing, my constant state of mind is below a regular person's saddest day. my happiest day is below a regular person's normal day. whether or not i even want to be happy is an another story. deep down i feel like i want to be happy. but how can you yearn for something that'll never happen. nothing makes me happy. nothing makes me excited. i tried to get help, see therapists, and it didn't work. maybe the problem is just inherently in my mindset. i do not fear death. and i hope no one fears my death. because it's a good thing. i will finally do the only thing that i've wanted my entire life. i'll be nothing.",0

"phone service is done, just venting i guess. no money, phone is off, no car or driving privileges, live in the middle of nowhere with my mom. i failed her, i failed myself. i have all this stuff i have to try to sell, i guess a small garage sale will do it. i'd make a lot more selling online but i have no transportation or money for shipping so at most i'll get 5 of what my stuff is worth and that's just so it's out of everybody's hands. trying to figure out what i can fit in my backpack because i can't burden my mother anymore so being homeless is the only choice have left. on the other hand i might not have a choice but to stay with her because i am still on probation for a dui i got last year and i don't know how far away i am allowed to move or if i will have to start the required substance abuse counseling over again or how i will be able to comply with it. i have nothing, i have no one, i am losing everything, getting no value for anything i own because i don't have enough money to do things like sell my car through private sale properly. i don't even feel right having my mother pay for the fee to downgrade my liscence to a photo id. i don't understand why the photo id isn't free if you need it to participate in society. if i can't make it through the rest of probation due to no transportation or whatever i am afraid they will make me sit in jail for two months. everyone acts like it's no big deal but if that happens i will be even more lost and even more far away from anyone who could remotely help me. when you're done they just let you out with whatever possessions we're on you and you have to do who knows what. in an unfamiliar area with no map and no way to call someone to come get me. death is the only way. i cannot survive my own in a new area without anyone i know or without knowing where to go and no money or food. i wish i was never born. i have no one in my corner and i'm going to lose everything. i hate myself deeply. i want so desperately to see the solution to everything but there is none. the writing is on the wall.",0

"good morning bestie im having an episode. so, im not diagnosed. my last therapist and i suspected am schizoaffective but im unmedicated and kind of just floundering. i dont want to kms because my friend and i are moving into a place together this week and shes relying on me for my half of things. but holy shit its hard. im chronically suicidal, reality feels like its shifting and i want out so fucking bad. none of this is worth it. none of it even matters. its like playing a board game you hate so that your friends have enough players. i hate it, it doesnt matter who actually wins or loses or even plays, and every day i think about how much easier it would be not to. yesterday i spent two hours talking to the lifeline hotline and hours on the phone with my mom just trying to exist without hurting myself. ive been journaling, smoking, trying to distract myself, anything to not act on it but my ability to do that is wearing thin",0

"the only gun in the house being upstairs in my parent's bedroom has saved me more than anything else. the title explains itself. if there was a pistol, right next to me at all times, i guarantee you i would not be typing this message. i've had more mental breakdowns this past weekend than i've had in fucking months. these problems don't just come and go for me. they always leave a scar, that i've been refusing to acknowledge for quite some time. now, i'll acknowledge it. it hurts. everytime another mental breakdown starts, it always hurts more than the last and makes the scar bigger for it to hurt even more the next time. it hurts so much that if i was presented with the opportunity to off myself during any point these past few days, i would definitely take that opportunity in a heartbeat. but, it's never presented itself. always locked away in a closet, in a place i'm not supposed to be in. that fact has singlehandedly done more to prevent my suicide than half the shit i hear coming from others online. i've given up on most of my goals. i don't feel like preserving myself for any reason whatsoever. i deserve all this shit anyways. i've been a dick to the only people who could save me, and allied with those that beat me down to a bloody pulp. and then there's the fact that i'm worthless. thousands of people die everyday and the world moves on. adding to that list won't do anything. in 3 years, those that loved me will have been remember a false version of me, and those that see this post will forget i ever fucking existed in a matter of weeks. i may indeed be loved, but i haven't been true to anyone in years. they love a cardboard cuttout of a kid who claims to be a man, and they'll remember me as that, even when i'm gone. the truth is, the moment i'll be the most me i will ever be is the moment i pull the trigger and my brains splatter against the wall. that moment will be the one time in my life people will see me for who i am, realize all of the signs and signals i've been throwing at, connect the dots and find my true character, and they'll fucking ignore it.",0

i gave my brother the knife. me and my youngest brother 12 haven t been getting along this week. one of the things he says very often is i m going to stab you he s of course never serious. one of my more prolific thoughts is that of stabbing my stomach until i m dead. so when he told me again i m going to stab you i went to the kitchen and got out a butcher knife and handed it to him and told him to do it. he laughed. did i just mess up my little brother? am i a terrible terrible person?? i feel awful and shameful inside. luckily no one in my family knows how much i m struggling right now. if they did i m sure i would feel worse than i already do.,0

"i told my little cousin i was dating his favourite teacher and his reaction was adorable. context: i'm 21m, teacher is 22f, and cousin is 5m. almost two weeks ago i dropped him off at kindergarten orientation class because his parents were unexpectedly busy that morning. after helping him get his stuff into his cubby i was about to leave when he wanted to introduce me to the ""best girl teacher ever""...boy was he right about that title. stuff happened in between everything and eventually her and i started going out. i have never been in a relationship that has progressed as fast as this one has. in just a span of two weeks she went from being a gorgeous stranger to reminding my forgetful ass to take my adhd and vitamin b12 pills in the morning . not even my lovely parents do that which totally fair. after suffering from recent heartbreak, the death of my grandmother, and suicide of a high school friend, she's been the equation in my life i've so dearly needed in 2 22. just yesterday she sat down with me while i had a much needed, disgusting and overdue bawling session that i was not comfortable having with either my friends of parents. i felt like a baby but fuck was it necessary. we share the same sense of humour, enjoy similar movies, have nearly identical spotify playlists, bond over the same childhood nostalgia. and not only that but she runs her own part time photography gig which has literally been a goal of mine for years. i have literally found the female version of myself. all on top of that she looks like audrey hepburn so you cannot go wrong with that. it makes complete sense that this person would work with and educate little children. not many people have the patience and maturity for that and i totally see why my cousin likes her so much. enough of that. i was always nervous about the whole thing because my cousin looks up to her as his second mother. he literally calls her ""mrs mother"" for crying out loud . he sees me as the brother he never had and as a result i was overthinking stuff and worried that he would take it the wrong way or feel weird about it. don't blame me if this sounds like i'm freaking out over nothing, the last time i was 5 the iphone didn't even exist and gerald ford was still alive, that's how long ago it was. i completely forgot how blissfully unaware of anything complex people that age are. after talking to her about it as well my friends and some strangers online, interestingly enough, we both decided that today we'd ""come clean"" to him at the end of the day that his ""brother and mother"" literally how he describes us were k i s s i n g. i dreaded it the entire day during work and on the drive to pick him up but after finally pushing myself, she yes she, not we lol i was too scared and she decided to get it over with told him word for word ""your bhai brother in my bengali language, which she is also learning and i are boyfriend girlfriend"". to my absolute relief the kid lets out the biggest smile i think i've ever seen from him. he's literally speechless. i ask him what he thinks about it and all he does is jump up and down while laughing and clapping and then runs up to us for a hug. his two favourite people yes he told me that as well found happiness in each other. it was the cutest thing i've seen in ages. even hours later i called his mom and he's still jumping on his bed and calling her ""mrs sister"" . made me realize he's basically just a big baby and i wouldn't have it any other way. sorry if this sounds completely random to you but i've been telling everyone i know this so far so might as well fill in the internet strangers who also helped me come to my senses and realize i was overreacting as usual.",1

"what s one of the most powerful lines from a song you ve heard?. for me, i ll have to say it took the death of hope to let you go by slipknot. a line from their most well known song, snuff i say this because i have been looking into stoicism the last year and it always made my nose crinkle up in stubbornness when i heard the quotes cease all hope and you will cease to fear but upon listening to this song more deeply and being more open to stoicism i see now that it s not hope in of itself that is bad or should be given up but perhaps the sort of hope we attach to a desired outcome, fear of the future, a person, or anything outside of ourselves that is more harmful. hence it took him killing hope for this person and this relationship in order to let that person go and for them to finally feel free. sounds kind of brutal or perhaps a bit cliche but absolutely powerful the more i think about it and ruminate on it. how about you? : have a good day stranger",1

"is it wrong to try and talk to somebody about their feelings and personal life if you are doing it simply for your fulfillment?. basically i moved across country but when i went back home for a week earlier this summer i ended up hooking up with a a close friend of mine who told me she had feelings for me it was kind of random . i eventually told her i couldn t keep talking to her as if we were together because i started seeing another girl that i really had feelings for at the time, and am in love with now, and honestly i asked my friend out years ago and she rejected me but now i really am not interested in having a relationship with her outside of friends with benefits because i am not attracted to her in that way. anyways occasionally she will text me or call me because she is upset and wants someone to talk to but i usually don t engage because i honestly don t really care anymore. i live 3 miles away and hadn t seen her for 1.5 years before this summer, so it s hard for me to really talk to her about such things. anyways i was upset about something that happened with the girl ive been dating now and felt very lonely and depressed about a lot of things because i really don t have any close friends outside of her where i live. i ended up texting my friend from back home to see how she s doing because i know she s not in the greatest place right now but as i m talking to her i m starting to feel like a piece of shit because i don t care so much and am using it in a way to just talk to someone to cure my own loneliness",1

"is it weird to cuddle my toddler son while he sleeps?. he's about to be 3 later in august and i like to cuddle him. the mother and i aren't together so we switch off each week, maybe 2 or 3 weeks. i'm 26 and am currently living with family at the moment as is his mother, who's around mostly women girls and a baby cousin. when he's here i love to cuddle him alot. he's maturing more and more each time i see him and i know he won't be into cuddles for much much longer. he likes to cuddle when we watch tv; he'll lay sit next to me into my arm alot. i often hold him while he goes down for his nap and he falls asleep pretty fast; of course i'll put him down after and go do my thing, sometimes he puts himself to sleep for the nap. same with bed time however i tend to kinda chill with him, hold him, let him lay on me sometimes, run my hands through his hair, rub his back, give him kisses and tell him i love him, i'm proud of him, he's great, etc. sometimes we'll play with my phones flashlight with finger shadows or watch a show. sometimes read some. he usually goes off onto the other side of the bed when he's tired about to really fall asleep so i'll tuck him in with one of his stuffed animals lined up and give him a kiss and let him put himself to sleep. i respect his space and his wants. but sometimes during the night i'll come hold him in my arms and give him some forehead kisses and rub his back a little, just watch him dream or talk in his sleep he's too cute for a minute awhile and put him back down on his pillows. i dont know, some people could find it weird that a 26 year old father is doing that especially when they're just sleeping but i don't look at it like that, i just love him, want to enjoy the time when i can with him nothing is promised and no telling when he'll not want to , he's cute and i like to show him affection and give him good vibes and energy while he sleeps; maybe he'll feel them and give him good dreams too. i'm just wondering what you guys think? should i just lay off and save it for the day time with him or should i keep doing so as long as he's comfortable with it? i know parenting differs person to person, family from family, but i just figured i'd get other people's opinions and experiences with this because if i could be stunting his maturing or independence or something that's the last thing i want to do. thanks in advance i appreciate it, i'll try to respond back to everyone when i'm able to. hope everyone is having a great day night and the best safe vibes and wishes",1

"stressed out if my mind. just need to talk about things and breathe.. about a month ago, i moved halfway across the country to seattle. i can't quite explain why, but i've always wanted to be up here in this area. there's a lot of places i've really enjoyed seeing and there's so much i want to do there are some problems, however. first of all, i'm 'homeless'. i got a job lined up before i moved. they were so eager to have a new employee qualified and eager to work in the northeast that they offered to pay for an extended stay and cover some of my travel costs to start work a month earlier. fantastic i jumped on the idea, already with a few places in mind to move into, and took the opportunity to relax and take some extra time to find a good place to live. things were going great unfortunately, as i started the last week of my stay, everything up here runs a credit check before renting and mine came back with over 2 owed to collections that i was totally unaware of. part of it i totally forgot, part i thought had already been taken care of, but more than half was from an apartment three years ago that has given me more grief than anything. with that on my credit, my applications have all been denied. a week later, all of my debts are paid. unfortunately, the company will not pay for my housing any longer. i travel a lot and have the opportunity to stay at hotels with the company most nights , but it's impossible for them to justify it every night. i got a great deal on a few hotel rooms on the weekends, but i don't have any permanent home. my car registration is due next month, but without an address, i can't register it. i i broke my phone and can't get it replaced until friday. i felt like i was so careful and had everything in order. i had 6 before i moved, but it's quickly running low, especially if you consider rent and the deposit i need for a place. i'm struggling, though i do have enough to get back to my parents if i absolutely can't make it. i've found a few people looking for roommates soon , but not now . i'm just tired. i just want a 'home'. i just need a break.",1

i just thought of a random misunderstanding i briefly had when i was 7.. i remember hearing as a kid that toy story took five years to make. for some reason i misheard it as 5 years. i had this image of a man with a beard and a robe in ancient mesopotamia declaring a new thing called a movie would be created and it would be about toys secretly being alive. i then pictured generations of people slowly working on it throughout the years. i also pictured kings in the middle ages and people later on in the 17 s being sad they wouldn t live to see toy story even though it was mostly complete. i pictured the camera being invented in the 2 th century and the inventor being excited that thousands of years of work could finally be filmed as the ancient people predicted. i felt so fortunate to be alive at a time in 1995 when such a grand project could be completed but also sad that i wouldn t live to see toy story 2 in another 5 years.,1

"you ever get so obsessed with something that you want to surround yourself with reading about it even when you're not playing it, but so little content pertaining to is exists online so you're just stuck with endless thoughts and nowhere to put them?. it's a frustrating experience. some more mainstream things i often fixate on are donkey kong, pikmin, and tf2 all of these things have hundreds of thousands of fanart, discussion, quality videos, rom hacks or mods, merchandise, podcasts, and most importantly large communities of people equally as obsessed as me who want to discuss these things and are open to hearing my thoughts on them. what i'm really into right now is this vr game called gorilla tag. to keep a long story short, it's basically a vr game where you play tag as a gorilla, except the only way to move is by hitting your hands onto the walls floor to propel yourself. it's one of the greatest games ever made imo and i think in the future it'll be recognized as an important turning point in the history of vr gaming and maybe even gaming as a whole. it does have over 4 million downloads and upwards of 6 , people playing daily, but here's the catch in my 13 hours of playing this game, i think i've come across exactly 5 people who are over the age of 18. as a result, in game conversations are entirely with children, the youtube side of things is 99 mediocre boring youtube non content ""me playing with fans "" or ""gorilla tag but if i fart the video ends "" , the reddit side of things is all but dead and what little content is posted is typically repetitive and obviously posted by children, the discord is so populated that chat scrolls by rapidly and trying to have an actual conversation is pointless and these kids don't want to have the types of conversations i want to have. worst of all it seems like no adults out there have even heard of it. i've brought it up to a lot of people, and before i can even begin talking about it i have to explain the game, the premise, why it's fun, etc. and i don't wanna just go on and on for hours so after the long intro i typically pick up on them not wanting to hear about it any more. so my hyperactive brain just buzzes about these things and wishes i could get these thoughts out. it sucks do you have anything like that in your life? what is it? tell me a little bit about it, i'd love to hear ",1

"what do you think you d truly wish for if you found a genie in a bottle?. let s go with aladdin rules of no multiplying wishes, no resurrection, and no falling in love. i feel like the only really important rule is the first but we ll keep it classic. also feel free to skip or skim over my ramblings below and just give your answers, as i definitely got pretty carried away. i know this has been asked so many times before, but i always find it fun to read through people s thoughts and wishes, and to ponder mine. personally, even though i think about it way too often, i just really don t know. my first thoughts are always to maximize my wishes in some way, so sometimes i think my first wish would be to be all knowing, that way i could be better informed for my next two wishes. but like i feel like that d break my brain. i already suffer from having too zoomed out a world view, where it feels like most everyday things are just meaningless since our existence is hardly a speck in terms of time and space. i would love the ability to control the weather, because i love things like rain and storms and wind and fun cloud formations. but im 1 positive i would accidentally fuck everything up and cause untold devastation because i was feeling particularly moody and wanted to experience a hurricane. it also feels to me that no matter how positive i could try to make my wishes, there would somehow be a lot of negative consequences. and so many technicalities. i d love to wish for world peace for instance, but what all does that entail? is it just no violence, or no disagreement? because we kinda need disagreement for progression. and as much of a peace loving person as i am, i still recognize that there have been times where violence may have been called for, or something that some view as violent others view as part of life, like hunting for instance, which humans have been doing for many tens of thousands of years. even something as specific as no violence between humans could have consequences that we ve never considered, because we ve never not had interpersonal violence. and then there are answers that don t break the wishing rules but could break the rules of physics and the universe. like the ability to form and control atoms or control time or something. would be fun to play around with, but that s an insane amount of power that again, could have powerful consequences. ugh, i m too indecisive and scared of monkey paws what do you all think?",1

"the time i was accidentally a creep. this was many years ago, i think i was like 19 or something like that. some context to start. i used to live in a very small apartment complex next to a very expensive gated house community. this community had the fame of being a place where criminals would live since it s been historically quite expensive, and so most people tried to not get involved as to not get into trouble. one day i noticed one of the houses had a chained colombian red howler monkey on their rooftop. these monkeys are wild animals and it is illegal to keep them as pets. i wanted to report this to the environmental police, but i wanted to do it anonymously because, as i mentioned, that community was rumored to be inhabited by criminals, and if they were willing to keep a wild animal as a pet despite it being illegal, i did not want to risk it and let it be known it was me who reported it. i needed the address, which was easy to get, and i needed the house number, which wasn t as easy because i couldn t see it by myself there were shrubs and vegetation covering the fence that divided our complex from their community , and i was scared to ask the guard at the guard. one evening i saw a couple of kids playing next to the fence, so i got an idea. we have a dachshund dog that my sister and i would take out on walks around a complex, and there was a small hole in the fence next to where the kids where playing, so i told the kids that my dog escaped through that dog and asked them if they d seen a little black long dog. when they said no, i told them that i saw him running towards that house with the monkey, and then asked if they d be so kind to tell me the number of the house; they did, and so i was able to report it and no more than a week later the monkey was gone. it was later on that i realized how creepy i had been with the kids. they were like 7 or 8, playing by themselves, when this 19 year old girl beckons them through the shrub to ask them about her lost dog. at least my intentions were good and the monkey was saved lol.",1

accidentally put fork in microwave. hi guys my dumb morning brain accidentally put a fork in the microwave and i saw a spark so i quickly removed it. but the microwave has a small horizontal grey line that i cant wipe off. 1. anyone knows how i can remove that mark? and does it affect the use of the microwave in any way? 2. the microwave is still covered under the warranty period but i'm afraid the manufacturer wont accept it since its probably considered misuse.. anyone knows how i can cleverly phrase it so they'll allow it for a warranty claim? thanks ,1

"is the ""hustle life"" a sad one?. to start things off, i fully support working hard to achieve what you want in life. it's okay not to be content with what you have, and i'm certain there are people who's satisfaction comes solely from working and building their life... but for some, shouldn't there be a happy place to stop? my idea is that if you ""hustle"" your entire life because you want the next best thing, you want the biggest house, live all of your childhood fantasies nothing wrong with it , some of us will never find that happiness and content place in life. constantly grinding to do something bigger and better implies that what you've done may not be good enough. what're y'all's thoughts on it? i know personally, i'll be happier if i don't chase every idea i've had. they say to live without regrets... but chances are that life will leave you regretting not enjoying taking the time to enjoy what you accomplished. agree, disagree; i want to know how reddit feels",1
"i wish me and my dad got along more. my dad, has seen all the ups and downs of life since his childhood. as far as i have heard, it's not been easy, but rather filled with struggles and pain. which sometimes makes me wonder, is that the reason why he is what he is today ? my dad is the complete opposite of me, not so open minded, gets angry on every little thing, leads a routine and monotous life, doesn't get enough sleep, is always lecturing me about something or the other, etc etc. my relationship with him hasn't exactly been so wholesome and good, even since childhood. i am much closer to my mom, my dad ? not so much. i feel like our relationship keeps getting worse and worse every now and then. even since childhood, he's never understood me or my problems properly, and i don't blame him to be honest. he has tried his best, but he never got me. i hate saying this but i have always seen him as a villain. always angry, always so strict for no reason, always a bit sexist in his views, blah blah blah. and, yet again, i have no rights to deem his a villain completely because he has fulfilled every wish of mine till now. every single thing i asked for or didn't ask for has been bought for me. everything from expensive clothes, shower watches, books and more. i feel that personally, i am much more priveleged compared to the kids i have seen so far in my life. yet there exists an awkwardness between us, more from side than him. i can tell my mom my deepest secrets and so on, yet i really hesitate with talking to my dad even for the smallest things. it sucks. i don't why, but hugging my father feels like the hardest thing to do in the universe. i can accomplish the most impossible tasks, but hugging my father is really really hard. i also the hate fact that every single object i own till today has come from my father's money. i want to be financially independent soon. anyways, sorry if the wall of text seems incongruent and random, i don't really know how to express my self like some of yall do so professionaly here xd",1

random memory i remembered. one time i was playing hide and seek with my dad and we couldn't find him for a while and we had checked every room in the house extensively. i had a feeling he was hiding jn the bathroom so i kept walking in to check and couldn't find him. eventually i walked in to check again and decided to look up and there he was on the ceiling holding himself up by pushing the four corners of the walls with his hands and feet. said he waited behind the door till he heard someone walking then would climb back up and wait.,1

"i think i just figured out my purpose in life.. i 2 m was having a conversation with a family friend 55f whom i occasionally hang out with and talk to. i've been working at my old childhood elementary school for the last 2 years, basically since graduating high school, and now i'm moving up into a higher paying job at a different school. i work with all ages, but the kids i've always liked to work with the most are the younger ones in preschool, kindergarten, or first grade. their innocence and general sweetness cuteness genuinely feels therapeutic to be around. i would always try to make time to go play with the little ones during recess or lunch, and they loved it. one game they loved for a long time was being cops holding me captive in pretend jail, for a sentence of ""forever"" or 1 years. she already knew all of that, but i also opened up about my family's past history of trauma: dad started dating mom fresh outta jail in 1998, and was on drugs when i was a newborn infant, my older brother 31 went down a path from age 1 or so of being easily angered and aggressive, and eventually getting into drugs as an adult, my big sister then 19, now 33 died when i was 5, parents marriage started deteriorating when i was 6, my dad got back into ice when i was 9, lots of fights and screaming and stuff being thrown, and then my parents divorced and it took my dad 9 years 2 12 to 2 21 to come back to our hometown after he moved away to get clean because my mom said she wouldn't let him see me anymore if he didn't . it wasn't so much being afraid or being in physical danger that got to me, as it was just being around constant shouting, anger, conflict, and negative energy. and the kicker thing is: the kids i work with that i tend to have the strongest bonds with and spend the most time with and get the most hugs from? i would come to learn overtime that those are the ones that are currently growing up in families with constant anger and shouting and negative energy, just like mine. i can name at least 3 or 4 right off the top of my head, and this school has 85 kids its one of 4 elementary schools in a town of 7,5 . basically, the conclusion she came to is that the reason why i love playing and helping out with little kids as much as i do is because i don't want any of them to grow up with the kinda angry toxic stuff i saw with my family as a little kid, seeing them smiling, laughing, and knowing that i make them happy and have a positive effect on their lives gives me a sense of self worth, and being around their innocence and kindness gives me a safe haven to be free from the negativity of the world. and hearing that honestly just made me tear up. i feel like i just unlocked my entire purpose in life. she also said that she thinks the asperger's diagnosis i was given as a 3yo to explain why i was always screaming and crying as a baby, always seemed sensitive to everything and scared of everything, and hardly talked to people as a toddler, probably wasn't autism at all . she thinks i probably have anxiety or a nervous tick that was embedded into me as a baby hearing my parents fighting and yelling all the time, and that i articulate and function way too well to have autism.",1

"anyone else develop a special interest s because of a friend?. i've been applying for vet school, so lately i've been doing a lot of thinking about my life and what led me to where i am. i can't write about this particular experience in my application because they discourage talking about childhood, pre high school stuff. even if i could, i also don't think it would be the most relevant story to tell in my application. so i thought i would share here: i had a friend from 4th 6th grade who was super passionate about gray wolves and her enthusiasm about it was freaking infectious. she even convinced me to try and send an email to the president at the time about gray wolf conservation, which i was literally about to do until my parents convinced me otherwise. i carry that passion with me still today and a lot of the things i love like camping and the outdoors hunger games was so big at the time, we tried to do a full reenactment of the games in the woods came from spending that time with her and the rest of that friend group. we're still friends to this day, i moved to a different school after 6th grade but we reconnected at the end of college. it was like no time had passed, which is pretty crazy because that rarely happens in all the friendships i have had. we're on very drastically different career paths at the moment and she's going to school in a different country, so i feel a bit sad that it'll probably never be the same as it was but happy that it happened. i really hope she knows what a positive impact she had on my life and how grateful i am to have her friendship. sometimes i wonder if she felt the same way, did i impact her life the same way that she did? maybe sometime i'll ask her, hopefully i'll see her again in the near future ",1

"my experiences with adults growing up made me realize how important it is to ponder time, it s value, and what kind of attitude i d like to go about life. i recognized very early on that i could ve been born anything or anyone. that no matter what form i could ve taken on this earth, i will experience pain. being able to walk, see, and perceive was amazing to me. to be the eyes and the ears for trees, both a giver and receiver of the oxygen i breathe. i realized it is a privilege i get to experience earth in this form. as early as 1st grade, after learning of the stunning probability that went into me meeting this world, i can remember feeling gratitude for everything that came before me that made it possible for me to even be here. so many adults fear death and inflict unnecessary pain on to others not necessarily for the pain they inflict to cope with their own pain, but for the time they ve wasted of others that neither parties will ever get back. sometimes the things they do to cope with death and fear often inspire more fear and so the circle continues. nobody wants to leave this place but finding a way to be okay with it through gratitude for all the hard work and all the time the universe, nature, and people gave of themselves just for me to walk makes me so happy, even if i could only exist for a day. and to realize in 1st grade that i get to wake up and explore the very soil that birthed me for far more than just a few days? such a basic fact left me in awe of my sheer luck. this perspective helps me navigate extremely rough circumstances. it affords me so much more room to understand my surroundings be able to give a healthy dose of benefit of the doubt to others. i get so much more out of my life no matter how much pain is inflicted on me or witnessed because i get to live inside this brain that affords me so much. because of this perspective, my physical neurological pathways feel that people s actions and the pain they inflict physically and mentally do not belong to me, therefore they can t physically hurt me entirely. i wonder what i d do or how much more pain i d be in if i hadn t formed this ideology approach to life. therefore i cannot judge because i do not know what it s like inside another s head. does anyone here feel some adults make their fear of death their child s problem? to then inspire their children to fear death through showcasing unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking or abuse in order to find control? everyone loathes the idea of leaving but not everyone practices unhealthy coping mechanisms. does anyone here not fear death entirely and want to make space for their children to not fear it too? do you have any philosophies practices that help you not fear death? thank you for reading if you ve made it this far ",1

"if you don't define your life and or self worth by your career, hobbies, or relationships, what should you define yourself by, if anything?. i do a lot of introspection, and i often wonder how i should define my sense of self. some people define themselves with their career, a hobby, or their relationship ie. spouse and kids . but i've seen criticism for each of these things; namely, self help advice that ""you shouldn't define yourself by your career hobby relationship etc."" usually, this advice is in the context of supporting someone who is struggling with one of these things unsuccessful job hunting, not having an interesting hobby, recent break up, etc. . because honestly, if you ask me, i think most people in the world do define themselves with one or some of these things. so how would you define yourself, and why do you choose to define yourself in this way? personally, i've always somewhat defined myself by my hobbies. discovering and developing new skills hobbies take up a big part of my time. i just love learning new things plus i'm an only child, so i've had the lifelong habit of needing to entertain myself. i like that hobbies are things i can take initiative with, that i have reasonable independent control over; hobbies are very ""mine"" i don't need to depend on someone else to make them a success. i also like to define myself by how i impact the world around me. this can lead to some neuroses, admittedly, because i'm quite critical of myself. i often worry about whether i really am a positive force on other people, or whether other people like me, all that juvenile stuff. however, i also think defining yourself just means knowing yourself and accepting yourself as you are. this is something i still need a little more time to work on...",1

"i feel that most body positive influencers do more harm than help. we ve reached a point where an attractive woman with a stomach roll or two will position themselves as a body positivity martyr; where they will upload a photo without a filter still from a flattering angle ; where they will reveal themselves looking slightly bloated after dinner and get flooded with adulatory comments commending their bravery in many cases it s a form of virtue signalling, and i feel it only exacerbates the underlying issues, and causes beauty standards to feel even harsher than they are. consider: if a conventionally above average looking woman has built her entire online persona around flaunting her two rolls of fat and three cellulite dimples and consequently been praised to high heaven, how rotten must a conventionally unattractive woman who s considerably overweight feel? if the good looking woman has forged her image around having slightly asymmetrical breasts and small love handles then the unattractive woman showing any skin at all is automatically considered a sign of bravery, right? it s indirectly reaffirming what she already bloody sees every time she catches herself in a reflection: she s so very far from being conventionally physically desirable how is this helpful in any way? so then, how should somebody with a sincere body positive mindset help to redress the harsh societal beauty paradigm? they could start by dropping the body positive bullshit in their bio, by refraining from appending every post with a glib sentence about self love, by not pinching their belly rolls in every goddamn photo and hyper focusing on the fact that they aren t physically impeccable according to the beauty paradigm or drawing attention to the fact that they aren t using a filter, and instead just uploading photos which tacitly demonstrate this real confidence. in other words by being a normal person not a self appointed martyr. all moral grandstanding aside i m sure their heart is usually in the right place, however their head is not, and it s no wonder that more of my female friends suffer from eating disorders than ever before. feel free to disagree",1

"i'm the most productive i've ever been since starting night shift. i actually cook now . most people claim night shift is terrible, people would even try to talk me out of switching over because they assumed i'd hate it. even in night shift facebook groups it seems nightshift is generally disliked and seen as only a plus because theres usually a pay differential. i know im obviously not, but it feels like i'm the only one who genuinely prefers it lol. day shift was brutal for me. i was constantly exhausted. i'd get up, go to work, and when i got home i didnt have the energy to do anything. i would be fighting to keep my eyes open all day, and by the time i got home it would be a losing battle. i lived off of lean cuisines, everyday i would zombie trudge to the microwave to heat up my daily meal. but at the same time, i would lay awake at night because my brain just wouldnt drift off to sleep. i needed heavy combination of sleeping pills just to get any form of sleep. i still take .5 mg of xanax to sleep because my tinnitus amp; brain just not shutting off keeps me up for hours if i dont, but it's much less heavy than what i used to take. i started working overnights in may and it has been life changing. i work 11 pm 7:3 am. this is usually my schedule now obviously it can vary but this is the basic outline : 8 am: arrive home. make my husband a breakfast or salad wrap he is a truck driver and works long days, he usually wakes up and goes directly to work so i make something he can quickly grab and eat . refill my bunny's supply of hay. 9 am: go to bed 11 am: husband leaves for work, since his alarm usually wakes me up too i get up to shower or whatever quick thing i have to do before going back to bed like if i'm making chicken and vegetables, i'll marinate the defrosted chicken and put it back in the fridge. if i need groceries, i'll send a curbside pickup order 3 or 4 pm: wake up. head to the grocery store to pick up the order. pass time by watching tv or playing video games. 6 pm: begin cooking dinner. other housework that has to be done like change bunny's litter box if it needs to be, take out trash, fold laundry i didnt get to. 7 or 8 pm depending on when i finish : pass more time 9 pm: start getting ready for work, make my sandwich even if i cook i bring a sandwich, my husband gets home atleast an hour after i leave and he has a big appetite since he doesn't have a chance to eat from being in a truck all day, if theres leftovers i bring them to work the next day , feed my bunnies their dinner salad. my biggest concern with the desire to start cooking was thinking of things to make everyday but i caught on quickly with coming up and keeping track of my ideas. i still deal with bad fatigue, honestly on my days off i usually sleep in until the time i usually cook dinner besides getting up to change out the laundry, days off are laundry day then go back for another nap around 4 am. but i'm actually able to do things now, unlike when i worked days and did nothing else but work and fight to stay awake.",1

"as a person of asian descent, i hold asians at a higher expectation due to my upbringing.. in asian culture, an offspring's behavior and conduct are often a reflection of their parents or guardians. it is shameful to be rude or cause unnecessary disruptions in public because it is considered disrespectful to one's parents. i believe the collectivist ideals and elements of east asian culture have been ingrained upon me at a very young age. another interesting cultural concept is called ""saving face."" this concept essentially boils down to keeping others from losing respect for oneself or to avoid embarrassment. this is why japanese people in modern times are known for their humility and respectful behaviors towards others. for me, whenever i see an asian who is rude and disrespectful, i immediately direct my judgement towards the parents. in my mind, it may be that this hypothetical person's parents did not raise them properly. this is a contrast to u.s. american culture, but as someone who was raised in an asian household, it was what i was taught. my parents would always point out a bad person on the news as asian if they were of asian descent. that was the first thing that they zero in on because the notion of asians behaving badly is not something that is normal to them. as such, i have begun to study american and asian culture. the dichotomy of asian and western culture presents an interesting train of thought.",1

"redditors from cold places, what do you do for winter that doesn t cost a fortune, like a whole room full of winter gear would?. i ask because the midwest is going to get an unreasonable winter according to the old farmer s almanac, and this summer was so ridiculously hot that i would probably agree with someone from the south, about what s hot, so cold may be the same way for us. it is 8 degrees, and feels like room temperature or even a tiny bit cooler, because the wind is blowing, and the sun is not shining hard. i can t believe it s 8 degrees, and that it feels almost cool. this winter, right after an unreasonably hot summer, will suck. and the economy won t let me stay warm the mechanical way aka can t buy extra winter gear, lots of it, new because i already have some but it s better for normal winter weather and not this . the economy sucks too.",1

"i just read a 82 year old comic book. i was looking through the big bookshelf entire wall in a big room in my parent's house, and saw a badly damaged comic book i remember from childhood days. the title was in s tterlin script, a writing i once learned reading and writing but forgot by now, the comic titles are in gothic script both s tterlin and gothic script were banned in 1941 and not reintroduced past 1945 . i googled the name of the comic and realized it must have been 194 as that was the only year these comics were published as book. i'm not sure how this comic book ended in our family, as by 194 my father as the oldest child was too young for this. maybe my grandparents or he bought the comic book much later. it was the ""5 schreckensteiner"" three paintings on a wall with 5 ancestors relatives one woman, one boy and three men of the current lord of a castle. every night between midnight and 1 am the people in the painting come to live they are well aware of their surroundings all day though to play pranks, do everyday things or secretly help the lord of the castle. interestingly enough almost everything worked just as good as today, except a misogynistic one which would rightfully raise a giant shitstorm today. what was the oldest book comic you ever read? here https: i.imgur.com osiaou3.jpg is a random sample from the book.",1

"how can one deal with overthinking slow reactions in real life?. today, i felt incredibly dumb and incompetent. this elderly woman was getting on the bus and she had a bag in one hand. i was watching her and wanted to help her but i was trying to figure out how to help her onto the bus since i didn't really know exactly what to do. she had her hand on the railing and was slowly working her way up onto the bus so i also didn't want to sabotage or make it worse. this guy behind me walked in front of me to help her up, took all of her bags, and confidently got her onto the bus faster. i let her have my seat but i just felt very incompetent and felt like i didn't know how to properly or efficiently help her in that situation. there is definitely anxiety involved since i almost killed an old woman at church when i was 6 since all of the adults trusted me to buckle the elderly woman up to the chair lift. because of that, i tend to overthink and overanalyze things in the heat of the moment, which usually just leads to me being incompetent. it also doesn't help that i also struggle to maintain a strong awareness of my surroundings, often zoning out mentally in moments where my attention may be important. have you guys had this experience before? and how do you deal with it?",1

"habit of spacing out. when i'm bored or not doing anything, i like to stare into nothingness. sometimes, while listening to music. it's fine when i'm doing it in my room since i can go on for however long i want it to be. but after some time, it gets suffocating inside the 4 walls of what should be my safe space. so then, i have to go out atleast once a week to refresh my mind. either i go by the harbour, or the mall, usually the latter. my routine is pretty simple, go to the mall, eat, buy clothes once per month is what my allowance allows me to , and then finally rest in a coffee shop for a few hours before going home. i like coffee, not like a hipster, or a connoisseur, i just like it like the average person. i like it, but for some reason, it messes up something in me, like i become more aware of everything around me, or a feeling like something bad may happen to me, and then i'd feel like shit sick a few hours later. what i do like about it is the act of drinking it. i like taking my time when drinking coffee, it takes me atleast 1.5 hours before i finish one venti sized coffee. again, i like staring into nothingness alot, that includes when i'm drinking coffee. but unlike when i'm in my room, i can't do it in my pace, in public. because there's people around me. i know they're not looking at me but sometimes when they do, i know they're thinking that i'm weird staring into the void, alone. it did happen back in 9th grade, after our semester break, i remember going back to the classroom just staring into... well, nothing. my classmate noticed me from a distance and then he snapped me back to reality and saying ""hey, you've been zoning out for atleast 15 minutes now, are you okay?"" then i laughed and said yeah mb. i like staring into nothingness, i think its more meta than forcefully closing my eyes, somehow, that is more tiring. when zoning out i occasionally find out that i have been staring at someone without me knowing. thats why it messes me up. what if i was accidentally looking at someone? they will think im weird, im into them, and then what? ill end up in social media either having sad music and the caption is about a guy being alone, or a pervert staring at me. sometimes, i imagine having the power of clipping out of reality whenever i want, or being invisible. so then nobody would judge me for being weird and staring carelessly. i know i shouldnt care at all, im confident enough being alone, eating, or walking alone. i like being by myself because theres no constraints. i just wish i can drink my coffee in public and stare into nothingness without these thoughts.",1

"it finally happened. i love vegetables now.. to be clear, i never hated veggies. my parents god bless them made sure that we always ate healthy, but once i lived on my own i decided that veggies are optional especially during my college years, i never touched salads and got into some very poor eating habits even though i liked to cook. recently i started watching this show alone, and it blew my mind how much we take food for granted. folks on the show were starving even when they had meat, just because their diet was crazy imbalanced with proteins and barely any fat. it made me think about how i eat, and since then i just crave having different things in my meals healthy amount of carbs, protein, and veggies all mixed together. it's like a festival in my mouth every time i get a bite of meat with that crunch of fresh veggies right next to it. i fucking love vegetables now.",1

"can we talk about cereal?. i went to stop and shop today looking for an evening snack and thought hey you know what i haven't had in a while, breakfast cereal. i don't eat breakfast but i thought it might be a good snack when i come home from work since i can't eat much during the day there besides chicken some rice and broccoli. which sucks. so anyway going down the cereal aisle i was hoping to see some old favorites like honey smacks, french toast crunch or even corn pops which i was always on the fence about. but there was none of that. there was cheerios, 14, different fiber cereals, cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms. now i know all those fiber cereals are healthy and whatever and that's great but i eat healthy all week so i wanted to indulge a little. oh and i think frosted flakes were there but i never liked those. i think those pebbles were too. i just wasn't feeling it. so i think eh alright i'll check out the cracker aisle. but even there there's like a thousand varieties of ritz which didn't excite me. chip aisle has options but i'm a little worn out in chips plus its really unhealthy. so back to the cereal i went. i ended up with a cereal called krave which was like 5 and turns out it's mediocre at best. what was your favorite cereal as a kid and if you still have cereal do you miss the days when there tons of great options?",1

"are you a person who is more attracted to little details about an individual person, or a specific feature on every person?. to clarify, i am female, and attracted to anyone so long as they are my age. i tend to notice little details about an individual, and that clues me in to parts of their personality, which makes them attractive. for example, i might notice well manicured hands on someone who clearly works a messy or harsh job, implying they take extra care of themselves. my friend, by comparison, is a butt guy, and claims there are no bad butts. he doesn't care what they look like, and claims he can appreciate all of them. we jokingly disagree deeply on this. it's a running gag. while there are certain standards that the majority find attractive, i wanted to hear more about what each of you, as an individual tend to notice or if you have some kind of universal preference as my friend does. i suppose this really boils down more to a question if are you more attracted to everyone with a particular trait vs each person as an individual... idk, i'm rambling.

"how does time travel work?. i have been thinking about this a couple of times now this is mostly past related to make it less complicated : is there a feasable way to percieve time? we all know that time passes and can see it happen in front of us but can we really determine how time works? this would be directly linked ? with the concept of time travel i like this topic . the way time travel would or wouldn t work highly depends on the way time actually works: 1.a fixed timeline where everything that has ever and will ever happen has somehow ben predetermined, even occurences of time travel a good example for this would be the time watch thing from one of the harry potter moovies 2. no fixed timeline, your decisions influence the current state of your timeline, this can take various different forms: 2.1 its always one continuous line, time travel creates an infinite loop, you time traveling causes the version of you that time traveled to never have existed in the first place override of your timeline causing you to never have traveled to the past and change the timeline. 2.2 alternatively you could create a branch timeline no override where you decided to time travel to causing you to be an extra in this time since you re from another version of reality . this brings up the question if every decision you make or don t make branches off into an alternative timeline making it hard to pinpoint a time to travel to since there are almost infinite possible pasts to consider .",1

"i am finally proud of myself. i thought i can post it here expressing that i am finally proud of myself. i cant say that my parents abused me and they did they best they can to raise me but all they did my whole life was working so much that they never spend time to get to know me. they always thought i just want to be lazy, play video games, listen to music and just slack off my whole life but in reality, i really wanted a figure. i went to community college right when i turned 18 while still living with them and i still feel like im 12. felt like my life wasnt taken seriously to advance being an adult. i worked a lot but still didnt advance so i felt i had to dorm in a university to not only get college experience but to get away from my parents. i did exactly that at 23, lived away from them for 2 years and had exactly what i hoped. but graduating college at 25 was so depressing, i lived with my parents again because the job i had wasnt well paid and it lead me to depression because they thought i wanted to be lazy again so they tell me to clean and take care of the house while im not doing anything. a year of that and i snapped. i wanted to make the most incredible story of how i needed nobody but myself and start being an adult. i had two friends who were in a similar situation to move into the city so i took that as a sign to take the leap of faith. i lied to my parents saying that i had a friend who paid off 3 months of his rent, had to move so gave me permission to live in it. i couldn't believe they fell for it but still said it's a bad idea. i didnt listen and moved in with the little money i had. i then became a rideshare driver to make ends meet and it was an emotional roller coaster. i took side jobs that wernt full time, delivered food and online tasks all while still trying to find a reliable, full time job. i still went traveling to remind myself that i have purposes in life and it felt great. but then one day i picked up someone from rideshare and we had a great conversation. long story short, he was a manager at a hotel and said he can try to connect me with the department that's searching for the type of job i was looking for. i took it. it wasnt full time but it paid great to get me off rideshare. then that experience brought me to work at a hospital. then a an office that specializes sports clothing apparel and then it brought me to work at a start up tech company and now i am working it's competitor getting paid 8 k a year. next thing you know, i have a girlfriend, a house, a dog, and just a few months ago, a beautiful son. i did all this myself and respectfully without my parents. i still have more goals to accomplish but right now, im so happy where i am and cant wait to see what else i have in the future.",1

"d amp;d players of reddit, how long did it take for you to become a dice goblin?. most people who know me at least somewhat well know that i'm a sucker for shiny objects and can't resist having them, and glass art specifically is something i passionately collect and hoard. naturally, when i discovered all the fancy dice on etsy which i use for cosplaying , i just couldn't resist. i started playing d amp;d last year, and i think it started when i was given a pouch full of five dice sets for christmas. however, i didn't buy any other dice until otakon 2 22, when my love of shiny objects took over and i bought three dice sets. since then, i've had the irresistible urge to buy more dice. i already have three more dice sets, to the point where i bought a case so that i can store and display them all. with my roguish love of shiny objects, art hoarding tendencies and access to etsy, i suppose it was only a matter of time.",1

"memory foam mattress: the best and worst choice i ever made.. i got a memory foam mattress as a christmas gift from my parents that past season. those first few weeks with it in the cold were bliss and it was so soft yet firm. then the spring takes an extremely quick turn into a scorching summer and it becomes a deal where i occasionally wake up in a warm sweat and it also starts to sag in places though it firms right back up after staying off it for a few hours. admittedly a tmi thing but it s also made my slight hemorrhoid issues into more prevalent occurrences which is my biggest complaint. all this being said, i still think this mattress is worth it. those comfortable winter early spring sleeps with a cold firm bed really make your worries melt away. needless to say it seems my experiences with my mattress are going to be seasonally dependent but i m willing to take it all in stride. anybody else out there in a similar situation? how have you dealt with memory foam trapping as much heat as it does during the warmer months? as always any and all input is welcomed and thanks for reading ",1

"the looney tunes show is a masterpiece. the looney tunes show that ran from 2 11 to 2 13 is an absolute masterpiece and i savour episode while watching it back. the psychology of all the characters from bugs bunny to lola to daffy and tina are so fascinating. like, daffy is a grade a narcissist. he conned his friend porky pig into giving him 375k to buy a yacht on the pretence that it was for a kidney transplant and when porky found out and was about to beat his ass, he said that he didn't tell him the truth because porky wouldn't have given him the money. porky said that he wouldn't have and daffy's response was ""so how am i the bad guy here?"". not to mention the episode where they flashed back to high school and showed a massively inverse relationship between porky and daffy. maybe porky feels so guilty that this is why he lets daffy take advantage of him? deep down i would love for a professional psychologist to do an analysis on all the characters. feel free to share your own thoughts if you've watched the show ",1
"just wanted to share some personal good news. since early 2 2 , i've been wanting to enter into a coding boot camp called lambda school now bloom insititute of technology to change into a new lifelong career in tech. i was paying off my debts, and saving up money to move to a new city denver , where i would work part time and be in a boot camp. then covid hit. i had to slow down work because i was living with my parents at the time, and limit my exposure to the public my job was a grocery delivery driver . this slowed down my savings and delayed my move denver was a hot spot for covid , but i was still adamant to start the boot camp. then i got diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in june. i had to completely stop working. changed my life completely, but i didn't let it stop me. after getting on a treatment plan, and showing signs of progress, i finally enrolled in lambda school in september 2 2 . unfortunately, i learned that my first medication wasn't working 2 months in, and there was a high probability that my cml was accelerating 2 months after that, so i had to drop out, for both the possibility of a bone marrow transplant which has a year long recovery period and my mental health. i was devasted mentally for 2 months. in my head i was planning my goodbyes, i picked out a song to play at my possible funeral. after further testing, i didn't need a bmt after all. i was making progress with a new medication, leaps, and bounds of progress. it took me a while to recover mentally, but when i felt i was finally ready, i re enrolled in october 2 21 . busted my ass for 6 months, pinched every penny, and graduated from the program in may. then i hustled for months trying to get into a new job. i sent hundreds of applications and had dozens of interviews with rejection after rejection. i worked as much as a could as a grocery delivery driver to pay my bills which happened to change how they paid, so i made half as much as i did before . it has been a hard road for me these past 2 years, but i finally did it. i just accepted a job offer as a qa data analyst, which comes with a 2.5x pay bump from my previous job.",1

"for a few years, around 1997 2 1, people were really into using customized computer interfaces. why did that just go away?. for anyone who wasn't around at the time, people used to make and share all kinds of crazy ass, custom themes for their pcs. i was only aware of exactly how the process worked on windows 98 xp, but i understand that macos and linux operating systems from that era had similar support for themes. now, you might not even know what i mean by ""themes."" they were files you could download or make yourself that changed all kinds of stuff on your pc. it'd start with the colors of all your window elements, right down to different shades for the edges of the windows, the color of the taskbar, the background of the windows, the color of the scrollbar, the color of the background of the scrollbar, all the different text colors and fonts and every other little thing that could be colored. and then you got into every single different thing your mouse can do. custom mouse cursors for the regular pointer, the busy pointer, the text insert cursor, the little arrows for when you're resizing a window. they could be all types of shit. often they were insanely gaudy and ugly. and then you get into the custom sounds. everything that made a noise would be changed. and, just like the mouse cursors, that shit was also usually pretty stupid and impractical. like, you'd have a little ""ding"" sound in the standard sound set, but it'd be a whole ass line from a movie, in your custom theme. and, of course, everything would be themed around the centerpiece of the desktop background. but it didn't even end there, because 98 and xp allowed you to customize each folder with a background image. so your ""my documents"" folder could have its own background, which was applied by the theme. so, like, if you had a lamborghini theme, there might be a picture of a diablo on the desktop background, but then a countach on the my documents folder. and so on. i remember i used this one for a long time that was dragon theme. some kind of badass dark fantasy tm digital painting of a black dragon on the desktop, a weird muted brown and black color scheme, and a mouse pointer that looked like a dragon...and that bitch would start flapping its wings instead of the hourglass loading icon. and when you resized shit, the dragon would be, like, gripping the edge of the window with its claws. and the sounds were just cringe, now that i remember it. all kinds of wack ass dragon roars. but the best part was the sound it would play when windows started up from being shut down. for some dumbass reason, it was just an incredibly loud thunderclap sound. every time i was away from my computer for several days and plugged that shit back in, it would startle me to the point that i almost chipped a tooth from involuntarily jumping in my chair. shit...maybe i just explained why that shit all went away. because it was objectively lame. but it was subjectively fucking dope as fucking fuck, y'all. who else remembers using crazy ass themes? and why do you think everyone just stopped wanting to use them, to the point that nobody even complained when os makers stopped supporting them? i actually think linux mofos can still use all that crazy shit. but i ain't got the energy to fuck with linux. i mean, i've had a linux install before, but i've never gotten that far into it. but y'all discuss all this. yo, in case it's not obvious, telling us all about your favorite themes you used back in the day fits perfectly with the spirit of this thread and this subreddit i wanna hear about all y'all cringe shit ",1

"do you have any smells that you have associated with specific memories feelings?. i've been thinking a lot about how memory and sense of smell is linked and i find it very interesting that simply smelling something can completely shift my mood. sometimes the scent reminds me of something tangible like some trees in my neighborhood that remind me of 2 2 and walking with my mother and girlfriend together a lot more than we ever did but other times they give me more of a feeling or put me in a certain mood. i wonder what the most common association that people make is? perhaps the smell of rain is universal but it's not really explainable other than a vague, melancholic nostalgia for me so can we really know? another scent that gives me an inexplicable feeling is lavender. it's somewhat positive, i suppose. but i want to hear everyone's thoughts. do you have any scents strongly linked to memories or to something that you can't quite pin down? why do you think we can have such strong emotions from smells or is that just me?",1

"i'm so glad i switched to linux. it's really silly and unimportant; none of my friends care, but i want to talk about it lol : i've been wanting to switch over to linux full time since i first tried ubuntu around 14 years ago. i had made a live boot disk in order to circumvent some parental controls that my step dad had installed on my desktop. i hated the look of ubuntu back then, but everything else about it was great; even on the live disk, it seemed to run better than xp on my weak hardware? through years of school and technical jobs and everything i always remained a windows guy. and like i felt really bad about not using linux but for some reason i felt too timid to actually swap over. i guess i was worried that i'd lose a bunch of data and have to change all my applications and stuff. then, about a week ago i committed to switching to kubuntu full time, like cold turkey. i realized that most of my data is stored on cloud services and stuff, and most of my applications are cross platform, so reinstalling the os is actually no big deal at all. so i just did it. there were a few scary hiccups and i also made some embarrassingly stupid mistakes in the process. but i got everything ironed out and i can already tell it was totally worth it. there are so many reasons why i feel like kubuntu is the way to go: bash is powerful and convenient; the filesystem is tidier; it's more secure; managing software is easier; you don't have to pay for it; the list goes on. kde plasma is insanely customizable. you can have any image, video, or even shader as a background. i had an animated ps3 background with 3 simultaneous taskbars and a wikipedia widget with a 45 degree tilt? the flexibility is bonkers. you can set it to make windows translucent by mousewheeling over them. you can configure the system clock to tell you to go fuck yourself. you can have numa numa playing upside down on a permanent loop in a desktop widget not a window . just normal plasma out of the box without installing anything weird or doing anything hacky. i really wish i had been a part of the ubuntu community sooner; i should've switched way back when i was a kid. i would've had so much linux experience and knowledge by now, and i might have contributed some cool stuff. i can see this underlying philosophy that's underpinned and defined a lot of linux development. but at the same time, i guess making the transition was probably a lot harder back then. it's just that now is a great time to switch to linux. like, with steam proton, i can still play all the same games that i was playing on windows. that wasn't really the case back in the day. so maybe i wouldn't have had the patience for it back then anyway. in any case, i'm really proud to run linux now i just wish i could say that without sounding so full of myself, lol : ",1
"most genuine moment i've ever had. this happened about 1 years ago when i was a street photographer as a hobby and i clearly remember this story like it happened yesterday. i used to go around my city and just shoot everywhere for fun. but one night i came across a homeless person. now usually, i never give cash to them for obvious reasons but if they specifically ask for food, i dont mind helping. at that moment i had a banh mi, which is a vietnamese style sandwich that i grew up eating. i only wanted to bring it home with me but since he was there, i just gave it to him and we part ways. i didn't think of that situation at all but i came back to that same area browsing around with my camera and the same exact guy ran up to me and happily said, ""hey you i remember you you gave me a sandwich like a while ago "". it took me a while because that was actually 2 months ago. i couldn't believe he remembered me. i was shocked and asked how he remembered and he mentioned my camera. he eagerly asked me where i got the sandwich because he said it was legit the best sandwich he ever had. so i walked him there and had a little conversation about random things. we ended up talking for 2 minutes or so. as we approached to the sandwich shop, i asked if he wants me to buy one for him but he declined and said, ""no thanks i had nice people spare me enough money today"". i was caught off guard. he could of saved that money but declined me. it made me thought if he was even homeless in the first place. but it happened so fast that i didn't even have a chance to process. as i walked away it definitely tripped me out but that really made me happy for some reason. to this day when i walk around the area or even eating the sandwich itself, i think about that gentleman. i haven't seen him in the streets since and i go around the area every few weeks. so it made me happy that he possibly left it and started living somewhere with a roof above his head. or maybe he just wanted to relocate. who knows? but thinking about my crazy and not so perfect life, this genuine experience makes me happy every time i think about it.",1
"people treat me like shit when i wear glasses. it's strange but true. ive been told a couple of times i'm very good looking, but i've so been horribly bullied a lot growing up. i realize the difference is when i'm wearing glasses. on dates i wear glasses which i need the girl will ghost me. without glasses the girl is very u terested. it really fuckin pisses me off that people are so shallow that they allow something i need to see to justify treating me like shit.",1

"does anyone else weirdly kinda enjoy living in an apartment where the walls are thin and you can hear people just living their lives around you?. a few months ago i moved into an apartment building that's a bit less expensive than the other parts of the city, so understandably this is a really international city anyway there are lots of immigrants from all over living here. before this i had lived with an older lady who demanded silence after 9 1 o'clock and would call the cops on people throwing a party at 11 pm, so it was a breath of fresh air to be able to hear my neighbors living their lives, cleaning, turning on water, playing music occasionally, and singing with their kids. luckily there's not much wild partying or fighting that goes on, it seems like the population is mostly just wholesome families. i thought i might get tired of the noise, but since it's nothing crazy, here i am a few months later still enjoying hearing the signs of life around me. i know you people probably have tons of stories of noisy neighbors that were legitimately annoying at best, but has anyone out there been in a situation where it was actually pleasant like i am? maybe i'm just not too sensitive to noise, idk.",1

"does anyone else has this sort of soothing feeling when in a cemetery?. i mean, not sure if ""soothing"" would be the appropriate word. all i know is that walking between corridors and seeing the names, pictures and homages left on the gravestones by the families makes me feel sad but...nice ? at the same time. i begin to wonder how their lives and stories were like but also, how all of that led all of them to the same place. people so different, who lived for so many years or so littlein some cases, unfortunately and through so much and probably never even met, but here they are all together at the end of the line. most are only bones and dust by now and one day, i'll be joining them too. you'd think that that kind of thought would make someone avoid those places but even though i love my life, i still feel drawn to them.",1
"if a person calls you out for talking badly in a certain language... should you believe them?. i've had people who were overall mean to me tell me that i talk badly in their language. i thought that since they were just being mean i shouldn't necessarily believe them, but after chatting with some people online, a lot of them said things like ""if someone told you that, then it must mean something"" or ""you probably really don't speak very clearly"". and yeah, i know that what's the most important is that ""others can understand you"", but leaving that aside",1

"i feel better in my 3 s than my 2 s. my 2 s felt like i was chasing a dream. getting married, trying to get settled, securing jobs, raising kids etc etc. often exhausted, stressed, and actually felt unsettled with very little time to spare. socially i felt like i needed to really blend in with others. ironically i had little motivation to do anything other than work, sleep, and repeat and raising babies . physically i've always been a skinny guy. mentally i didn't think i was fun or attractive to be around happily married but when i said attractive, i mean i'm not someone people usually come up and talk to in casual conversations my early 3 s i realized i'm my own person and a sudden rush of motivation and drive existed that i never felt before. i ended up quitting a good paying job that was both stressful and draining. i started my own business and thought i should've done this sooner now i actually make more money, with less stress, and could do something i dreamed about doing happily with a great team. now my upper 3 s, i finally started working out because i'm way more motivated to do stuff and actually make time. important point here: i felt the drive before i had more time. physically, my body is more toned i think and i feel good about myself. i carry myself differently and even my posture changed. socially i don't try to blend in with the crowd but instead stand out not to be annoying or gain attention but to know who i am . mentally, i see myself with more confidence. now in my 3 s i feel that more random people talk to me unsolicited. i feel way more energy and desire to see and experience the world. i remember seeing a brett favre commercial awhile back for wrangler jeans and the quote was something like ""for guys who knows what it takes to get it done"". at the time i was like dude you're old. now i'm like yes that's me anyone else feel this way? i'll be in my 4 s soon and i'm actually not dreading it.",1

"will the streaming market crash?. let me start by saying i don't really use streaming services like netflix, hulu, etc. i prefer buying movies on either vhs, dvd, blu ray, or from the itunes store. and if you want my reasons, you can check out this old post of mine https: www.reddit.com r unpopularopinion comments ns9311 movietv streaming services are bs ?utm source share amp;utm medium ios app amp;utm name iossmf . but lately i got to thinking: are we on the verge of an industry collapse? just think back to the video game crash of 1983 and the dot com crash of 2 . video games and the internet were insanely popular during the early 8 's and late 9 's respectively, and this naturally led to everyone investing and trying to get a piece of the pie until it ended up collapsing in on itself. those two crashes happened due to different factors, but one key element in both instances was over saturation. and now, there's so many different streaming services to choose from that you don't know which way to look. and netflix the biggest of the bunch is starting to decline with multiple show cancellations and losing subscribers at an alarming rate. this could just be bad business decisions on their part, but a part of me wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a similar effect on other services in maybe a year or two. i'm sure streaming will survive just like video games and internet, and it'll learn from it's mistakes and adapt maybe going to just having two or three major services . then again, i could be wrong. i'm no expert on finance, marketing, or streaming, so i'm just being theoretical. what do you guys think? do you think streaming services will crash, or do you think they'll stay strong?",1

"writing your thoughts is stupidly effective to clear your mind. i've always been passionate about writing my ideas and thoughts on paper or more likely computer and i also try to write diary regularly but i guess i still haven't realized how useful writing can be for mental clarity and well being. last week was extremely burdensome for me because of so much big changes going on in my life. i was all the time stressed and anxious but the worst thing was that i couldn't even pinpoint the reason for it. at first i didn't feel like writing because i thought ""what is that going to accomplish? i'd be just ruminating even more with my worries"" but i'm glad i did. first of all i simply started to write down all my worries and i instantly noticed how it helped me to step away from my worries and see more clearly what is going on. secondly i started to naturally arrange my thoughts and problems in a better way. it was relieving to be able to name the feelings and write down the reasons behind them. eventually i felt like i understood myself better and the stress and anxiety faded away. i did this pretty much all the way through the weekend and i am just amazed how much better i feel. i feel like i can concentrate on things i enjoy and my vague anxiety is pretty much gone. i really hope this post helps someone else to relieve their stress after trying this out. lastly i want to give you few tips to make most of your writing sessions: 1. write down your worry thought or some idea related to that immediately after it occurs 2. take a look at your thought from different perspectives: reasons behind it, what it causes you to do, how could you solve the problem, is it really that big of a deal or important? etc. 3. try to arrange your thoughts and see how they connect to each other this helped me a lot . this works even better if you can visually arrange your text. 4. make a plan. it could be that you come to conclusion that your worry was insignificant or maybe you decide to change something in your actions. having a plan makes it easier for you to feel like you have control.",1

"favorite video game soundtrack?. title. not a specific song, but as a whole ""album"", which video games do you think have the best soundtrack? or perhaps not best, because that suggests objectivity. so rather, what's your favorite, say, top 5? bonus points if it's something underappreciated or less well known or talked about. you can also include a whole entire series such as mario if you enjoy all those soundtracks, or if you can't decide a particular entry from that series. mine: 1. metroid. the music in those games is really something special, the atmosphere is unparalleled and feels literally alive at times. this goes for many of the older games like metroid prime, which makes it even more impressive for the time, where video game music was less popular. 2. portal. i recently discovered the soundtrack on spotify and gave it a listen, and pretty much all the songs are bops. fast paced. they got beeps, they got boops. i feel like a collab between ""aperture science psychoacoustic laboratories"" even the name is great lol and daft punk would have been legendary. 3. hades. a fairly new game, but highly successful. surprisingly though, i never even heard of this game before, instead i discovered it through the soundtrack that i stumbled upon on spotify. best way i can describe it, is more like an acoustical version of doom. matches the fast paced greek mythological setting really well. it made me want to play the game, which i eventually bought and thoroughly enjoyed. 4. minecraft. i feel that most the music, especially the older tracks composed by c418 originally, are very underappreciated. although i don't want to call out individual songs much here, ""alpha"" is ten minutes long and thusly i think doesn't get much attention because it only plays during credits, which most people probably skip. but anyways, i believe the music perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being in a dream. 5. halo 3 odst. while i love all the halo soundtracks, halo 3 odst went for a jazzy vibe, i used to study to the ""rain"" song on repeat, otherwise known as deference for darkness. but, it also has some really upbeat songs in there for the day missions. the game in general has a far different atmosphere because you're a human rather than a spartan, and there's a mix of calming lonely night gameplay, and more epic day missions. it's one of those examples of a game where the atmosphere and music meet together harmoniously, they're almost inseparable.",1
"my time has come. after a long 1297 days, for the better or worse it finally happened. i have covid for the first time since friday. had a rough fever on friday even, saturday just a headache and tired and now just a incredibly annoying dry throat nasal cavity and sore eyes when i move em. covid caught me slacking, i thought i could dodge the bullet forever, mission failed. thankfully i have all 3 pfizer shots and they are starting to offer the 4th, covid is also treated as a flu sorta so i am allowed to go about my day if i wanted to. i d rather sleep. so how long did it take you guys to get covid? also does anyone have any useful methods to fix or at least lower this intense dry throat issue. yea ain t helping",1

"learning new things about my peers, in our final year of school.. it's our final year, so we're all busy having fun and studying for exams. lately, i've been wondering if that applies to me. i plan to be vague. i think we lead busy lives, a mixture of studies, sports, events and management activities. it's a mixture of success and failure. i want to believe that we all know each other well, but recent events are making me question that. it's really cool, finding out new things about each other as we build our friendships. but i found out about these things this late, and i don't know how to feel. it's like i finally finished building what i'd consider a nice house, then i look around me to see castles that weren't there when i started construction. i'm feeling a mixture of suprise, confusion, tension, worry and a number of other things. have i been disconnected from my surroundings? what has been happening around me? am i a good friend, or even a friend? i don't feel betrayed, just guilt i guess. for not being aware, and probably distant. seeing how others have changed socially these past few years, compared to me. it makes me worried. what can i do with my remaining time here? should i go full on studying and getting a scholarship? should i try to mend my probably wilting friendships? am i just overthinking this?",1
do you clap when a plane lands?. i haven't been on a flight in awhile so i don't know if people do this a lot anymore. i'm curious if people still do. and also curious if people clap when a plane lands just for a layover stop landing. i would guess only people who fly rarely and are scared about it would clap when the plane lands safely. do you think the pilots appreciate that or find it patronizing?,1

"alternatives to coffee, anyone?. everybody knows that coffee makes people awake, however, in my case it is not that effective. i am not used to drinking coffee even in my childhood. it's in college when i tried drinking coffee but i still get sleepy. i even tried gulping 1 glass of warm coffee to keep me awake. after several minutes i fell asleep and woke up the next day. i tried everything with coffee but it doesn't really work with me. i always fall asleep. do you have anything in mind that can help me stay awake during the night? not necessarily food drinks, but if that works for you i'll give it a try. thank you in advance : ",1
today i finally maxed out my clash royale account after 6 years and spending over 7 . started playing the game when it came out in middle school and just never stopped playing. even after the initial hype of the game died down and people around me stopped playing it i never put it down. i love the competitive nature of the game and is the only game i would consider myself to be decent at. after maxing my account i decided to add up all of the in app purchases i made and holy shit it was a lot more than i was expecting. but that s about it. 4 1 yea it was alright,1
"my best friend drunkingly called me at 1am to make sure i got home. he threw a small house party to say goodbye since he s moving 3 hours away. bummer because he s family but happy because he s evolving, known him for 9years. i had ended up leaving at midnight. as he walked me to the car, he asked me to call him when i m home and i had said he always has my location on so it s not necessary and to focus on having fun the rest of the night. i get home and immediately fell into the best post liquor sleep of my life. then at 1: am he calls me drunkenly scolding me for not calling him while also laughing that he locked himself out of his house and the cement stairs are apparently really comfortable because he can t stand up. i don t think i ve ever woken up from sleep to laugh that hard. this man was dead drunk and still remembered to check on me. it just made me reflect on the fact that there are people who care for you and if there isn t any right now, you ll meet them eventually. edit: the car an uber",1

"interesting thunderstorm experience. walked my young daughter to school this morning when we were caught in a thunderstorm with quite heavy rain. continued walking for a while until we got under a highway bridge, and as it was getting stronger decided to wait there, along with a bunch of other people waiting it out. daughter seemed a bit scared as i noticed her holding my hand more tightly, so in order to distract her told her to count the seconds and the based on the time she can work out the rough distance. just when i was about to demo it to her there was one so close that the lightning transitioned directly into the thunder we could even hear an electric sizzling sound like on a light arc for about a second during the lightning. that was quite intense and interesting, never heard the sizzling on lightning before ",1
"anyone else who has a disabled parent and how has their disability affect your life ?. hey y all , so basically as the caption reads my question is if anyone else has had a disabled parent since birth? why am i asking this question? well because my mother has been disabled since she was 1 year old, she had me when she was 27 years old. my mother suffered from a head injury which caused her to have seizures when she was a baby and be paralyzed on one side of her body, it s called a can t remember the first word hematoma. as she got older , she is not able to move her left side , and is left with blocked peripheral vision. growing up , my life was kind of harder with her because with her disability, she was not always able to understand some of the deeper meanings behind the things i needed as a child. so i always acted out and was considered the bad kid because i wanted her attention. then as i became in my teenage years things got extremely hard because all we would do is argue. now that i am older, our relationship has gotten a lot better, but besides that i d like to know others experiences on this topic i ve never met somebody else who s had a similar situation. for context behind the head injury my family claims to not really know what happened i ve heard multiple different stories such as , she fell out of her crib with the sitter , or my grandma and her were in a car crash, or they were at a picnic and she fell on some rocks, or her dad just abused her. my grandma claims it s the sitter one. but i m not sure. anyway let me know ",1
"i think i get why people overtake cars.. this happened today for context where i live there is essentially one road to get to and from work home etc. one to go in to town and one out. so i'm heading out of town in my moms cars solo whens she's in the car she's very cautious or nervous i would say even if i already have my license and everything. i was following behind this car going around 9 km h, this is fast in her books, and i would lean on the other side of the road to see if it was clear or bit cause i really wanted to overtake a car for the first time. after a while i get the chance and i go for it, just as i'm in the other lane i see a car coming so what do i do, i speed up, i'm going around 13 ish i think. i pass the car and get back in my lane, my heart was pounding, palms got a bit sweaty and adrenaline started pumping. it was ridiculously fun to overtake a car. probably won't do it again for a while and obviously quite dangerous but the endorphins it left behind is lowkey addicting. do you guys overtake often?",1

"as i get older in life, it seems as if my peers and family have grown more jaded, ignorant, and close minded. have you guys felt this exact phenomenon? esp the last few years of course.. covid certainly didn t help. but throughout the last few years it seems like everyone is really on edge. liberal left friends have turned ultra conservative. meanwhile, hardcore conservative friends have become extremely open minded. my family members have grown more divided and distant. my once cheerful cousins and family have been beaten down as they enter the workforce. but overall i ve noticed that people are much more hostile towards society. for instance, i ll ride around nyc with a friend to pick something up and we ll see kids in the city dancing or rapping, and they ll make comments like they need to go inside, read a book, instead of clogging up the roads. this generation is all about having fun and being accepting and shit i just shook my head with a smirk, but i m thinking that these kids are behaving a hell of a lot better than we did. and that guy used to be super accepting and cool. for example, growing up, we lived in a bad neighborhood with a lot of homophobia and he was one of the first kids to openly say i got no problem with gays, yall are clowns for hating on them cause they had no say in it, like us being born black . that s just 1 guy, 1 example right? no, this has been the overall sentiment i ve gotten from all types of people, from all different areas, from all walks of life. i know i sound paranoid, but i feel like facebook and twitter brainwashing has a lot to do with it.",1

"messed up but oh wow. so, basically i'm super clumsy lol . i was returning from my university with all of my classmates record notes after getting them signed, and since i was walking by myself, i was wearing my headphones on and they were on full volume. i saw my classmate in a distance and i was relieved that i could ask him to drop me off in front of my home or walk me home sharing the stack of notebooks. so in a hurry i went straight to him and started venting out at him about the professors and i was telling him that i would be really grateful if he helps me carry these books and i literally didn't let him talk until i heard, ""excuse me, i would love to help but do i know you?"" i turned to give him a slap on his back for making fun of me buttttttt to my actual realization i was talking to a complete stranger. then i came to know that i messed up by not wearing my spectacles or my lens and due to my low sense of sight i was embarrassing myself by mistaking him for my friend from a long distance and was blabbering to a completely random stranger who kinda looked like him and not even knowing it until then. but luckily the guy turned out to be a good guy and walked me home carrying all of the books and since we talked while we walked home, i later found out that we go to the same university. he was very sweet sometimes clumsy situations do lead to surprisingly good things. agree? ; ",1

"are there any tricks that help with throwing accuracy?. my grandpa used to play baseball all the time. when i was younger, he taught me a little trick to catching. it might seem obvious, but i've found that whenever i think of it before catching something it makes it a lot easier. the trick is simply ""never take your eye off the ball."" if i remember this before someone throws something to me, it helps me laser focus on the object without blinking or flinching. in turn my chances of catching are much higher. like i said, it may be obvious and i'm just dumb lol. so onto my question, are there any tips like this that could help with accuracy when you are throwing something? my mind immediately goes to the counterpart of catching, something like ""focus and don't take your eye off the target,"" but i often wonder if there are any other methods such as trying to visualize the arc of the throw. what are your thoughts on this? is there anything that helped you with throwing accuracy or is it all up to practice?",1
