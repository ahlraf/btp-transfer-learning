###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,3,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2366,304,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2366,,False,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 23, 'gid_2': 3}",,True,,1572360722.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

,depression,"After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help.

,depression,"You’re probably wondering how someone could be jealous of a depression diagnosis… well in the recent years among people of my generation mental illness has become nothing more than a quirky personality trait. Having depression doesn’t just mean being sad, but no one cares to understand that. 

I opened up to my closest friend after a lot of hesitation and I was first and foremost met with bullshit. Not a thought of empathy, nothing of that sort. Instead they said that if they had been evaluated they would have scored so much higher than me. What kind of answer is that? What has to go through a persons brain to think this is the best thing to say in a situation like this? 

Coming back to the title of the post, this person has shown many times that they want to have depression. Keep in mind, not wishing to receive a formal diagnosis for a problem that they may have, but actual desire to have a mental illness. It’s hard to express through a post, but irl their behavior makes it obvious that they think being sad sometimes = depression. And to top it off they keep making jokes calling their sadness ‘depression’ around me, just like people who say they are OCD when they are just organized.

Having depression doesn’t just mean being sad, but no one cares to understand that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up to my closest friend after a lot of hesitation and I was first and foremost met with bullshit. Not a thought of empathy, nothing of that sort. Instead they said that if they had been evaluated they would have scored so much higher than me. What kind of answer is that? What has to go through a persons brain to think this is the best thing to say in a situation like this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the title of the post, this person has shown many times that they want to have depression. Keep in mind, not wishing to receive a formal diagnosis for a problem that they may have, but actual desire to have a mental illness. It’s hard to express through a post, but irl their behavior makes it obvious that they think being sad sometimes = depression. And to top it off they keep making jokes calling their sadness ‘depression’ around me, just like people who say they are OCD when they are just organized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do people ever think before talking? I’m not even expecting empathy, but damn I’ll definitely never talk to anyone about my depression ever again&lt;/p&gt;

I am a 36-year-old unemployed male living with my 80+ year old Grandmother who still works.

Last year I lost my life savings in a long-con, my stepfather, and divorced my wife. This is not mean’t to be a sob story, just seeking advice.

**I want nothing more in my life** **but to..**

* A) Have my Grandmother live without working and to financially support her fully 
* B) Have a job (remote, but beggars can’t be choosers) 
* C) Rent my own place.

**I have...**

* I have no degree. 
* A long history of contract writing along with experience in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
* A current contract position similar to DoorDash. It's seasonal.

I am not sure how to ask for help here. I contemplated writing this due to the potential backlash but I don’t care anymore, I am just trying.

For awhile now, I’ve been unsure how to apply myself towards junior front-end development jobs or really be anybody that anybody wants. 

I’ve kept applying on and off and had two interviews within the span of 4 years. 

Two years ago I took a $10,000 bootcamp in San Francisco that assured job placement, and I’ve never felt dumber in my life. Apparently, my work was good and I have a portfolio. 

Recently, I was inspired by an old high school friend to keep applying to tech jobs and that I can do something. I have a few coding projects in the pipeline, some previous work to show, but am still piecing together the masterpieces.

**In essence...**

I am wondering if there is anybody I could talk to or have as a mentor to help place me on the right track to get a remote development job. I am willing to sign a legally binding contract that gives you a return on your investment (% of my paycheck each month for a year or more) if your help results in job placement. I am serious.

,depression,"It’s like my life has never gone up. I grew up in a moderately wealthy family, I had excellent grades across the board, smart, was good at sports and music, popular, had quite a few hobbies, and in my school they thought I was a looker too…

Now I’m 22, I’m a college dropout, unemployed, living in a cheap hostel with barely any money and estranged from my family. I’ve given up or lost interest on most of my hobbies and won’t call the few people I’m in contact with my friends. Stopped going to the gym, don’t know why I cut off my long hair, haven’t been on a date in over a year. I mean I know I can fix some of these but it’s not like when I was more fit and went to parties every week and had a part-time I was a much happier person.

I guess some of those things that I had were just illusions, but at least the illusions kept me happy. Like if I didn’t know what my parents were doing was abuse and I didn’t run away from them maybe I’d still be in school, still have money, still have relatives who act proud of me and a younger brother who looks up to me.

In high school I was one of the popular kids. I hung out with the preps, studied with the nerds, played sports with the jocks and spent the evenings playing games with the geeks. But I guess at some point I just played a shit ton of video games to escape my parents and fucked up my sleep schedule so hard, and then I still tried to maintain my dropping grades so I cut out most of my after school socializing and didn’t go to people’s birthday parties and shit anymore and now I don’t even know if the kids I used to hang out with remember that I exist.

I mean, they’ve all moved on to something better. A few of them have their own businesses with their parents’ money, some of them are doctors and programmers and bankers, a few of them rich enough to just party away and not care about college. I don’t even know if they’d want to associate with me anymore. Recently my ex from 8th grade asked a friend of mine how I was doing (I’m not on any social media) and I was gonna reach out and say hi but then I looked at myself in the mirror like a malnourished, ugly, broke dropout.

Meanwhile the new friends that I’ve made are fleeting, but I don’t know if I can complain because they’re just as self-destructive as I am and in a way I’m just lucky that it’s not caught up to me yet. I latch on to the few old friends that I still have but really we have nothing in common anymore. All these people with so many close friends that they treat as their second family and boyfriends and girlfriends that aren’t psychotic or abusive and I’m stuck in a recycle bin with all the other rejects and delinquents, but even there they think I’m too much of this way or another.

I don’t even know what I want out of my life. I’m just here wasting time until I run out of money and die I guess. I don’t know what winning is to me or what success feels like because every time I try to build towards something I become disinterested in what’s ahead in whichever path I take. To say that I peaked in high school would mean that my high school life was better than my middle school life, more accurately I peaked the day I came out of the womb and it’s been a decline ever since.

It’s not being behind that irks me, it’s the fact that once I’m behind, I’m left alone in the dust. I’ve never really wanted much out of life - some friends I trust, someone to love, a job I don’t hate, enough money to put food on the table and not be so fucking depressed all the time, but so far none of that has happened yet no matter what I do.

I spend my days not wanting to do anything, with a constant feeling of apathy and sadness from when I wake up until I go back to sleep, but this last week I'm starting to have more recurring suicidal thoughts and I really don't know what to do, I'm desperate.

I have friends I could talk to but I don't want to look dramatic or scare/worry them, I know they love me but I haven't felt that for a long time, I don't feel loved by anyone at all. I also don't think talking to them would solve anything or make me feel any better.

I'm at my limit I'm so tired of feeling like no one cares about me or that I'm never anyone's priority, always the second choice. This feeling of loneliness is killing me i can’t even describe it.

There is never anyone to congratulate me on my achievements or anyone to care for me when i can't take it anymore so what’s the point.

,depression,"This year actually started quite good for me. I found a girl that brightened up my life after years of being alone. She is mental unstable because of events in the past, but in therapy and on medication for that. The first month went perfect, we even went on vacation. It was the first time I traveled by plane in another country.
After the vacation, everything went downhill. First my car broke down, which I need for my job. After a few days of repair and an expensive bill (be aware, I just brought the trip, so I was already short on money), I got my car back and on the very day I got my car back, my girlfriend started getting more and more distant and had a mentally breakdown. After that, it first seemed everything would go better, but at one point we had a talk and she suggested a break because of her mental state and that she can't give me the attention I deserve.
I was optimistic that after short time we might get back together and she told me, she was hoping to get there too, because her feelings were still there for me.
Two weeks after our conversation, I got COVID infected and was unable to do anything for over a week. In that time, she was the loveliest and most caring person to me.
Now two weeks after I recovered, she got silent again till today where I asked her about everything and all signs are leading to a full breakup.
I just don't know to handle everything anymore. I can't eat and if I eat anything, it just comes right back.
Sleep is rare and if I sleep, I have nightmares.
At the moment I try talking to friend, try to play some of my favourite video games but everything feels like hard work and I just want to lie down and cry all the time.

I feel so distant from all my friends at school as they all do stuff without me but then act like I'm still their friend ""oh why don't you sit with us anymore"" but whenever I do they just make fun of me for being a loser.

I feel weird typing this out as I've never told anyone else about my feelings and they just think I'm weird probably. My life shouldn't even be bad but I just can't stand myself and wish I was anyone else or was at least able to hold a conversation with the people I used to enjoy spending my time with.

And I feel like this stems from how sad and bad news has seemed to filter into every aspect of my family. Everyone in my family has gone through it their entire lives. We didn’t play games and laugh at family gatherings. We sat in a circle in the living room and talked about what tragedy had happened recently. I, personally, haven’t had much happen TO me compared to the rest of my family. But I have intense anxiety and depression. My dad recently died of cancer, and my mom has been battling medical problems for as long as I can remember. And it’s all she talks about. She, and the rest of my family do this thing I call “tragedy bombing”. You walk into a room where they are or start a totally innocuous conversation and then before you know it, you’re getting a rundown of every tragic thing that has ever happened to them. Like you got a bomb dropped on you out of nowhere. For years I have listened to this, but my depression and anxiety have gotten worse and worse, and I’m at the point where I avoid walking into a room with my mom because I just can’t do it anymore. I can’t hear it anymore. I get anxious. My heartbeat picks up. I get simultaneously short of breath and sad and angry. And I usually get pulled into these tragic conversations for upwards of 30-40 minutes at a time. There is no “hey, can I talk to you?” either.

I feel like I can’t even walk to go get a glass of water without her seeking me out to talk to me about something super depressing and heavy.

I started realizing that I have lost my empathy/sympathy because of it. I can’t watch serious shows. I can’t listen to sad stuff. When my friends have something bad happen in their life, I think, “no, anything but this”, the great irony because I need a lot of support from them, but can no longer offer it.

,depression,"If you read all the way through, I really appreciate it.

What’s it even like to not have depression? How can people just go and live their lives and not feel they way I do, especially my peers? This is the only reliable place I can go to vent, unfortunately. And then I kinda just feel alone. 

I looked up for the statistics for the things I suffer with and then I realize I’m in the minority because the majority of people *don’t* feel like this. Like sure there’s “treatment,” but there’s not a cure for this stuff. I’m never not gonna feel nothing all the time. I don’t even remember what it was like to feel something other than nothing. And when I do feel “happy,” I just feel disgusted at the emotion because I know it makes me positive and idealistic. 

There’s just too much stuff I’ve been through that I don’t even know how to process, or what it even means. I don’t even know if I have trauma or not. I don’t know what’s normal or what it’s like to be normal. There’s too many uncertainties in my life. Too many things I’ve been through that I feel like the average person wouldn’t understand…

While growing up, I have been shamed for showing signs of my mental illnesses and mental health issues from people who should have helped me, such as my parents, siblings, and teachers. How was I supposed to know what was wrong with me or that I even had a problem in the first place? And now I feel I am too far gone anyways and that it is too late to get help. It’s not like therapy’s an option right now anyways…

I see everyone around me looking like adults and they wear makeup, drive cars, have a part time job. And the girls actually have boobs and curves, unlike me.

&lt;p&gt;What’s it even like to not have depression? How can people just go and live their lives and not feel they way I do, especially my peers? This is the only reliable place I can go to vent, unfortunately. And then I kinda just feel alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked up for the statistics for the things I suffer with and then I realize I’m in the minority because the majority of people &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; feel like this. Like sure there’s “treatment,” but there’s not a cure for this stuff. I’m never not gonna feel nothing all the time. I don’t even remember what it was like to feel something other than nothing. And when I do feel “happy,” I just feel disgusted at the emotion because I know it makes me positive and idealistic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just too much stuff I’ve been through that I don’t even know how to process, or what it even means. I don’t even know if I have trauma or not.

,depression,"When I was 12 my mom suddenly passed away and I lived with her my whole life and only saw my dad every other weekend and a trip in the summer. So my dad had custody since he was the father, which was ok at first but was definitely not what it seemed. Later living with him it made me realize how much of a terrible person he is, how manipulative he is, and how controlling he is. Long story short he has manipulated me into pushing the people that can help me away, doesn’t let me spend any of MY money that I saved up for and I literally just want to buy a new computer that’s all, he says he is low on money all the time but he has a 6 figure job, and is a pathological liar. 

He treats me like trash, always trying to bring me down and make everything seem like he is perfect. He will constantly say “depression doesn’t make you stupid so just work harder, and everyone has depression to a certain extent” yes depression doesn’t make you stupid but it gives you little motivation to work with, and everyone doesn’t have depression is like a constant sadness. He always tries make me feel better with a cookie from the gas station down the road, which is like a big fuck you imo like he is basically just here’s a cookie now quit it. He has made me very alert of every sound footstep I hear I’m always listening because of him.

I have been hospitalized 4 times because of him. The first time we had a meeting and was like “ ok let’s work on it” it made me really happy but then when I was discarded on the ride home he said everything I said was bullshit.

In between the first and second hospitalization during the summer while we vacationed to grandma’s and he had to leave early because of work reasons so I stayed a month before going back home and while he was home he bought a puppy from a breeder and literally picked the worst dog for our living situation, don’t get me wrong I love the dog to death and would give the world to him but he is a English springer spaniel which has tons of energy, and is now 1 years old and can barely sit down most of the time when told so, I feel so bad for the dog because he will probably never get proper training and will probably live a terrible life with my dad. But during the second hospitalization nothing too special happened except with this one quiet time rule where after every activity we had to stay in our rooms quiet for like 15-30 minutes I forget and if we were loud we would get called last if it was lunch or dinner time. So I protested against the rule so they decided to take me off my antidepressant and put me on a mood stabilizer for bipolar and other disorders, which is honestly is a big fuck you because “I’m too angry” or whatever, literally just stood in the hallway complaining about it to the staff in the hallway, nothing more nothing less.

Third hospitalization (different hospital) was honestly one of the better ones for one reason, this one staff named Stan, honestly is one of the smartest people I know who I wish I had a hotline for, he has gained my respect and I gained his. He would literally do his job for free if he didn’t have bills to pay and a family to care for. He should honestly write a book, hope we can play one more game of rummy 500 :) he made me feel like a human being because he never put himself higher than anyone else and would always treat us with respect, you should never let anyone tell you because I’m a adult and your a child, which is not a reason and if anyone says that to you it shows that they are very week minded. 7

Fourth hospitalization (same as third) was the point I stopped letting these hospitals butter me up to send me back home to dad and be all happy for a few weeks and then send me back a few months later, had a good time with Stan again.

Now here I am now in a residential and am nearing my first month, I have met my beautiful girlfriend here which was amazing because we just clicked, but she got hospitalized for almost 2 weeks now and yesterday I just had this pain wrenching feeling in my chest I’m going to die not by killing myself or anything but just a feeling I’m going to die idk why but I did.

I felt fine today but i don’t know it just felt like a panic attack I don’t know what those feel like because if it is it is my first one, and I honestly don’t know because I just been in a slightly ok mood since I’m still able to have fun time but it’s just like a weight on my back, I just don’t know what to do because I just constantly have this looming fear of dying like I could die any second when I have nothing to distract me. 

I just don’t know what to do I just feel like something and nothing at the same time idk

I had a loving &amp; supportive family who immediately got me into therapy after I said that. I've been in therapy ever since. I was diagnosed with major depression at 10. It got better for a while 12-16. I didn't feel consistently happy per se. But I had longer periods of time like I could breathe and then one day they stopped.

 I'm 25 now. These past 3 years have been particularly difficult. I cant enjoy anything.  It' so hard to get out of bed or even my apartment. I have periods where I'll spend 2 or 3 weeks without stepping foot outside. I get my groceries &amp; medication delivered, my therapies &amp; physiatrist appointments are virtual. I'm not agoraphobic. I'm just so tired. I cant maintain friendships not because of drama or anything. I'm just so fucking exhausted (mentally, emotionally,and physically. I cant keep up even in the slightest. The only person I have in my life is my mom. Which sounds pathetic. But it's true. She stops by once a week. She calls me every couple days to make sure I haven't killed myself.

But here's the thing: I'm not sitting around moping. I want to get better. I want to get better more than anything.

I've even done TMS and ECT therapy but nothing works. 

I'm still trying.... because I really want it to work. Right now I attend 2 support groups, one is for people with Dysthymia that meets weekly over zoom. The other is a major depression group that meets every other week. I do AA meetings (I've been sober 5 years) weekly. I go to therapy 2x a week and I see my psychiatrist monthly. I also maintain a healthy diet and exercise. *(to the best of my ability. The crippling lethargy that comes with depression makes it near impossible to do regularly)* That's been my treatment team/plan for about two years. I know it's not working.

,depression,"Is it normal to lose the ability to feel emotions in your body?

Posted something similar days ago, but have found a picture to show what i am experiencing, or more accurately not experiencing. 

Before i used to have really strong and intense physical responses to my emotions, and i would Feel them deeply. 

Now i dont Feel anythfing in my body. Not even the warmth of contentment and relaxation. Only stuck in neutral. 

Also dont Feel tired when working out! (This one is so strange), and never sink back into my chair. I never get that nice heavy feeling in my body. Still just neutral. 

This has happened over the last few weeks! 

I can cry, but I dont feel any emotion in my body when I do. My chest does not tighten and I cant feel the sadness like that. My chest just feels empty and hollow. I try to feel, but it still just empty in my body.

I also dont feel touch like before, I am not numb, but I dont get tingles or good feelings in my body with touch or hugs. I dont get warm feelings in my chest and stomach. Still just empty. 

I feel like there is no connection at all between my brain and body, so the body does not generate an emotional response.

Sometimes I can feel sad in my brain/mind if that makes sense, but then I cant feel any emotions in my body at all. It is so strange. Sometimes all that happens is i get this muscle contracrion in my chest and back, but no pressure or other sensations. 

I cant react in an angry manner with voice changes and body language, but on the insade i still cannot Feel that surge of rage.

Anyone else dont feel any emotions in their body? Can this get better?

,depression,"This is long but please read I am so mentally destroyed because of my therapist. 

Today's session left me feeling worthless &amp; than I was a failure and I didn't expect it from my therapist who I had so much trust in. 

I was talking to my therapist about being lonely. It's something I've struggled with &amp; have brought up the her before (this time though had a specific trigger). After that I told her some classes I'm planning on taking to help myself get out more (which she had told me to do) and I was looking forward to taking these classes. (Pottery, Martial Arts, Painting, etc)

It went downhill when I said the classes have to wait a few weeks due to an injury to my arm that won't allow me to participate. They have flexible start times, so the wait is only a few weeks. 

All of a sudden she started blaming me for feeling lonely because I was putting off these classes. I stressed to her again that it was beyond my control due to my injury but that wasn't enough. 

She then went on to blame me about changing my mind on college. Awhile back I mentioned thinking about it but due to many personal reasons that she has previously heard &amp; claimed to understand that college isn't possible this year due also partly to things beyond my control. 

I explained to her that I want to take things slow. I've had several personal tragedies this year (that she knows about) and even if I wanted college right now I'm in no mental shape to deal with that on top of my full-time job. I'm also thinking I'd perfer vocational school instead of college.

I want to take these next few months and put my life back together. I want to take life a day at a time, I want to get back to things I enjoy. I want to clean my house because it's become a mess in my depression. I want to get out and meet new people, I want to take casual classes with things that interest me without all the deadlines &amp; stress. I want to go hiking on my days off again. I want to start training again for a 5k when my arm heals…. 

After months of stress, of worry, and running around having to deal with every new life altering problem. I don't want to jump into a classes that I don't even want to take. I want to find myself again. 

She didn't understand that, she said I'm wrong &amp; that I need to go to college no matter how hard it is &amp; how expensive it is and that's the only way I'll succeed in life…

I left my session today is tears. It's been 7 hours since my session and I can't stop crying. I feel so hurt by the person I trusted wouldn't hurt me. I feel betrayed, I feel lost, I no longer have the support because she was my support. I don't know how to move past this.

,depression,"Hello! I (M) started a new job recently (~couple of months) and pretty early on I got along great with a coworker (F). We would spend a lot of time at work together since we were a great team even though our job roles don't usually permit teamwork.

I have had depression for 13+ years and have worked on it for the last 8 years with therapy/meds. I was very stable before I joined this job. I have never experienced Anxiety symptoms in my life. I never get afraid of anything, to be honest. When you are on death's door and death doesn't scare you nothing can really scare you anymore. At least that was my thinking prior to this.

She and I talked deeply about issues we have, where I told her I have depression and am medicated. Usually, I would never share this with a coworker but she made me very comfortable somehow.

Eventually, my feelings for this coworker developed over weeks, and I felt some kind of anxiety developing in me. I was afraid of disappointing her professionally and/or privately. I would go out of my way to work immensely to help her out. I would work in my free time to help her out. Every time I got to work I would have this feeling of immense stomach pain, like butterflies but x100. My hands are shaking, I am short of breath and honestly, I can't really describe it. I have never experienced something like this before. I would have these panic attacks every time I would face her. If she was in a bad mood I would take it personally and would feel sick to my core.

Eventually, I had a depressive episode/breakdown in front of her, I was honestly close to jumping out the window that day. I wasn't that close for years. Since then I have been just a mess emotionally. I feel so ashamed and broken. She is very supportive and actually kind of a great person considering the circumstances.

Nonetheless, I am afraid of my anxiety around her or WHY I feel this way. I don't want to feel this attached/needy of anybody. Before I joined this job I was very independent. I am single and very happy about it in fact.

If anyone can give me tips on how to deal with this anxiety PLEASE tell me.

I will try to talk to my therapist and change meds ASAP. I changed meds recently and never felt this low with prior ones.

Should I distance myself from her?

Should I just straight up quit?

Should I take a long vacation?

,depression,"I hate that I have resorted to posting on Reddit, but I have noone around who understands me. My life seems so shitty, but I don't know how to fix it. People on the outside looking in might think that I have it made, but they do not see the struggle behind the ""success."" I (in my opinion) have to fight harder than anyone around me to achieve anything. Case in point, I recently quit teaching after 5 years (fucking hated all 5 years) in hopes of getting into Tech. After countless applications in the last three months, I have only received about 5 interviews, two of which I made it to the final interviews. They strung me along for an entire month, and still did not hire me. I have a master's degree and so many tansferable skills, but clearly I am not good enough. I cry so much because I am tired of struggling mentally.  Although I have a supportive mate (and a small savings) I do not want to depend on her. There is nothing like having my own.

People on the outside looking in might think that I have it made, but they do not see the struggle behind the &amp;quot;success.&amp;quot; I (in my opinion) have to fight harder than anyone around me to achieve anything. Case in point, I recently quit teaching after 5 years (fucking hated all 5 years) in hopes of getting into Tech. After countless applications in the last three months, I have only received about 5 interviews, two of which I made it to the final interviews. They strung me along for an entire month, and still did not hire me. I have a master&amp;#39;s degree and so many tansferable skills, but clearly I am not good enough. I cry so much because I am tired of struggling mentally.  Although I have a supportive mate (and a small savings) I do not want to depend on her. There is nothing like having my own.

,depression,"So I live in the Caribbean as a queer 24 yr old male and it has not been fun.

For a while, things are fine, meh, neutral and there is not much pressure so things are slow. I try to take advantage of these moments. But sometimes, I get into a spiral and at this point they are valid and they come from a real place.

For a while now I have been feeling so much envy and frustration of being born in an environment where I can not express myself safetly or freely. Not at homes, not with friends or school.

My whole world is in my head and my living life is just this waiting game. I have never been in a relationship, I have never experienced intimacy and I really want to but I can not.

I can blame this country all I want, I can self hate, envy ... that wont change anything right?

So I try to work on myself so that I can be useful eventually, but I feel I have been doing this since my teens.

Since my teens I have been seeking a way out of this country but because of my mental health, I can not be as explosive or creative, useful or impressive. I don't have friends hat help me play, jsut an annoying family situation where I feel stuck and disgusted.

I don't want to live anymore but that is not an option. It won't fix or improve anything just create more pain so what am I?

I am so tired... I fear I will never get a chance nless I pull something off but to expect so much from myself out of fear and desperation is maybe why I am still sick.

,depression,"It all started going downhill friday the 17th of december 2021, when i got caught buying 2gs of weed at a park at night and a fucking cunt of a police man who wasnt on parole decided to ""work"" all of a sudden. Im italian, here is illegal to buy weed and the police is obsessed with it. I study medicine, im not a degenerate and spending time chasing weed smokers is a fucking waste of time, but thats how it is here (oldest population in the world). Medical cannabis is avalible BUT only 1 place in italy produces it, so it costs 800€ per month to people with sla, alzheimer, parkinson, chronic pain ecc... a violent fucking system. I was an activist for the legalization of this substance, but the old people in the justice system couldnt give a fuck about 1 million signatures.
They took my id and now every time the police stops me they search for drugs on me.
I had a girlfriend at the time. She helped me a little at the beggining of the year, but my depression grow bigger and bigger, i just wanted to die this winter. Ive had many abusive friends, my gf wasnt better. In the 2.5 years we were together i helped her getting out of depression and was ALWAYS avalible for her when she had insomnia. Her ex boyfriend was 28 when she was 15. She never admitted to be a victim of a pedophile and every time a therapist told her so she just changed therapist and started all over again. No cbt, just untrustworthy psycoanalyst. She had been super possessive over me and drowned me in her loneliness. She was never a sociable person so she could float in that post-covid situation, but i couldnt. I spent every, EVERY fucking night with her. I really loved her because she was my little precious person, i gave my everything to her. She gave me back nothing when i needed it. No love, no comprehension, no affection, every time i showed my depression she got upset, like she just wanted me to help her and didnt want someone with problems because she already had many. Man i felt like a turd. My gf, the person i loved so much, i gave my all to, just wouldnt help me. Couple of months later she dumped me like the biggest piece of trash. I still remember the look of disgust she had towards me just for having a major depressive episode. How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even put any effort in helping me back. 
 I lost all my erasmus friends with covid (they went back to their country) and i live far away from home. I couldnt make any new ones because of my gf and how passive i was in the relationship(we lived in the same campus, basically together). I also spent 26 days in isolation in a remote hotel-covid with no internet, shitty food and cockroachers, because i caught the virus and the campus couldnt handle me apparantly. I understood how fucking dehumanizing prison is.
When she dumped me, i started cbt but became addicted with benzodyazepines, though i started taking ssri so I could get out of bed, finally. The problem is that i became totally apathetic, i started fighting outside clubs to feel something. Never i had done such things. Its like all the hidden aggression caused by previos trauma was the only thing i could feel. Got in many troubles.
I also couldnt study properly, so i didnt really perform at exams but luckily i still managed to keep following a lazy,
 but better than nothing schedule.
This summer i met many people and i thought that finally therapy was working, but man young people here are so untrustworthy, everyvone i swear tried to use me for money or as a fuel for their narcisisim. Only a few were decent enough to have a proper nice simple open conversation. The mysanthropism that i try my best to repress is one of the worst thing i have experienced.
Now i will go back to my campus, lonely, with tons of work to do, addictions, insomnia, a broken heart, uncertainty for the future due to war and inflation and climate change, stress and anxiety.
I know there is a lot worse (and this just makes me more depressed) but i just cant solve this question: why live?

,depression,"This is my first post in reddit and sorry english aint my first language. I was diagnosed with bipolar hypomania or mixed episodes like a year ago after being misdiagnosed with social anxiety and major deppression for five years. I didnt even know what bipolar was until I had a roomate that had that condition but I never even was aware if I was having high or lows. I was unaware for a while until I had a nervous breakdown a year ago and decided to go to three psychiatrists that diagnosed me as bipolar and I started taking depakote. 

In terms of relationships ive never had a girlfriend, only one time and it was long distance and it lasted a month because we both had numerous issues. Ive had a lot of casual sex with numerous partners mostly in my manic times and done numerous drugs and had risky behaviour, I just realized ive been doing this a year ago. 

So, to get to the point, Ive been trying to stop my medication and stop seeing my psychiatrist  , I know is a bad idea, three months ago which is around the same time I met this girl. When I met her through a friend We went to my place and nothing happened but then saw her two weeks later and hooked up, things started going really fast as it usually does and we were spending weekends together and going out on dates. I started getting needy and clingy and professing my “love” for her which she didnt correspond as she was coming out a relationship and she just wanted to hang out. So all this and the fact that I was reducing my meds was bringing up minor manic episodes at times when I would become paranoid and jealous and start pushing her away as I always do. I broke up with her the first time cause I thought we would better be friends, the I called her an hour later for her to come over. The second time was because she arrived late and then she was anxious so we made up. Third time was because I started to feel more attached and feared that I might lose her. And now the fourth time this weekend because I thought she was with some other guy which it should be cool because we only dating but I keep feeling that everyone out there is there to get me.

I went to her house with flowers and chocolates even though she blocked me and explained to her that im bipolar and although its not a excuse I like her a lot and sometimes is out of my control and I dont mean it, that I want her in my life and that I really love being with her. She said she us not a tennis ball to keep bouncing on the wal and that she is really hurt and felt like I will keep doing this all the time and she was crying and very upset with me which I understand. She said she might think it over the weekend to see if she takes me back

I honestly think she would be better off without me as Im a complete mess and I think things just might get worse, although I realized many bipolar relationships, the bipolar person is always pushing the other person away. I dont wanna keep doing this, especially not witth this girl, but she says that now she is going to be scared of anything that she says or does because I might dump her and that she will not be able to be herself. I really dont want her to feel that way, i want her to be free and not locked down on my emotional mess. I have to let her go but part of me still cares a lot about her, I just dont want to make her cry ever again or hurt her. I feel like a jerk for playing with her feelings. 

I know dropping my meds is a really bad idea but I miss my old self and wanna have a heathy relationship but im even scared of myself as im usually self centered and unaware.

,depression,"Before I start/for context: I’m not asking for any professional advice. I suffer from mental health issues myself (BPD, re-occurring depression, anxiety, ADHD) and I’ve been in treatment for a decade- so I’ve been around the block. Im just looking for different ways I can help my partner- more ideas.

So I’ve been with my partner for 5 years. We both have mental health issues and we have VERY different communication styles and are experience depression differently. My therapist doesn’t want me to do couples therapy until I do a year of DBT.

He’s in the process of finding the right treatment. I know I have to be patient, but it’s so hard- I’m in DBT myself and it’s hard when my expectations are different then reality..

He has poor communication, 0 energy, and he’s sad all the time and it’s starting to impact our relationship because I NEED communication. I need quality time, but his way of showing love for me is by providing for me- so it’s different than what I want. He’s not the affectionate type and he tries but I guess it’s not enough? Idk.

I try to be there for him, and anytime I try to talk to him about our relationship he shuts down. I show him what I’m learning on communication, but he doesn’t do it.

 Does anyone have any advice on how I can be there for him? My BPD has definitely caused issues but I’m showing improvement. I’ve asked him how I can help
 and he tells me there’s basically nothing I can do. I have depressive episodes and I know what I need during those times- but he doesn’t.

I suffer from mental health issues myself (BPD, re-occurring depression, anxiety, ADHD) and I’ve been in treatment for a decade- so I’ve been around the block. Im just looking for different ways I can help my partner- more ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been with my partner for 5 years. We both have mental health issues and we have VERY different communication styles and are experience depression differently. My therapist doesn’t want me to do couples therapy until I do a year of DBT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s in the process of finding the right treatment. I know I have to be patient, but it’s so hard- I’m in DBT myself and it’s hard when my expectations are different then reality..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has poor communication, 0 energy, and he’s sad all the time and it’s starting to impact our relationship because I NEED communication. I need quality time, but his way of showing love for me is by providing for me- so it’s different than what I want. He’s not the affectionate type and he tries but I guess it’s not enough? Idk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to be there for him, and anytime I try to talk to him about our relationship he shuts down. I show him what I’m learning on communication, but he doesn’t do it. At this point, I just feel like it’s his problem and I can’t do a damn thing.

,depression,"Based on the posts I’ve seen here I think that this sub might be the best place for an introvert like me to fully open and release himself. Sincere thanks to everyone who will manage to read my whole post.

I’m a 24-year old man from a Middle-eastern Europe. Since I live in Central Europe, the viewpoints, cultures and lifestyles here are very divided - some people I know are of neoliberal democratic viewpoint (pro-Biden/Clinton, anti-Trump/Putin,etc.) and other ones (mostly people from theirs 40s onwards) share social democratic patriotic viewpoint (anti-Biden/Clinton, pro-Trump/Putin,etc.) ... This division is seen as well among my family and friends. My father is a fundamental baptist fatalist - he says that this world is one big political machinery and an ultimate satanic deception, he expects Jesus’s second arrival soon to destroy this planet by fire for good. Sometimes he tells me very clearly that he wants to die and “be finally with the Lord.” My mum easily falls for conspiracy theories, refuses us to get covid vaccinated, reads alternative media and facebook posts for whole day, etc... What am I? A big mess simply said.. From the age of 16 to 21 my father raised me as a baptist as well. I was a sincere believer in Jesus Christ, I was sharing the gospel to my friends and even classmates at the university believing I might be saving them from “eternal damnation” (if they decided to believe). In order to become a good follower of Christ I studied bible, theology and history in my leisure time and at the age of 18 I signed up for studying history at the university believing it would strengthen my faith even more. Well, the opposite became the truth. I realized my whole perception of history was fairytailed. The biggest milestones were learning about the evolution, prehistory and the political aspect of dissemination of christian religion which was often done by violence (Charlemagne’s conquests, Teutonic crusades in the Baltic, Spanish inquisition, recatholization,etc.)... By the time I started learning more about evolution and biblical contradictions in my spare time and then I finally deconverted in 2020. In hopes of achieving freedom from religious limitations, only then I realized I’m lost.

Since my brain had been used to elaborate every life concept from baptist perspective for 5 years, the remnants of my past faith are still present in my mind until today. I try to consider every aspect of life with a critical and rational unbiased mind to come to the most objective and right conclusions. However it is very hard because there is still an irrational side of my brain that wants to evaluate things emotionally by christian ethics and that is how I got to know what is anxiety, the worst feeling you can possibly experience. When rational thinking collides with my past biblical opinions and interpretations, that’s when it hits. And I have these collisions everyday at every topic possible, whether it’s science, history, morals, enviroment, vaccines, etc... I realized I needed a professional help so I was attending a psychiatrist for a year. He prescribed me antidepressants encouraging me that these medicaments would make me feel relieved and in a few months these mental struggles would be over. First half a year I took Escitil and the second half I took Alventa. Even though they are supposedly “strong” antidepps, they didn’t help me at all. That’s why, after a year of treatment and spending big money I decided to seize using his services and currently am very skeptical about pharmacy industry overall.

How does my life look like now? = recurring mental struggles; I hate my father because due to his brainwashing I lost 5 years of my life devoted to delusion and especially my teen years which are essential on brain development during the adolescence period; experiencing trauma when thinking about my christian past; masturbating on daily basis because that’s the only natural thing that gives me relief and inner peace which I so desperately seek; and lastly I’m completely lost. I don’t want to fall into any religious BS or hyper conspiracy theories anymore, but as a critical observer I have to say this world just doesn’t seem to operate naturally for me.. There is a propaganda in the US and in Europe as well, including my country. There is a certain concrete viewpoint our governments want us to hold on topics like Covid, Ukraine, Russia, refugee crisis, multiculturalism, entertainment industry which is rigidly pushed by the mainstream mass media. It’s a political agenda or at least, that’s my opinion. We’re living in the age of information and with so many contradictory knowledge and opinions going from all sides, it is no wonder some people choose to follow alternative media or conspiracy theories.. Are we living in a natural world or a matrix? It is because I’ve studied the arguments of both sides that I’m lost... What is the truth? Do you believe there is an absolute truth and is worth to devote our lives to it? Is the concept of absolute truth dangerous because it produces fanatics as my dad is and I was?... You know, I guess it doesn’t even matter, in the end, we all share a common destiny, the death. The only thing that makes our lives different is how our life paths will shape towards this irreversible destiny. Some people experience a joyful life, some experience a sorrowful life.

studies, i was an overachiever, I had big dreams and
goals. But I couldn&amp;#39;t score my desired marks in 10th
grade coz I got addicted to social media and it made
me feel like a failure. I felt ashamed and decided to
go to the farthest college from my school i felt like I
was dissociated the whole time all my decisions felt
impulsive. And as expected I did terrible there coz i
kept felt lost, the teacher there hated me, i felt
ashamed of what I had become. I couldn&amp;#39;t study
properly i kept thinking about going back in time
and wishing to do things differently back then. My
class teacher called me a failure, my father called
me a loser. I have no confidence left. This is not
where I wanted to be in my live, I feel so helpless. I
even toke a gap year and I feel like a burden, i
couldn&amp;#39;t study properly, it&amp;#39;s so hard to concentrate
on studies, i have lost interest in things that I used
to enjoy. I&amp;#39;ve been having thoughts about s€lfh@rm

I just started working and am really worried about the job as I don’t want to lose it. Any tips for ensuring that I continue working well. 
I am a paralegal so focus and attention to detail are necessary. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

So the actual story: A bit over a month ago I found a kitten with no mom, no siblings. He was all alone and in rough shape. I took him in and I've been taking care if him ever since. Originally he was supposed to be a foster. I've taken him to the vet and he's on his way to being fully vaccinated and soon to be fixed too.

Unfortunately for me this means I've kind of abandoned my own well being? Taking care of this kitten has take  everything out of me. All my free time is dedicated to him since he needs to play with someone since he's all alone. He needs to be taken care of since he's only a baby and I don't resent him for that. I can't, it's not his fault. But I am exhausted. My sleeping schedule has been altered since I've had him. Again, my free time is dedicated to him and when I'm not home I'm thinking about how to better take care of him. I have abandoned all the hobbies I used to ground myself because I can't do them with him around since he always wants to be with me/interrupting anything I'm doing. I've considered finding him a home right after he is fixed since I know this isn't sustainable for me mental health wise but my dad says no one is gonna want him if he's too old. My mom wants me to keep him because she likes him but I'm the only one who takes care of him. I'm the one who has to be with him all the time. I know his kitten behavior isn't forever and he's actually a really good cat but I'm at my wits end. I'm always angry, always sad, always feeling bitter and miserable after I started getting better. Like I keep crying out for help but only receive ""but he's so cute and such a good cat, hang in there"". I'm also concerned that if I do give him out for adoption, there's no guarantee that whoever adopts him has his best interest at mind and doesn't take proper care of him, mistreats him or even abandons him.

&lt;p&gt;My college has been saying they will get in contact to see if I can go back to college and do a course but it&amp;#39;s almost the next term so I doubt I&amp;#39;ll get in what makes me feel so stuck and empty like I have nothing to do and it&amp;#39;s overwhelming I feel so useless and not achieving anything is turning me insane it&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t know what I want to do but I&amp;#39;ll do anything than just consume media and smoke all day and talk to guys as some validation&lt;/p&gt;

I have a steady job, actual furniture, a closet full of clothes, lots of hobby supplies, plans to travel, and now I might possibly lose it all.

I relapsed self-harming after not doing it for 3 years. I mentioned it to a friend who also has battled with his own mental health problems. And he told me he's starting to resent me for being so negative and making him feel bad when there's nothing he can do to help. (He used to call me his best friend. He owns his own home with multiple empty rooms. He could literally keep me off the streets if he wanted to.) 

I would feel a lot better if there was one person I could rely on. I have friends in another country who tell me all the time that they love me and I'd never have to worry about being without a home, if only I was born there instead of here. And I appreciate them so much, but that also makes me feel bad because I DO live here. And here I'm alone.

I’m closing in on 40, I’m massively overweight (280), bald, have very few friends, don’t see or talk to my family as often as I’d like, have a few grand in the bank and need periodic help from my father to keep up with the cost of living. I gave up chasing my dream job because I’m lazy and didn’t want to put in the grind to get where I wanted to go. I have no life insurance, no stocks, no 401K, no savings.

I married an alcoholic and compulsive liar, who ended up making life a drunken hell, went to rehab, and started sleeping with someone she met there. She brought this man into our marital bed every chance she got, even after I found out, and that only stopped because she was going to be kicked out of the house by the courts and him not being on the property was a condition of her staying in the house. Since then, she’s left every single weekend to go off and be with this other man while I’ve been left at home to take care of our five year old daughter and wait for the divorce process to play out. She leaves before I get home on Friday and walks in on Sunday like it’s the most normal thing in the world. 

At work, I smile through the day, but all I hear are stories about everyone’s families - husbands, children, people going on maternity leave - and think about how that’s all been ripped away from me. No one is telling cute stories about me or things I did for them or the family. There are no siblings for my daughter to learn and experience life with. I’m all she’s got, sad to say. I feel terrible for her for getting dealt such a lousy hand.

At night, either me or my “wife” puts our daughter to bed. If she does it she stays upstairs and goes to sleep. If I do it, she goes to bed herself before I finish.

,depression,"So, I met this girl (24) I’m 27yr old Male on Tinder. Really cool girl. 
Went on a couple of dates. She was very keen and very interested in me.

On our third date she wanted to make plans to go on vacation with me in November.

On the 2nd month. She revealed that she has depression, attempted suicide when she was young and was on medication.

Kept an open mind, proceeded to see each other every weekend. For 3 months.

4/5th month decided we needed to spend time with friends so only saw each other 2/3 weekends.

We went on vacation together in two different countries for two weeks.

But, when we got back from said vacation. She expressed that her depression was getting worse (Due to a sudden crisis and fear of her future).

Only seen her once on after vacation, for a date which she almost blew me off.

I tried not to take it personally and I’ve been there for her. Gave her some space whilst checking in.

Texts were cold. Only spoke to me out of convenience. A full 180.

Then had a mini breaking point where I asked to go on a city break next week since it’s been 3 weeks since we spent a weekend. 

I expressed that quality time is important to me and it would be nice to spend some time.

She then goes “I don’t want a relationship or anything tbh. So I don’t think we should talk anymore.”

Even though we were just planning a trip to an island on November and October. Like, last week.

I then said “okay, I understand”. “I want to be here and I don’t want to give up” and “I wish we could talk”.

She then says “I’m stressed so please leave me be.”

In which I replied, “I’m sorry I’m making you feel this way, whenever you wanna talk about things, I’m just here.”

The End. 

I care about this girl a lot and I love her and I’ve been reading around. It’s not like she didn’t love me either. I don’t want it give and I want to fight the best way possible.

Any tips out there guys. I’m backing off for now until she ever reaches out to me. 

Tbh, I have been very financially supportive since our time together and have had amazing experiences. But, I believe that has also been a bad thing.

,depression,"
So, it's been a while since my depressed state has been growing but these days is turning hell. 

Due to summer, I am in home until september I begin again college so I spend most of the day alone only with my thoughts, so  memories came into my mind and make me feel sick, angry and extremely sad and depressed.

,depression,"(M,20) I don’t even know how to start typing this. I don’t know how to begin explaining the way I feel. I honestly do not think I should be here on the internet complaining about my life but I just don't have anyone to talk to about this right now. The only guy I would even think to try to open up to about all this is currently hammered out of his mind, and I love that for him, he deserves to blow off the steam, but tonight my mind is just everywhere and nowhere and shutting itself down all at once and I just need to get it out somewhere that isn't just my head because it is killing me.

For starters, I suppose I am worthless. I am not particularly good at anything. I am not good in conversation. Despite my efforts, I often find that I am inconsiderate and often times it is a result of my own stupidity lack of awareness. I can't make people laugh like I used to. I feel like all my friends look at me differently these days. I feel like my social skills have regressed across the board, as I can barely converse with my co workers (ive been working this job for close to 7 months), I enjoy eating nothing, I can barely convince myself to go to the gym anymore, and the list goes on but my god. I just dont know. I feel foolish for crying sometimes. If my family knew, if my friends knew... I feel like a failure. I feel as though I've just allowed myself to become a piece of shit and I am genuinely afraid because no matter how loud I scream at myself to turn the lights on again, I just can't do it. I feel lonely and I just cant find joy in so many things anymore. My favorite songs dont fire me up anymore, I usually can't even sit through them in their entirety now. Ive gone to therapy before and taken anti depressant medication before as well, and I cant afford to pay for one without the help of my parents, who do not know the way I truly feel. I love them and I feel horrible for not being honest with them about it, but I just cant compromise the remaining façade that im doing better these days. 

I cant count how many times ive tried to kick myself and get back on the wagon, but i just cant hold on. I am scared that I wont break the cycle. I know there are hundreds of thousands of people who dont. I hate myself for allowing this to happen, and at the same time I no longer have the passion or energy to hate anything. I can feel my opinions on any given subject turning from whatever firm position they were to nothing, to carelessness. I feel as though I am the worst type of person, not a protagonist, not an antagonist, not even a side character or a fucking extra in a movie. I feel like the lone viewer of a movie no one gave a fuck about, and yet I can't will myself to leave the theater already. 

It is times like this when I think back to better times, before I was even aware of the social constructs that and responsibilities that bog me down now, and those memories don't even feel like they're from my lifetime. At best it feels as though I watched it happen to someone else, or perhaps that it was one of those good dreams you try all day to remember better.

,depression,"I am a 21 year old male and been on SSRIs for 8 weeks now. I'm very unsure if the meds are actually working, and I don't even know how they are supposed to work. I will try to compare different things associated with depression before taking the meds and now.

**Sleep**

Before:

* Some nights I could not sleep at all. Other nights I slept around 3-4 hours.

After:

* I sleep a little bit better now. I fall asleep easier, and i sleep around 6-8 hours. However I don't feel rested when I wake up, which make me think that the sleep I get is low quality.

**Energy**

Before:

* Very low energy. Could not get started studying for my exams. Many hours of the day used in bed.

After:

* I still don't feel like I have enough energy. I do however function on a kind of autopilot that takes me out of bed in the morning and keeps me going through the day. But my energy is still low and not normal levels.

**Depressive thoughts**

Before:

* Feelings of hopefulessness. Constantly thinking that nobody likes me, and that will always be the case. Thinking that I will always be alone, and that this way of life is not worth it. Feeling like I lost myself and I will never find myself again. Hating myself. Feeling that absolutely everyone is better than me, and that people are better off without me.

After:

* No changes here. I still have these thoughts. However a little less frequently, and when I do have these thoughts, I feel like there are so much thoughs in my brain that I don't have the energy or time to explore them all right now.

**Low episodes and self harm**

Before:

* Some very low episodes where I lost some of my control. Wanted the thoughts to go away and feel something different. Self harmed to accomplish this. Sometimes excessive use of alcohol to keep away from self harm.

After:

* The first 3 weeks of using ssri I experienced these low episodes more frequently. After 5 weeks I have not experienced this anymore. However when I experienced these lows I was alone and could do whatever I wanted to. Now I'm surrounded by family because im on vacation, and I cannot let my family know that I'm depressed. So I do not have the same opportunities to experience these lows. The fact that i also don't have the time or energy to explore my depressive thoughts make these low episodes less likely. I think that if I were alone right now, I might still get these low episodes with self harm.

**Isolating**

Before:

* Isolated from other people because I feel like the worst version of myself, and I don't want to be a burden for people. Also felt like I have nothing to contribute with. Not funny and didn't contribute to conversations.

After:

* No change. Still isolating for the same reasons.

**Loss of interest in hobbies**

Before:

* Not enjoying my hobbies. Not getting the joy I used to get from doing things.

After:

* No change.

**Summary**

I'm unsure if the SSRIs are working for me because I still feel depressed. My depressive thoughts are still there, my energy is still low. I sleep a little bit better, but the sleep I get is low quality. I still isolate myself from others, and my hobbies don't give me energy or joy. I have not self harmed in 3 weeks though. This might be because of the antidepressives, but it might also just be because that I am on vacation and spend time with my family which keeps me occupied from depressive thoughts. But the thoughst are still there, and if I were alone I think I would have enough time to explore my depressive thoughts and expereince low episodes of self harm.",t2_e3hocd1p,False,,0,False,How do I know if my SSRIs are working?,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_wgqmli,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1659690661.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 21 year old male and been on SSRIs for 8 weeks now. I&amp;#39;m very unsure if the meds are actually working, and I don&amp;#39;t even know how they are supposed to work. I will try to compare different things associated with depression before taking the meds and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some nights I could not sleep at all. Other nights I slept around 3-4 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sleep a little bit better now. I fall asleep easier, and i sleep around 6-8 hours. However I don&amp;#39;t feel rested when I wake up, which make me think that the sleep I get is low quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very low energy. Could not get started studying for my exams. Many hours of the day used in bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t feel like I have enough energy. I do however function on a kind of autopilot that takes me out of bed in the morning and keeps me going through the day. But my energy is still low and not normal levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depressive thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feelings of hopefulessness. Constantly thinking that nobody likes me, and that will always be the case. Thinking that I will always be alone, and that this way of life is not worth it. Feeling like I lost myself and I will never find myself again. Hating myself. Feeling that absolutely everyone is better than me, and that people are better off without me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No changes here. I still have these thoughts. However a little less frequently, and when I do have these thoughts, I feel like there are so much thoughs in my brain that I don&amp;#39;t have the energy or time to explore them all right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low episodes and self harm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some very low episodes where I lost some of my control. Wanted the thoughts to go away and feel something different. Self harmed to accomplish this. Sometimes excessive use of alcohol to keep away from self harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first 3 weeks of using ssri I experienced these low episodes more frequently. After 5 weeks I have not experienced this anymore. However when I experienced these lows I was alone and could do whatever I wanted to. Now I&amp;#39;m surrounded by family because im on vacation, and I cannot let my family know that I&amp;#39;m depressed. So I do not have the same opportunities to experience these lows. The fact that i also don&amp;#39;t have the time or energy to explore my depressive thoughts make these low episodes less likely. I think that if I were alone right now, I might still get these low episodes with self harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolated from other people because I feel like the worst version of myself, and I don&amp;#39;t want to be a burden for people. Also felt like I have nothing to contribute with. Not funny and didn&amp;#39;t contribute to conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No change. Still isolating for the same reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of interest in hobbies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enjoying my hobbies. Not getting the joy I used to get from doing things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At this point I find myself alone and not wanting to carry on like everything is normal. Again, I am not sad, I’m not mad, I am just done! Who says suicide has to be looked at negatively? Over the years I have had friends that have taken their own lives, and kind of a sick way I was always jealous of their success. I understood more than most how it felt to just be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m posting this as a cry for help, I think I’m posting it so that others may see that what they are thinking isn’t all that abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read my post.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I came to the realization that some people were born lucky and some unlucky, and that life is simply not fair. Hang on with me for this one.

All my life, I went through trauma after trauma. From my parents' emotional abuse of my siblings and me or simply my dad abusing my mom in every kind of way possible, to shitty relationships with friends, romantic partners, and family.

I want to talk about a specific story.

About a year ago, my younger cousin did something to me that I will never forget nor forgive. I always knew she and her family weren't good people, they always seemed mischievous and mean in my opinion but what can I say, it's ""family"" and my dad cares about his sister and her kids a lot, even though they are terrible people. So I was forced to stay in contact with them. As I was visiting family, her mother and she made a plan to put me in deep trouble. We had a sleepover and she must've seen me put my password into my phone, and while I was sleeping she went through it without my permission. She took screenshots of almost every single thing from private conversations to pictures, even the most private, and sent them to my family. All my family hated me (they never liked my mom and my siblings in the first place, for allegedly ""stealing"" my dad so I guess it was just a way to create trouble between me and my dad). Anyways I resent them today and they never apologized to me, mind you this was a year ago. They never got any punishments or sanctions whether it was from my dad who never took my side, from this stupid universe, or from God.

Why am I saying all this? I've always expressed my dreams to my family, especially a particular job that is still today my dream job. Guess what? She got that job. She got it so easily, through parents and connections probably since she's still young and inexperienced. She's the happiest person alive even though she's evil. I've worked so hard, and never got anything.

The point is, I have many stories like this, whether it's an ""ex-fling"" who lied to me and hurt me badly by lying that he was single. I did what I thought was right by telling his girlfriend. Guess what? they're still together today. He got to go back to his calm life while I was completely and still is broken by this situation. Whether it's friendship, abusive relationships, bullying when I was younger, etc. People who did me wrong got nothing back whatsoever, which is probably one of the reasons why I do not believe in karma. I would like to note that everyone told me that ""I don't know what's going on behind doors, maybe they're unhappy"" please spare me this speech. I am not victimizing myself, nor just seeing ""the negative"", as surprising as it may sound, I've always been full of hope and the one to see the positive in every situation. 

I used to be very religious, until recently. I just couldn't do it anymore. I've always felt like God wasn't seeing me and abandoned me in a way. So what's the point of praying and hoping for the best when it simply just never comes?

I'd like to mention that I've always been a positive person, very ambitious and determined, but I can only do this for so long... I ask every night what I did to deserve this. I can't help but wonder what is then the purpose of life, religion, karma.

Please do not bullshit me by saying that it gets better, it doesn't. I've been saying that it gets better for the past 6 years. It doesn't. I try every day, I work hard, and I try to be a good person but life keeps shitting on me. It's bullshit after bullshit and I never get a break.

,depression,"I used to think if I worked hard to achieve success then it would make all the suffering of depression and anxiety worth it. 

In high school I got good grades. I took AP calc/physics/chem etc, 4.0 gpa, 1490 sat, all that jazz. I thought hard work = success.

In college I realized that my understanding of hard work is naive. it doesn’t just mean getting good grades, it means being courageous, networking, and having charisma. I decided to work on myself, go to the gym every day, read self help books, work on social skills, and meditate. I spent countless hours researching diet to optimize my health. I restrict my daily diet to only the most nutritious foods because I want to feel and look good. It all makes an incremental improvement to my depression.

I’m 21 and now I realize that hard work is necessary but not sufficient for success. It also requires luck. If I weren’t so hyper focused on the end goal of success then I may have had a chance at realizing and capitalizing on the lucky opportunities that were presented to me. 

I’m alone every day and I have no career path other than a useless degree in business. 

People laugh at my business degree as if I’m stupid. I had scholarships to many schools including top ranked STEM schools. I chose business because I’m a strategic thinker with a broad set of skills that could enable me build more efficient systems from the top level. I got a minor in computer science so I can stay on the cutting edge of tech because i view programming and ML as an invaluable tool in business. However comp sci is not my passion in life so it isn’t an option career.  

No business or employer gives a shit about any of that. They don’t want someone to make their business more efficient , they want someone to follow the instructions and meet the status quo. I want change the status quo. 

they care about who I know and who I’m friends with and which frat bro at the company will give me a reference. Nepotism with extra steps.

My depression feels overwhelming right now and I'm not sure what to do for it.

So here’s my story and some of what I feel. Some days I don’t want to get out of bed, I’m starting to hate some of the things I’ve loved since as long as I can remember. I think I got depression at around 11 or 12. When I moved out of my old neighborhood and switched schools so I was away from most of my friends. All I remember from the moving process is a lot of crying, living in a basement with my mom and at the time former step dad who was a functioning alcoholic. They recently divorced at the time but still lived together he didn’t leave until I was 15 but they married when I was 8. Then when I was 13,  I started having a very short temper, often having fits and breaking things and running away from home trying to go back to my neighborhood to see my friends, even though I returned to my old school things changed, I realized nobody there cared about me much and all I had to keep me happy was video games which my mom and school threatened to take away my Xbox. When I was 14, in summer school I started a joke, and I became popular and things were doing so well, I was on the road to recovery and then it all fell apart, I became a huge target for bullying, nobody thought I was funny anymore, and I left after 8th grade. Then my grandfather, who was one of my main father figures and my best friend died. When I was 15 I made a desperate attempt to save my life long dream, but by 16 my mom killed it. Then my uncle who was my other father figure died. At that same time I was being bullied and harassed constantly online.

I asked my mom why she would do that and she said everyone has depression and we all “get over it.” All they’ll do is make you take pills that do nothing for you, and that we choose to be depressed so I should quit bitching. I have trouble conversating with new people because I don’t trust them, I don’t shower very often or brush my teeth and she sort of makes fun of me by telling me I smell. I’m almost 18 and she doesn’t want to help me get a drivers license. I look in the mirror and just want to punch myself. I have more friends online then I do irl.

,depression,"I am gonna share my life bc I have nothing better to do right now. So my (16f) first tragic moment I remember is when my two-year-old brother died when I was almost 5. He died in an accident. At that age, I wasn't really aware of what death was but still, I remember being sad and crying a lot. I still feel sad when I remember our moments together. 

Then later in my life, I got bullied in school when I was around 9-10 years old for literally no reason(I was protecting myself from that assholes but yeah I still got bullied). Then later through middle school, I had some problems with my relationship with friends but nothing important still friends with them. 

Then when I was 13 I and my family moved to another country where I didn't know the language(I still live there). It was pretty hard to leave everything behind. And that is when things got shitty. 

So it was the middle of the school semester of 7th grade. Shortly I was ripping my ass off to learn the language but bc of it was so hard I was learning slow and basically, I wasn't understanding anything and couldn't speak (It is like being deaf and not being able to speak, yeah I was hearing but not understanding). It was so hard to communicate, I was so lonely. Every fucking day I was watching everyone laugh at each other and spend time with each other. I was so lonely, lessons were hard and it was whole another culture. It was the worst time of my life. I had no one to talk to. My parents were asking me how I was doing but I kept telling them lies to don't make them sad. So it was like that for about 2 years. 

Then I started high school which was 2 years ago I taught things would get better but no I was wrong. That was when my depression started. Even though I was better at speaking the language I was learning, it was still not enough and I was having communication problems(Which I still do from time to time) and still kinda lonely at high school as well. I met with new people last year (no in the school) but I feel like they don't actually like me that much. They rarely invite me to hang out with them. 

So yeah also for the last year I am constantly thinking about dying. I am not brave enough to kill myself but I would like to die in an accident or maybe in my sleep it would be so peaceful I think. 

I think my biggest problem is I can't get over what happened in the past. Nothing brings me joy in life. I constantly feel sad and alone sometimes completely numb. 

That was it I guess.

When I had a therapist (I did a better help trial) they said I’m not one because I asked if I was and “narcissists wouldn’t be as self aware.” 🤷🏽‍♀️ as for my family, at the very least they have a god complex. They’ve always made me feel bad about myself. I usually see the rest of my family every 2 years fir holidays but we’re all distant a lot of them don’t think the best of me because of my parents. It’s hard to give a real insight to my struggles with all the story gaps. 

Anyway I could go into detail about it all but I’m already getting carried away. I struggle with rejection/paranoia and I’m certain I have anxiety and depression. I’ve struggled with not making any new meaningful connections for 5+ years now. I’ve become so impulsive and am in credit debt. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was young so I think it had a lot to do with their development. If I didn’t have my partner idk what my life would’ve ended up like today. Over the past year we both addressed our addiction to weed. I’m gonna try and hold myself accountable to not smoking anymore with hopes of getting a real job this fall. Goal is not going back to it  for at least 30 days! My partner has their own set of mental struggles but I think  isn’t as bad as I in some ways Luckily they’ve h grown up with 99% of their friends. I tried blending into their circle but it’s gotten hard to ignore their judgment they see me as a spoiled kid I think. I’m just there as a rag along and it’s hard to ignore their remakes and talking to my partner  in the past about it made me feel paranoid and afraid to make matters worse by confrontation. But that just makes breaking points like it has 
I look to YT for most of my free time or end up sleeping most of the day when I’m alone. Seeing other ideal relationships makes me hope that someday I this will be in the past. It’s gotten worse this summer since I’m out of college for the first time in like 7 years . I hide in my room a lot which I hate but I really appreciate it too. His year I made progress in some ways like taking to a few acquaintances in work vs my last job where a bunch of kids used to bully me. I used to cry  on and off just thinking about how my life has turned out but now I feel stuck in my ways like it’s safe, guarded, cold at times, I lost social skills, and at times I’m unbothered by it.

,depression,"And it hit me from a really good friend sending me an old photo.

I went back on our ‘see friendship’ thing on Facebook to find photos to send her and I found myself automatically smiling. We met 10+ years ago (when I was 19) and we were so present in each other’s lives up until around the pandemic time.

Life felt more carefree (partially due to age I suppose), we would joke about stupid stuff way more and we had so much time to be present for one another.

I was so happy at university compared to now (even though I still had some mental health problems). I’ve realised more recently that it’s because I had a sense of community. I lived with my friends and had a rich, consistent social life with people I grew so close to (because we were so present for one another most days).

I’ve felt so incredibly empty and depressed recently. 

The more real adult life progressed, the more friends became busy with career, family and partner commitments. I ended up relying on my partner way too much and when I left him 6 months ago, I’ve been left with an empty feeling ever since.

I’m trying to learn to enjoy my own company and it’s definitely getting a bit easier and I appreciate myself so much more. But I long so desperately for that sense of community I once had. Texting friends about more mundane stuff and then meeting up every 2-4 weeks is so unfulfilling. Virtual/online connection does hardly anything for me. We are still good friends, but that connected, truly comfortable feeling has faded… the kind of feeling you get from true community. We’re all too focused on what modern society tells you/requires you to be focused on to truly connect. I’m almost 30 so it’s getting even worse due to people wanting/trying for children.

Community is so important and I really do think it’s a huge contributor to why so many people are horribly depressed nowadays. Even when I think back to the 90s/2000s, people seemed more connected… even the adults in my life with one another. I feel really fortunate to have grown up for part of my childhood without the kind of intense social media/technological landscape we have now.

I am SO thirsty to be part of something. To have purpose… to create… to learn and experience something with others. To have real HUMAN, normal bonds… not whatever this post-pandemic weirdness is. It’s so unhealthy.

Community is out there, but I think we have to search harder and fight much more for it. You have to really put yourself out there and join some kind of club, cause or group. The kind of pre-set communities like neighbourhoods, churches etc. just don’t exist in the same way anymore.

We’re so damn individualistic… and I’m tired. The more I sit in my home office working and only having proper contact with my housemates most days, the more I feel my empathy and ‘humanness’ depleting. No more… I’m getting myself out there even if it requires joining 5 damn clubs and going bankrupt in the process.

&lt;p&gt;I went back on our ‘see friendship’ thing on Facebook to find photos to send her and I found myself automatically smiling. We met 10+ years ago (when I was 19) and we were so present in each other’s lives up until around the pandemic time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life felt more carefree (partially due to age I suppose), we would joke about stupid stuff way more and we had so much time to be present for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so happy at university compared to now (even though I still had some mental health problems). I’ve realised more recently that it’s because I had a sense of community. I lived with my friends and had a rich, consistent social life with people I grew so close to (because we were so present for one another most days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt so incredibly empty and depressed recently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more real adult life progressed, the more friends became busy with career, family and partner commitments. I ended up relying on my partner way too much and when I left him 6 months ago, I’ve been left with an empty feeling ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to learn to enjoy my own company and it’s definitely getting a bit easier and I appreciate myself so much more. But I long so desperately for that sense of community I once had.

If life is that video game where you don't the have motivation to play or you feel totally disinterested, don't feel like collecting the easter eggs, the collectibles, building and working your way up or hate the story mode so much you can't stand it then don't be fucking forced to play, turn the console off and quit. Because when you quit there's always something next. 

Given free will, given the ability to quit, if free will is acceptable in this realm then quitting is too. 

I love and value myself god damn I am a great ass human I am amazing I am great. But I will not be great to you or amazing to you or others because I don't fucking want to be.

,depression,"The reasons why I've decided to end it:

1. No matter what plans I make, I never execute them.

2. Because I can't share it with someone else.

3. I have zero friends.

4. I'm still living at home.

5. I need attention. Some attention. Just *something*. But I'm just a random dude walking by, a nobody.

After years of trying, and after years of reading self-help books, I know it's not going to be better for me.

I gave it a fair chance. After 10 years of still not having my act together, I see no other way than end it.

I have to. I can't keep on living the same day every time.

""Rob a bank."" Yeah, I know. I know. Just *do something different* right? I know. But my mind already knows that it doesn't matter. All of the things I might do differently or improve: it does not matter.

I helped others. I *lived for* others. Doesn't help. After a while, they take it for granted. And you become a doormat, a pushover, a friendly guy.

I hate my life. I've seen enough.

I'm not going to kill myself right away, but *am* going to do so in a couple of days.

I seriously hope that someone out there has the solution. Something that gives me hope.

But man, I am so completely done of this useless, boring existence.

""Just get a job, do X, do that, etc!"" Yes I know. Easier said than done, as always. If I could, I'd already fly to Hollywood and ask some celeb to marry me, I mean come on, life doesn't work like that.

Anyway...

Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

**Edit:**

First of all THANK YOU ALL for your comments. It means a lot and I'm overwhelmed by it. I'm trying to reply to as many of you as I possibly can. If you don't get a reply, know however that I've read it and that I appreciate you taking the time out of your day/night to write. Again, it's much appreciated.

Digital communication can be cold, but I have to stress that I'm not saying 'k thanks y'all I'm cured now bye!' What I do want to say, again, that I absolutely appreciate your words of wisdom, encouragement and hope. It feels good to know that I'm not completely alone.

,depression,"I'm going through a divorce. We have kids and I have an awful on call work schedule. She's fighting me because she wants me to get them only on the weekends. It kills me because I miss them. Everything was amicable. I cheated years ago. Then she decided to cheat and keep cheating 5 years later. I threw in the towel. We decided on divorce. I started to date months later and she flipped out. Using the kids against me is all she has. I've been in therapy and met an amazing woman. Now I'm struggling with her. We've both been through bad relationships. But after therapy I stopped holding everything in... Now it feels like a mistake. I use to close off in arguments and try to keep the peace. I found someone I could be honest with and it's great. But I find that when I share too much I almost just want to tell myself stop talking too much. Now I feel like I'm falling into my old habits and want to keep quiet. My mother has been gone for 20yrs. My Dad never had a relationship with me. My one Aunt has stage 4 cancer.

nowadays my daily schedule is to wake up at around 1-2pm, sigh, use my phone to order food delivery for lunch, stay in bed until the food comes then have lunch. afterwards i would take a shower, sit at my table and watch youtube until it's 6.30pm. time to order food for dinner. i watch shows until i finish dinner, shower again, watch more shows and go to bed on facetime with my bf at about 1am. i would then mute myself and go on tiktok while he sleeps, until i'm able to fall asleep at (usually) about 4am. 

why is everything so tiring? literally from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep, i'm dreading everything in between and more. i'm worried about the future - my upcoming semester, my finances, my relationship, my parents, etc. i told my boyfriend all this earlier and he doesn't seem to understand my point of view. i know he is desparate in trying to be in my shoes, but i'm not sure how to explain it to him. i told him that to me, staying alive is like a bothersome chore that i don't like to do, but it's necessary. his reply to that is ""just think - if you die, i'll be all alone in this world."" and that makes me cry my heart out. 

as i'm writing this post, i've stopped bawling and i think i'm thinking logically. i'm depressed and i have been depressed for a really long time, and honestly it feels like life is not worth living anymore. yes i love my boyfriend with all my heart and i would hate to leave him with all the trauma. but i'm feeling too much pain and emptiness every day, and it makes me feel helpless.

,depression,"title gets it good, used to have friends but I learned recently that they haven't actually liked me for a solid year and its been a façade on their part, the general stuff like constantly talking shit behind your back the moment they think you're out of earshot, avoiding me, the whole meme about the second group chat with everyone but me has been my reality for Lord knows how long, only time they ever contact me or don't reject my attempts at making plans is when they need something from me, whether its playing IT support or chauffeur its the only time they want me around. Had a girlfriend but ended up pushing her away by not being the most healthy mentally so I guess I have nobody to blame but myself on that front, she deserves better anyway. I have parents I could talk to in theory but last time they found out how badly I want to die most days they cried and I love my parents so I'm not putting them through that again. I have no idea what to do with my life now that I'm nearly out of highschool, I don't even know what my options in life are, I don't know what I don't know.

Is feeling more outright Anger a sign of becoming less depressed? 

Like is that a sign of being less numb and sad? 

Anger is a separate emotion from those things, a more extroverted one that makes you speak out and things as well as can make you feel a strange sensation in your throat and stomach similar to butterflies.

I don’t like being Angry because it causes me to be rude towards people and possibly hurt their feelings and I hate that I’ve been doing that recently but I’m just curious if it’s a sign of lifting depression, like is it a good thing or a bad thing?

I’m working on stopping myself from blurting out things or shooting people dirty looks because it’s so mean feeling but I’m hopeful it’s a possible sign that I’m becoming less depressed, I would really like if someone could answer this

,depression,"TW: Discussion of attempt

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to be empathetic and help someone I care about very much. I just don't understand. Hoping someone had a name for this or had experience with it or something - I'm lost!

I understand being depressed and desperately wanting to get better - I can also understand being depressed and feeling completely hopeless and helpless - I can understand feeling like you deserve to be depressed - but I cannot understand what my person is going through - they WANT to be miserable and depressed?? They do not have the exhaustion you get from depression - they are making the conscious choice to not exercise, eat decent meals, etc.

And when we try to help them they go on these long tangents about complicated math/psychology/philosophy/science which I think is an attempt to prove that they are smarter than us. They will also curse at us and tell us to not contact them. They are mean and treat us really badly. During a visit before things got this bad they told me literally that ""being unhappy makes them happy"" and that they ""want to be unhappy"". They are in the hospital now after an attempt... our worst nightmare that we wait on edge for every day to get that call... It was obvious to everyone who saw how they set up this attempt that it was done deliberately so that they would survive, that someone would find them in time, and details were given on how to save them were written out. So it looks like it was done to get attention? Like a cry for help?  But at the same time when you try to help them it's like they will do everything possible to not let you help them. And I mean - if they truly wanted to be miserable why would they attempt? They had exactly what they said they wanted?

I want to be clear that we are trying our best to be patient, kind, and to understand them - we don't tell them what they should do and instead have been trying to ask questions to figure out what the core issue is to get them help that will actually help. But all of these attempts have failed. They just go on and on about socrates and the calculus of the universe or something. Or are so cruel and tell us we're stupid.

,depression,"My excuses beforehand as this may be a long post. Hi, I'm a guy and I'm 23 years old. My life has been a constant battle with myself and the world around me.

At a very young age, I have been diagnosed with Autism. In general, me and the people around me feel like it doesn't really affect me, which I came to doubt. I also have been bullied for most of my life. One of my only friends in person was my nephew living across the street. Even him I now barely see as we grew apart once adult life started and schedules stopped aligning.
From the age of 10, I been diagnosed and struggling with depression. I tried to get through it, but on my 14th I broke and tried to do something stupid, but I couldn't. In that time I was on a high school specifically for autistic people, and via there I got into a mental hospital for treatment. After that one, I went to a second. I been away from home for nearly 2 years for that, and it didnt help. Eventually I learned to help myself, and once I finished high school and started college at thw age of 17, I felt better. College was decent, and even though I struggled through those years and had an amazing persom there to guide me, I still felt lost.

I ended up working in the restaurant business, something I somewhat enjoyed. Then Covid hit. I lost my job, I lost my passion, I lost my girlfriend of 3 years (which ended up being good for me, as it was not a good relationship). 

For the past 2 years, I have been lost. I tried dating, but always felt alone or lost. I couldnt get a proper job and even though I made some online friends in the progress, still I feel alone. I discovered I have Aphantasia and a whole array of mental and physical issues.

Now to my current situation, as Im sitting here overthinking life. The more I type this message, the heavier I feel. My hands feel like bricks hammering at my phone. I feel like I am lost again. I feel like I am scared again. I feel alone and afraid and I do not know what to do. I have a job I enjoy, but due to the current economics it kind of got very silent temporarily. I stand up, go to work, come back, all I want to do is sleep. I pull myself out of bed to eat and force myself to keep doing stuff. I have hobbies I do, as I play DnD on 3 week days. But where I enjoyed this in the beginning, I cannot concentrate on it anymore. I have some online friends and people I am very close with, but it feels like its one sided, wether its true or not. I feel alone and I feel like I bother everyone.
I frequently overthink and overreact, and freak out. I started getting ptsd flashbacks of terrible things and I just shut down. Im already searching for a psychologist, but the waiting lists are extremely long. 

I don't know what more to say. I have trouble feeling and thinking. I only keep going because work is counting on me to show up. Everything outside of works feels like a lot of effort to me, and dare I say, I would be better off alone and not having any obligations to do or see or talk to anyone. But I know I couldnt, and shouldnt. Currently, there is one specisl person in my life. She makes me happy still, whenever she texts me I get happy. Creepy or not, I sometimes look at her photo's because her face and her eyes and her smile makes me smile. But those are the only moments I feel like I enjoy. In fact, those are one of the few rare moments in my life I actually feel emotions. Normally emotions have been a state of mind, a though. I just 'know' I feel something rather then feeling it (I may be a sociopath). But Im afraid to scare her away or lose her, and Im scared to get hurt. Most people in my life have hurt me and I know she is different, but my minds tells me to be scared.

I don't know what to do, where to go, or what I need. I get through life now by spending money on stupid shit I dont even need or use. It doesnt even make me happy when I buy stuff. I just dont want to have money, and I cant be happy, so I prefer making others happy with it. I have no idea where Im going with this post, just a look inside my mind.

,depression,"Uni - failed;
Looks - ugly;
Tried - so hard and lost it all :’)


Yesterday I took all my items from my dorm room back to my parents place. I see no more future for myself. 


Im also struggling so hard with eating disorders. Two months of not eating, two months of stuffing my face.


I feel like a robot and people treat me like it. Just worked in a warehouse for some money to support myself and I didnt make any friends there. Managers used me to do a lot of work because I was a “good worker” who never complained and did what has been told.

,depression,"Preface (its long but thanks for reading):

These past few months I've been feeling pretty drained emotionally and mentally. I've felt depressed for a long time now but it's really hitting hard now. My childhood pet that I loved like my firstborn child (and the only one who understood me really) passed away and someone I was really close to at work passed away recently. I'm still at home with my parents and siblings working so I can't really afford to talk to a counselor or move out yet and I don't really trust anyone in my family to talk about my problems either.

My mom would just tell me she has problems too and turn the conversation into being about her/venting or saying she's too busy to deal with my issues. My dad works all day and comes home late at night so when I do talk to him I have to do it in a hurry and sometimes I say forget it because I know he's stressed enough and I don't want to add to it. My younger sis is like my mom in some ways, she will listen to me but then when I start talking about my depression the answer is to pray it away and then she talks about her own problems bc she's looking for advice. My bro is in his own world and won't even say hello or ask me how I'm doing when he sees me. And my other bro, who I haven't really spent any time with since elementary school, will only really greet me and talk to my parents and other siblings when he comes around for visits. We have a estranged relationship that I've given up on building a long time ago so I don't think I'll ever feel comfortable sharing anything with him. If I talk to another family member, especially about my mom or family issues, they'll take what I said and spread it as gossip or go back and tell my parents. When I tried telling my pcp about my issues (with my mom in the room), she could only watch in horror as I admitted that I was feeling overly stressed and depressed (something I never admitted to a doctor before but I've dealt with almost my whole life) and then explained to the doctor for me that I'm only feeling that way because I lost my pet and my co worker this year and wouldn't let me elaborate any further because she didn't want the doctor to ""put me on any medication"".

My bff spends most of her time now hanging out with her girlfriend's friends and partying. I always had to initiate calls or hangouts which didn't even feel like quality time together because she was always messaging someone else or not really listening to anything I say. I'm a INFJ so that really hurts to deal with since I'm always there when she needs me for anything and willing to give emotional support too.

Out of everyone in my social circle, she was the only one I could rely on but I didn't do it often because I didn't want to be dependent on her. I used to talk about my problems with her but with her being busy with other people, I haven't really had anyone to vent to or express how I feel (which is hard enough already). I've felt this way before a few years ago and  when I told her I wanted to spend quality time with just her and no one else, I thought she understood what I meant since we haven't had this issue since recently. I was already feeling pretty depressed but when I saw how low of a priority I was on her list to even care about what I have to say, I completely shut down and haven't said anything to her or any of my other not as close friends for over a month because of how hurt I felt.

She asked me if I wanted to celebrate my birthday last month and because of how stressed I am with work, school, and other business I told her that while I appreciated the thought, I didn't want to celebrate this year. I just didn't feel like hanging out while I still felt like this and had these kind of thoughts because I know I'd cover it up the best I could and be ""happy"" so the mood won't be sour. Plus, the death of my pet has really been hard for me to get over and this was the first birthday I experienced without her so it's not really a happy time for me right now.

Tl;dr: I guess you can say I just got tired of feeling like I have to explain how I feel to them when they ask what's wrong with me or if they did something because what's the point if no one is even going to listen or try to help me. Or they hear me out and then get defensive when I say they are a part of the problem. I'm always expected to be there for everyone no matter the situation or how I'm feeling and yet when I need help, I don't really have anyone to turn to which really isn't helping my depression so I've completely shutdown on everyone.

So I guess I just wanted to ask if there was anything I should do? I do plan on paying to see a therapist in the next few months when I start working again but ig I just wanted to know if it was okay to feel burned out after all of this.",t2_qxbw1vmm,False,,0,False,Feeling Emotionally Burned Out and Don't Know What to Do With Myself?,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_wg7h69,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1659635171.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preface (its long but thanks for reading):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom would just tell me she has problems too and turn the conversation into being about her/venting or saying she&amp;#39;s too busy to deal with my issues. My dad works all day and comes home late at night so when I do talk to him I have to do it in a hurry and sometimes I say forget it because I know he&amp;#39;s stressed enough and I don&amp;#39;t want to add to it. My younger sis is like my mom in some ways, she will listen to me but then when I start talking about my depression the answer is to pray it away and then she talks about her own problems bc she&amp;#39;s looking for advice. My bro is in his own world and won&amp;#39;t even say hello or ask me how I&amp;#39;m doing when he sees me. And my other bro, who I haven&amp;#39;t really spent any time with since elementary school, will only really greet me and talk to my parents and other siblings when he comes around for visits. We have a estranged relationship that I&amp;#39;ve given up on building a long time ago so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever feel comfortable sharing anything with him. If I talk to another family member, especially about my mom or family issues, they&amp;#39;ll take what I said and spread it as gossip or go back and tell my parents. When I tried telling my pcp about my issues (with my mom in the room), she could only watch in horror as I admitted that I was feeling overly stressed and depressed (something I never admitted to a doctor before but I&amp;#39;ve dealt with almost my whole life) and then explained to the doctor for me that I&amp;#39;m only feeling that way because I lost my pet and my co worker this year and wouldn&amp;#39;t let me elaborate any further because she didn&amp;#39;t want the doctor to &amp;quot;put me on any medication&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bff spends most of her time now hanging out with her girlfriend&amp;#39;s friends and partying. I always had to initiate calls or hangouts which didn&amp;#39;t even feel like quality time together because she was always messaging someone else or not really listening to anything I say. I&amp;#39;m a INFJ so that really hurts to deal with since I&amp;#39;m always there when she needs me for anything and willing to give emotional support too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of everyone in my social circle, she was the only one I could rely on but I didn&amp;#39;t do it often because I didn&amp;#39;t want to be dependent on her. I used to talk about my problems with her but with her being busy with other people, I haven&amp;#39;t really had anyone to vent to or express how I feel (which is hard enough already). I&amp;#39;ve felt this way before a few years ago and  when I told her I wanted to spend quality time with just her and no one else, I thought she understood what I meant since we haven&amp;#39;t had this issue since recently. I was already feeling pretty depressed but when I saw how low of a priority I was on her list to even care about what I have to say, I completely shut down and haven&amp;#39;t said anything to her or any of my other not as close friends for over a month because of how hurt I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asked me if I wanted to celebrate my birthday last month and because of how stressed I am with work, school, and other business I told her that while I appreciated the thought, I didn&amp;#39;t want to celebrate this year. I just didn&amp;#39;t feel like hanging out while I still felt like this and had these kind of thoughts because I know I&amp;#39;d cover it up the best I could and be &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; so the mood won&amp;#39;t be sour. Plus, the death of my pet has really been hard for me to get over and this was the first birthday I experienced without her so it&amp;#39;s not really a happy time for me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: I guess you can say I just got tired of feeling like I have to explain how I feel to them when they ask what&amp;#39;s wrong with me or if they did something because what&amp;#39;s the point if no one is even going to listen or try to help me. Or they hear me out and then get defensive when I say they are a part of the problem. I&amp;#39;m always expected to be there for everyone no matter the situation or how I&amp;#39;m feeling and yet when I need help, I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone to turn to which really isn&amp;#39;t helping my depression so I&amp;#39;ve completely shutdown on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I just wanted to ask if there was anything I should do? I do plan on paying to see a therapist in the next few months when I start working again but ig I just wanted to know if it was okay to feel burned out after all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey Reddit. This is my last resort to just talking about anything. It’s been a long week. 

For clarification I have been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and PTSD. the past 6 years, and have been struggling for almost 12. I am in therapy every Wednesday.

I have become nothing but an empty husk. I’ve began to take 3-4x more of my antidepressants just to barely keep my head above the water. (900-1200mg , 300mg is my dosage.) It does ok. I have already tried 7 times with my psychiatrist to help me but he doesn’t seem worried about anything I tell him and dismisses me with no change to my treatment.

I have no friends. I have tried talking to people who I think are my friends but then I’m told I’m a p•ssy for going to therapy.

I have had probably the toughest week of the year. My girlfriend broke up with me then I had my car repossessed yesterday morning which takes my last ounce of any freedom I had before.

My family doesn’t seem to care about anything I go through. My parents co-signed on my car knowing full well I couldn’t just buy a car from a dealer alone, which of course resorted to repossession. I am now actively looking for a loan to maybe just pay the car off and make payments to the bank on the loan? I don’t know shit about anything. No one has ever helped me learn how to be a functioning adult, almost 22 and I feel like I’m a joke. I don’t know what to do or how to do anything.

I have already had my father get in my face and yell at me about how do I have PTSD if I have never been to war or had a gun shot at me, I am constantly degraded and mistreated. I cannot move out because of my credit being shit and of course with how this stupid ass country is doing I can’t afford to do anything. Let alone if I stay in this town any longer I might just die.

I’ve just been sitting here, doing nothing, all by myself. No support, no friends. My only friends I feel like I do have are my bearded dragons. But obviously they don’t know what I am talking about but I guess it makes me feel better I can at least talk to another living thing without being told I am wrong or should just take my own life.

I have 2 “friends” from way back when I was in middle school but they don’t ever seem like they care enough. They just resume their conversations without me while I just sit here and get consumed by extremely depressive thoughts.

My now ex and I broke it off mutually. We knew we were mentally not doing so good and that we would still talk to and support each other because down the line it’s possible we could try again because we don’t hate each other and are still very open about wanting to be there for each other even if there is no label in the way.

But I feel embarrassed to try and talk to her because obviously this isn’t only about me and I want to help her too. I’ve become super isolated, I don’t want to eat, drink, or see anyone. So I just lay in my bed staring at the wall for hours until I pass out again.

,depression,"My spouse battles with depression and anxiety on a near constant basis. I try my best to support her in every way she needs (closeness when needed, space when needed, offloading tasks from her todo list, etc)....but there's a pattern that quite frankly is becoming exhausting and overwhelming: she takes her pain out on me verbally and emotionally.

Sometimes she later apologies, sometimes she doesn't, but honestly I don't care about the apologies, I just want there to be less to apologize for.

,depression,"Sorry for the long text 


I feel like im stuck. Everyday feels the same. I can't enjoy anything anymore. 
Idk how to explain this but i feel like life is just passing by and that my body is doing all those things but im not. I feel like life goes too fast, one second i wake up and the next its night again. I have memories of doing things during the day but it feels blurry and distant. 

I felt like this a lot when i was in 3rd-4th of ESO (14-15yrs old), it started around quarantine, and last year i changed schools and made friends, had people who helped me, i felt more alive and real like it was me who was living this life. 

But now that its summer and i can't go to school Iv'e gone back to this. I don't enjoy life. Its scary. Im not my body. Everything is just a loop. Life goes by too fast and im not able to come back. Its like im not relly controlling it. I feel like its just in auto pilot and im not the one who is living. Im just a mind. But this is not my body nor my life.


I also feel like kinda trapped in dayreaming, im always doing it, there is always someone talking to me, i know its not real, its just a dream, but I can't get out of it.


I hate the idea of sleeping. I feel like i loose more control than ever. My body just decides to sleep whenever it wants to and im scared of never woking up. Of never being able to come back like ive done this year when i was with people i felt accepted and loved. 


I don't know why i feel like this, I have autism, depression and anxiety (tho im not diagnosed with the last two) Im also trans, everyone at school knows, and now that im back home i feel like im someone else, not really me.
Part of this is probably that I don't like my body, and probably why i feel disconnected from it. 


But its scary, i just want my life back, i want to live again, to be myself again and enjoy life, but I can't come back, theres some kind of barrier between my brain and my body and im not me.

,depression,"I'm 29 years old, working fulltime and I live at home with my parents.

I have no confidence in myself or my abilities and I doubt myself in almost everything I do. For years I've had problems with relationships and have had bad experience with ""friends"" turning out not to be friends, so I shut myself off from others and hardly tell the truth to anyone, even my parents. After having so many friends and relationships explode in my face, I have a hard time connecting or opening up to people and admitting the truth about how I feel. Not even my parents really know how I felt until recently, and my coping methods to distract myself from my depression has almost destroyed my relationship with my parents where I don't think I can rely on them and honestly don't deserve their help.

I guess me pushing myself over the last few years hasn't helped. Because I can't do this anymore, I feel this emptiness and broken part of me inside growing more and more. I eat a lot because the taste of good food makes me happy, I spend money a lot to get that ""high"" of happiness feeling. I've gained weight, I don't exercise and use the excuse of my knees as a reason not to. I'm lonely and watch tv with my stuffed animal on the couch because its nice having it sit there and keep me company. It reminds me of when I was younger and happier. My outgoing and friendly personality has just been destroyed to the point where I don't want to be around large groups of people, I hate people, I feel irritated being in public.

I was laid off in April. I’ve been on unemployment since then. 

I’ve had plenty of interviews and some of those have felt really promising, only to be rejected. I think it’s been about 1-2 a week. It’s hard. 

Meanwhile, my car was repo’d. (Working on getting it back). 

Electric and gas were almost shut off. 

Haven’t heard back from the State of MN for emergency assistance. 

I’ve been putting off calling all those places. No idea why. Just because I literally can’t. But then I sit up all night and just expect the worst. Disconnection. No help. Etc.

,depression,"I’m not really quite sure where to start. I’m 21, female and from England. I moved to a different city 4 hours away from my hometown to study last September.
I’m quite outgoing, confident and self assured and would say that I was already quite mature and content before I left uni. I was happy within myself and was so hopeful and optimistic that my university experience would be full of opportunity and newness. 
I’m very close to my single mother and moving away was extremely hard. It was great in the beginning when I was navigating through my new city, filled with new people and it was, to me, a honeymoon stage because it didn’t last for too long. I was eating well everyday, looking after myself physically - but now the years over, I am mentally burnt out. 

I didn’t have the greatest time with friends even though I’m incredibly social. I didn’t realise the majority of people just wanted to drink and do drugs and go clubbing most of the time. I didn’t find ‘my’ people, and instead found people that loved to put me down despite how unproblematic I am. I lived with 7 other girls in uni halls and it was the worst. What helped me was my incredible lecturers, the support I had from them helped me so much. 

I spent my whole year, everyday picking myself up if I felt sad or anxious. My FOMO didn’t help either, I’ve been waiting to go to university for a very long time and the build up of expectations also led to my demise. My mum would come and stay with me for a week at a time every other month when she realised I wasn’t okay. 
Somehow I managed to pass all of my exams and my year, which I didn’t think I could do with how low I felt and how constantly ill I was getting, probs due to stress. 
My whole year I was surrounded by toxic, and negative people - who mostly dropped out towards the end anyway because they were so unserious. My coursemates are all toxic and treat the degree like it’s a competition.
I’ve come back home for summer feeling broken, feeling like I’m not who I was anymore. I feel numb, and I feel empty - I feel like nothing excites me anymore and I feel burnt out. I think my stress levels were so high this past year that my body physically can’t handle it because for the first time in my life, my face has broken out in painful eczema that won’t go away. Which doesn’t help how I’m feeling because now im back home, I just want to go out and about and distract myself from my year. 
I want to share a lot but I don’t want this post to be too long - but I do feel like, my year moving out to uni traumatised me. 
I had covid for a month in January and had never felt so alone and by myself. Trying to manage food and looking after myself was so difficult that I ended up becoming so ill, paramedics had to take me to the hospital. I had no one around me that truly cared, and it was the most isolating experience I’ve ever had. There’s a feeling I can’t shake from spending my year alone trying to navigate my world, and then the feeling of living on campus which made me feel suffocated. The food shops every week, the workload of my course, the urge to experience life in this new city and do everything I could to do it etc etc.  I think my year would’ve been the complete opposite if I didn’t live in halls, or if I had a good, consistent group of people around me. I don’t drink or smoke, and I’m not the type of person whose interested in short term relationships or flings, at heart I do feel a lot older and just crave peace. I know next year all I want to do is study, go gym and eat and sleep well and have a part time job. I really want to use these few years at uni to build a life for myself, I just don’t know where I went wrong, because whose to blame other than me.

Despite that, on the upside - I have a nice house next year which isn’t uni accommodation with two lovely girls, one who I’ve known all year. So I can’t complain about that, and my new neighbourhood is incredible. It won’t have that suffocating, uni student feel. It’s nice to be around families and kids, or older people.  I just want to heal from my past experience so I can enjoy my new chapter and hopefully a better year. 

I guess I just want some advice to heal and cope now, and to help my body mentally and physically heal. I went into uni happy, and bubbly, no self esteem issues and incredible confidence and good health. But this whole time, it’s been slowly chipping away and I’m not kind to myself one bit. I don’t feel like me, and I don’t know how to go about feeling like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Even though I passed my year and I’m proud of myself, I don’t even feel any sort of way about it. I know all of how I’m feeling is perspective and mindset, I just don’t know what I need. I do have the desire to change and work on myself to get better, if anyone has anything I could learn from to help me, I really will listen - I’m desperate. 

I have big goals after uni. To become an optometrist, and buy a home for me and my mum. I spent a few years working super hard to have saved a small deposit on a place for us both. I have a lot going for me and I’m grateful for all of my opportunities, but most of the time I just feel like I’m wasted potential but don’t know how to go about it. I constantly beat myself up and pick on myself. I sometimes wonder how I will ever be good enough for the world around me.

It&amp;#39;s rather upsetting to see so many people use this study to say that depression isn&amp;#39;t real and &amp;quot;you just need to eat better and exercise more.&amp;quot; These people probably haven&amp;#39;t ever seen what depression looks like and are just following what these &amp;#39;alpha males&amp;#39; are saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression runs in the family on my mom&amp;#39;s side and she&amp;#39;s still medicated (she&amp;#39;s also in the medical field), so I think mine is genetic rather than being cause by a tragedy. I just don&amp;#39;t know how to feel about it because there&amp;#39;s no changing their minds, I&amp;#39;ve tried. It makes me wonder if my depression is even valid.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"32, no job, never cared for a career, and frankly irritated that I was ever brought into existence.

I was just looking up suicide by hanging.

I fantasize of putting an end to it all more often than not. But I always overthink the pain, and worry whether I would fail and wind up with more day-to-day pain. 

I hate working, I have no desire to fit into society (I feel the pressures of it though), I see no point in life and struggle to create one for myself.

Anti-social, social anxiety, anhedonic depression, avoidant personality, misanthropic views... These are the main things that seem to make me me. 

I view people as the bane of my existence. 

Most of my problems are traced back to artificial creation (capitalism/the system, the double edged sword of technology etc.), and the simple fact that humans have the capacity to think about the unnecessary pointlessness of life and the inherent struggles and mortality that comes with it... And yet still choose to procreate. 

No imaginary unborn human is screaming from the void rhat they want this... It's the selfish and perhaps myopic decision of already born people.

Generic and succinct post summing up a few of the problems. 

There is no point to life, but that is not what makes me wish I could end it -- it's life itself; as soon as you are born you are instantly a thing that requires vital needs (and you need to find ways to obtain those survival needs), a thing that will experience pain and suffering guaranteed (and no promise of pleasure worth living for); and you may or may not be okay with it.

I'm not okay with it.

,depression,"My car was 10 years old with 200k miles on it and was a Ford Edge. I had wanted it to last me til kids graduate college in 1.5 years bc I just worry “what if” all the time and never buy myself anything.  My car was randomly stalling  in the middle of the road while driving and Ford couldn’t find the issue bc the car would stay on but I had to restart it and it cleared the code. It was also shifting rough, etc. So, I figured it’s time for a diff car.  It’s a bad time to buy, I know , I just didn’t feel safe pulling out etc. So I got an almost new Subaru Crosstrek, a modest car that will again last me a long time . My husband was like get u a car, u never buy shit. It’s not the money, Its in my Budget and no bills except I subsidize my kids college rent 700 a month combined (350 each with roommates). I got their tuition paid from working compulsively for 3 years. I got an extra job while they were in community college which was free in my state so they can have no debt for the last 2 years. That’s my lifetime gift to them and they are appreciative and work hard and pay the rest of their b bills.

I had wanted it to last me til kids graduate college in 1.5 years bc I just worry “what if” all the time and never buy myself anything.  My car was randomly stalling  in the middle of the road while driving and Ford couldn’t find the issue bc the car would stay on but I had to restart it and it cleared the code. It was also shifting rough, etc. So, I figured it’s time for a diff car.  It’s a bad time to buy, I know , I just didn’t feel safe pulling out etc. So I got an almost new Subaru Crosstrek, a modest car that will again last me a long time . My husband was like get u a car, u never buy shit. It’s not the money, Its in my Budget and no bills except I subsidize my kids college rent 700 a month combined (350 each with roommates). I got their tuition paid from working compulsively for 3 years. I got an extra job while they were in community college which was free in my state so they can have no debt for the last 2 years. That’s my lifetime gift to them and they are appreciative and work hard and pay the rest of their b bills. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am in an extreme level of mental, emotional, and spiritual pain and agony at all times, and have been nearly non-stop for the last 15 years. I have Bipolar type I disorder and the depressive episodes, which last over a year, are un-endurable. I am incapable of killing myself, because first of all, I am too scared, and second, it would only cause more complications (more negative karma, family grief, etc.) from all that I have read. Every few years the symptoms improve and then I sometimes go into a manic state, but eventually I fall right back to the deep, black depressions every time. I have done a ridiculous amount of work on myself but I always end up right back where I started. It's insane.

I have tried every conceivable remedy over the years and nothing has worked. Medications don't work, therapy doesn't work, and even psychedelics don't work. I have sought out every type of healing method around the world, and nothing has helped. I am not kidding when I say that I have tried it all. I have scoured the internet over the years searching every possible thing I could do and nothing has changed. All it has done is reinforced the idea that there is something horribly wrong with me, or my soul. Year after year, the pain continues. I keep sinking lower and lower into hell. Lots of people around me get better, but I don't, and I don't know why.

One of the worst aspects of this is that I am unable to connect to other people. I am so far disconnected from others that social interactions are painful and almost unbearable. My reality and state of consciousness is always flooded with this psychic and emotional pain that I am unable to experience love. There is no thought, memory or imagination that can change this state. It's pure pain, all the time, every day.

Statistically speaking, it is unlikely to ever get better for me, unless there will be some miraculous treatment that comes out of science which is highly unlikely, given that society is in a state of collapse and mental health is the last priority in this capitalistic world.

My every-day reality is one of extreme, 10 out of 10 suffering on a daily basis. I have exhausted every heroic attempt to get better and I am at the point where all I have is patient endurance. That's it. There's nothing more than endurance at this point. So then, what is the point of life? This game is certainly not worth the candle, but I am not allowed to quit, so what other conclusion can I draw but that it is a punishment?

So I endure this thing, day after day, as the world goes by.

I have ready many NDE reports, and all I can hope is that this thing ends soon for me. From the perspective of me to my soul, all I can say is that this learning experiment is highly unethical. It has caused a level of suffering for me that I could not ever imagine was possible on a human level. I hope and pray to god that it ends soon.

I have learned a tremendous amount on the spiritual level, mostly from reading. From the Buddhist perspective there is of course equanimity, but when all you have is nothing but extreme levels of pain and suffering, the idea of equanimity becomes a joke.

For me, and I am sure for many others, this place is a living hell. I have done my absolute best to get better and nothing has worked. What other conclusions can I draw from my life?

When my time eventually comes, I can only wonder whether (in the spirit world) I will laugh or I will cry. I understand that it is a learning experience to know contrast and bla blah blah, but from the perspective of this lifetime, it is a torture chamber, and nothing more.

I know that I am not the only one. I am sorry that we are at a point in this human experience where we only have very limited remedies for this kind of thing. I hope and pray for you that your next lifetime, wherever it may be, contains less suffering. I hope to never come back to this place. The highs are certainly not worth the lows. Not even close.

,depression,"Ive have a mild depression and rn struggling from quite bad anxiety. My mother says that depression is a luxury because the poor just push the depression on the side to work for food. She laughs at me when I try to vent and tells me to deal with it or go suicide (as a joke “oh it’s funny, you’re sensitive”). Other “jokes” such as: “wow you look depressed” “haha my child’s depressed” “you’re depressed again? Go die” “you’re so hard to deal with, I’m tired and this is what you do to me” “you should be glad that…” etc etc. 

She tells me to just push it away and distract myself, that everything is psychological (ofc that’s the truth, but she’s telling me as if I can snap out of it) and essentially I’m focusing on myself too much whilst others just “deal with it” and don’t baby about it. She taught me how to hide my feelings, called me a spoiled brat, etc. I think I am spoiled though (we are ~ middle class) and I do think I get love in some way from her, but I feel guilty for feeling this way and I feel like a whiner. She told me I could always talk to her whenever I need to, and she’ll help me but now she’s literally taking my shit as stand up comedy.

Even sleeping is hard because my brain gets so bored of just sitting there, but I&amp;#39;m too tired to do anything else. I hate feeling so uncomfortable and weird, even when I&amp;#39;m just doing nothing. It feels like everything is just like a layer of skin I want to peel off. I just want to be able to sit down and play Animal Crossing without feeling like a failure. I want to be able to play minecraft without crumpling up my paper full of ideas, and crying because nothing makes me happy. The only times I feel good are when i get random feelings of euphoria and creativity for like 20 seconds. Nothing triggers it. Nothing strengthens it. It just randomly happens like once or twice a day, and that&amp;#39;s all I have to look forward to. I hate just loosing whatever thought I have because of my stupid ADHD. I hate that I&amp;#39;m always paranoid that I&amp;#39;m forgetting something. I hate that I can&amp;#39;t remember the simplest things. I hate making lists to try to help myself, because they never make it better. I hate that the only reason I play webkinz and Animal Crossing is because they are like a chore. They don&amp;#39;t even make me happy, but I feel the need to do all of the stupid daily things. I&amp;#39;m so tired of the constant med changes. I&amp;#39;m so tired of being unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So, this is my first post on here. I've mostly been reading and commenting the last few weeks. Not sure why I'm doing this now but I guess I just also wanna get shit off my shoulders.

Quick backstory: adusive narcissistic parents, never allowed to be sad, strict rules, isolated, depressed since around 13, didn't feel safe talking to anyone, made to always feel like the worst and a failure, thought it was all normal. I attempted to take my life at 14. Later went to uni, found out my life was far from normal. Finally tried to get help and moved out. I am 23 with a stable job and recently cut ties with my parents.

Back to current time: although I'm getting help, I have a support system, I am dating an awesome girl, I still can't stop my brain from making me feel like shit. Like I don't deserve anything. Like my feelings aren't valid. Everyone hates me. I am starting to spiral now again and have started cutting again. I have ""casual"" suicidal thoughts in the back of my head. I have started seeking ways to get out of this reality, even for just a moment (aka alcohol and drugs). And I'm scared of where this is going. I know these thoughts aren't logical but they get to me anyway.

I am honest, to an extent, about that I'm not doing good for my coworkers, friends and HR at work. But I don't think they get how serious things have become. And I can't imagine how they would even help in the first place even if they knew. I guess I feel so isolated.

,depression,"Apologies in advance for the dramatic language, it’s a but embarrassing but oh well. 

I realise that ever since I was young, probably about 11, every year that passes has been a notch in the belt of my self hatred. 

I have watched the approach of New Years, birthdays, Halloween’s, each time promising myself that I will be a better person on this milestone day. A person worth being here. Someone better than the person making that promise. Each event comes and goes, and I have had to sit back and accept that I am still myself, and that seemingly I will never care about myself enough to change. I will never lose the weight. Dye my hair. Get a job. Get prettier, funnier, be more successful in a way that I can bring up to myself in bulletpoints, to then show to friends or family members who ask how I’m doing. 

But I did make those changes. I did lose weight. Changed my hair. Got a job. Did all the things I wanted to do. And almost as soon as I had them I threw them away. I don’t love myself enough to bother trying. Even if I prove I can succeed, underneath my success is a person that I for some reason truly do despise. I have never hated another person the way I hate myself. What feels like hatred for others is shown in actions, or more often thoughts, of a passionate nature. Imagining hitting, screaming, fighting that person. The hate I have for myself is deeper because it’s not this superficial, firey hate that inspires actions. It doesn’t go away after time. It’s a cold and neglectful hate. I watch myself isolate, run out of medication, eat like shit and sleep like I have nothing worth waking up for. I do nothing about this. Or almost nothing. Because at the very least I do question myself. I stop and think, wonder why I treat myself this way. I’ve done this or some variation of this for the past 13 years. If I had been raising a child this way the product would at best be a self hating shell of a teenager who has no obligation to live other than not wanting to seem ungrateful. But more likely, that child would have died of starvation and neglect over a decade ago.

I am shocked. I have known I didn’t like myself, but to finally allow myself to truly see, I am just in a state of plain shock. That this is the person I’ve become.

1. Feeling out of place even when you know you've been accepted by your peers.

2. Feeling out of place even when in doing an activity you used to love.

3. After 8 months of dealing with anxiety and deppression you still feel out of place around family members even though all they want to do is help.

4. Unable to exercise becuase the voice in your head tells you ""What's the point it's not gonna do anything?""

5. Absolutely 0 self confidence even in your own job that you've been doing for 5+ years.

6. Overly nice to everyone for no reason, all because you can't think of how to stand up for yourself ever. Ps -I'm not even great at being nice just overly apologetic and polite.

7. Sometimes you get caught in this empty loop in your head where you're just freaking out. It's like your head won't tell you what you want or desire. You just get all hot and sweaty and uncomfortable as can be and there's almost nothing you can do to stop it.

8. You feel as though you lack the abillity to raise children even though you've done it for 7+ years.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you get caught in this empty loop in your head where you&amp;#39;re just freaking out. It&amp;#39;s like your head won&amp;#39;t tell you what you want or desire. You just get all hot and sweaty and uncomfortable as can be and there&amp;#39;s almost nothing you can do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You feel as though you lack the abillity to raise children even though you&amp;#39;ve done it for 7+ years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you do fun things there&amp;#39;s no inner dialogue to yourself it&amp;#39;s just a feeling of joy and the only thing you can think about is how thankful you are that you get a short break from your everyday negative thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Especially when I can&amp;#39;t sleep, like right now. Whenever I try to fall asleep it seems like I clench my teeth or shake a little. I feel like I am filled to the brim with nothing but stress, but at the same time am I just overreacting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as though no one gives a singular shit about me. I guess I deserve it, since I don&amp;#39;t really give a shit about them either. Does that make me a bad person? I never asked to be on this stupid fucking planet. I just got shot out of a vagina, which I am still yet to get any of as a 20 year old virgin man. That shit makes me feel so pathetic. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t care but I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as though no one truly understands me. Sometimes I wonder if I&amp;#39;m autistic or something. There&amp;#39;s definitely something very wrong with me mentally. And it makes me feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve anything good. It&amp;#39;s only natural selection, that my poor genetics should not reproduce and have kids. Unfortunately, my mentally ill parents did not realize that they shouldn&amp;#39;t have had kids. I do not want to have kids. At all. People think I&amp;#39;m gonna change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I will. The world is too fucked of a place for me to even have the desire to have kids. I do not want to pass on my mentally fucked genetics to another poor soul. I just can&amp;#39;t have that on my conscience. This turned into a rant. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t want to answer texts right away (or at all). I’ve ghosted some people because I just can’t keep up and find the energy to stay engaged in conversations. I feel like I don’t know how to talk to people, and that makes me feel alienated even more. I see my friends and neighbors hang out without me, and it makes me feel sad.

After that I lost myself in depression, blaming myself for ruining our lives.

I have taken away a lot of his happiness because of the way I am.

I call him terrible names and get so angry. 

Verbally and emotionally abusive towards him.

I can't leave the house and we have no friends.

Back and forth we go dancing with my extreme emotions.

Which wife will it be today - happy sad or bitchy.

That night we got into a big fight and I called him terrible things.

I used to run away a lot when it became too much.

I used to hide out in the park bathroom to cry.

When I came home he was turning red and couldn't breathe.

He said he was tired of being my punching bag.

That still haunts me.

To be the victim, you victimize others too.

To be hurt, means you hurt others too.

To the way I am and the ways I have hurt him.

I keep thinking about how his life would be easier without me in it.

He's happier, he's working hard, and he's in a better environment now.

Things are looking up for him, and so I can be at peace knowing he's okay.

Yet, he tells me he's sad to leave me when he goes to work and comes home seeing me in the same spot. He tells me he's sad to see me so broken.

I don't want to ruin his life anymore.

I don't want to be the source of his pain.

It doesn't get easier over time.

Depression always comes back around.

This time, I don't know how to stop it.

I don't know how to stop life except through death.

i live inside my head constantly from the moment i wake up to when i close my eyes to sleep. i’ve grown an extreme amount of hatred for myself unlike anyone else on this planet because of it. from overthinking every situation i put in my head to anything i can think of. i’ve been tossed around and treated like shit by a lot of people in my 18 years of living. i have no love for myself whatsoever. i have little to no trust in anyone, also because of how i’ve been treated. so in my constant state overthinking it always turns to self hatred. that being because of guilt or just being tired of living in my head. for example, i feel guilty for overthinking everything my gf does and thinking almost anything she does is a way to backstab me even tho i’m almost positive she isn’t trying to hurt me or do me dirty. only because i’ve been so scarred by other people. i just can’t stand who i am i’m filled with rage and uncomfortableness being in my own skin. i’ve never been more comforted by the thought of blowing my brains out till now, even when i tried to overdose twice. but lucky me i can’t kill myself, i couldn’t do that to my family, close friends, and gf. my gf has a grieving disorder which could really fuck her up, and it would also devastate my closest friends for eternity. it gives me a large amount of pain not being able to end my own life

another thing, i suffer really horribly with dpdr (depersonalization/dissociation disorder). nothing feels real and i constantly live life as a spectator and it’s only made me more depressed. i can barley even think and output a sentence with people because of how bad it is. when existence isn’t comfortable at all with all these intrusive thoughts i have and existential dread/thinking. i have really bad ocd and it’s part of the reason why i’m still dealing with chronic dpdr

also, i also have sleep insomnia. so i can’t even sleep to avoid depression i just there and be in my head like always but it’s even worse whenever i’m trying to sleep. and i’m aware that healthy amounts of sleep can help a lot with mental health but again, i’m blessed with another problem with me.

,depression,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this, or if this is even a depression thing, but it’s the only formal dx I’ve ever had in my past. So wondering if this is a symptom or if anyone experiences the same thing.   

Any time I make a mistake that other people notice it seems to affect me so strongly it ruins my life for a long time after. Other people don’t seem to experience this (even other depressed people I know, which is why I hesitate to say if this is a symptom of depression). It doesn’t matter what it is, but social mistakes seem to be worse than others. If I say something wrong, or do the wrong thing, I basically have an emotional meltdown. It’s so embarrassing. I have to hide that I’m immediately fighting tears and it’s all I can think about for weeks. I remember every embarrassing moment and mistake from my whole life in vivid detail. Even if it’s an honest and understandable mistake that anyone would make, it ruins me. But if someone else were to do the same thing, I would never judge them so harshly.   

Here’s an example: when I was 8 years old, my mom went to pick something up from someone who lived in a house I’d never been to. She left me in the car, and told me she would be back soon, but she was gone longer than that. I got worried and went into the backyard of the house I thought she was at, and started playing in a little kid play structure. A lady who lived there came out after a little bit, freaking out at me. I panicked and asked where my mom was, and she made me go out front, and found the house next door where my mom actually was. She chewed me out, then chewed my mom out for leaving me alone, I remember really clearly “Your DAUGHTER was TRESSPASSING. Do you know how dangerous that is?” My mom tried to make me feel better but i was inconsolable. As an adult in their 30s with common sense, I know she was at least a little in the wrong to have such an angry reaction about a lost kid. But when I think about it, I still hate my child self, and feel beyond embarrassed.   

These days when I say things or do things where I’m totally in the wrong, I lose it even if other people are being objectively kind or correct in their criticism. It’s caused me to drift away from so many friends and activities I enjoy. My opinion of myself is so low at this point I hardly even try to be out or social anymore.    

Is there a name for this? Does anyone else feel this or is this just general patheticness? I’ve been told so much that i need to stop saying sorry and get a thicker skin, which just makes me feel worse.

,depression,"All my senses are dulled or reduced really.

My smell and taste is dulled, my vision and hearing is dulled, my sense of touch is dulled and so is my sense of temperature. Dont really Feel heat or cold that much. It is like an invisable layer between me and the world. Like my brain just disconnected.

We are in the middle of a heat wave and i cant Feel the heat really. It is so strange. 

When i swim at the beach it is like i cant Feel the water. It feels like i an floating in air. 

My skin feels really numb to the touch. Like i wear pants, but cant really Feel the clothes on my skin properly. My body just feels sort of dead when i touch it.

My insides also feels numb. Normally if i touch my stomach when i have to pee, in hurts in my bladder. Cant really Feel that anymore. Also dont really Feel pain so just have to guess when i need to pee.

My body feels strangely lightweight, and like it is not fully there! My limbs Feel strange and dead.

all i think about in public now is how people are able to make it to their 30s-40s without losing their mind or how people can just .. function normally  i literally look at random people and just wonder how they’re doing it. because Idk my anxiety prevents me from literally doing anything i can’t even go to the store or do anything normal.

on top of everything i’m going through,
all i see is people constantly debating my existence and identity when i just want to live as a man and that’s all.

I just feel like i will never be able to  say it out loud to anyone but my girlfriend anymore without being a walking trans flag and It fucking sucks…

,depression,"(Mega-post). Basically what the title says. This summer has been the worst summer of my life, and the 2nd lowest I’ve felt in my life so far. I really just want to use this post as a safe place to vent, I’ve already written in my journal but it’s 3 am and I’m still having lingering thoughts, so hell why not. 

Well for starters I just recently turned 19 on July 29th. I spent my whole birthday miserable, constantly crying and stressing because I caught my boyfriend, who I’ve been with for what would’ve been a year next month, cheating on me. I caught him using dating apps behind my back (again), and not only that but he’d been texting and sending nudes to other people behind my back. This was my first relationship ever and the longest I’ve ever been with someone. We both got through our freshman year of college together, and he’s the only person that’s made my experience a little better. Since we’ve been together we never missed a day without talking until the days following that whole debacle (which was like 2/3 weeks ago). It hurts so much bc he was also my best friend and I trusted and loved him so much, so I feel so broken, betrayed, and naive. At first he tried to say he was using those apps bc he was worried that i was upset bc of our distance (it was a long distance relationship), and then he came back and said he felt like I didn’t love him as much (which felt like a huge slap in the face because I did anything for him). Eventually he apologized, and I accepted it. We‘re trying to move on and rebuild our relationship but it just doesn’t feel the same. Especially with my anxiety and overthinking getting the best of me since he’s stopped calling me and whenever we go long hours without texting. He works from morning to afternoon so I try to be very understanding of that however within the hours of us not texting I’d see him actively on social media. Well anyways we got into a disagreement yesterday because he complained about the way I texted, and I brought up that situation again. We haven’t texted since last night. Ik this sounds dumb but I’m worried it may now be officially over, and everytime I say that my stomach drops bc he’s the only person I have left, and the only person I feel close to. 

So that took a big toll on me. And now I feel so alone because I’ve pushed everyone out of my life, the little friends I had, him, everyone. Im very shy, and I have a hard time approaching anyone so I don’t really have any friends or a friend group. I’m very quiet and I stay to myself a lot. The only other friend that I was actively communicating with randomly stopped talking to me and we haven’t spoken since June. I usually always had my boyfriend by my side, so I never felt alone, but now he’s gone too. 

Those were just the major causes of my terrible summer. 

Since I came home from school I spent days/weeks/months on applications and going to interviews just to get declined from every job I applied for. I only recently got a job earlier in the past month at FedEx, and I had to leave after 2 weeks bc the work conditions were terrible. 

I just feel so worthless and lonely. I’ve even let go of my looks bc of how terrible I’ve been feeling. Everytime I feel like things are getting better they get worse, and every day seems to be worse than the previous. Every new person I’ve met has misunderstood me and in turn left, so I just gave up. I’m so tired of crying that I don’t even think I have anymore tears left in me now. I just feel emotionless, just a shell of who I used to be. I don’t even feel like myself, I feel so broken. I spent the whole summer in the house in my room, playing music and video games. Sometimes they help but even that gets boring quick and eventually my thoughts will come creeping back up on me.

And now I have to go back to school in 2 weeks not only carrying this stress, but having to worry about getting out of academic probation. Stuck in my dorm room again just like last year, with no friends, only this time i won’t have a boyfriend either there for me.

I just wanna disappear. It’s 3 am rn and I’m trying to stay up as late as possible so I can sleep all day without having to worry about today’s pain. I wish I could never wake up.

I occasionally have running thoughts about suicide but I could never bring myself to do it bc I’m afraid of pain. 

I sometimes wonder if I disappeared would it really impact anybody, would anyone really care, would they notice I’m gone

I kind of feel bad for posting this here bc it just feels so selfish and tiny compared to what other may be dealing with but I just really feel so lost and have a lot I want to get off of my chest.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just have a lot on my mind. Also sorry if it sounds like I’m rambling, I’m not good at explaining myself and I usually keep my issues to myself.

,depression,"my brother has been behaving in an aggressive/thuggish manner for the last 3 years now, he's disrespectful with parents, aggressive, wants to do whatever he wants and to be given whatever he wants, otherwise he'll snap and start shouting and being aggressive, leaves the house dirty (kithcen all shitted up with food and never clean), wakes up my parents every night in the middle of it, literally every night basically, bc he watches tv and is loud when cooking at 3am or doing stuff.

my parents in my opinion handled this in a stupid way, they just talk, complain to him, tell him what to do/not to do(like he cares), then start arguing even between the 2 of them bc they told him to do 2 different things they disagree on, then start discussing, my brother goes out with subhumans lowlifes, sells drugs, gets drunk, steals cheap stuff or alchol from stores.

my parents refuse to expel him from the house , especially my mother, bc hes 17 so she says that he'll get caught by the police for something and then they'll call and they'll have to take him back otherwise theyll get sued for abandoning him, but also even when they can be ""relaxed"", better said left alone, they sekk him because ""he's still our son"", so for example this exact night as im writing to vent, as of 3 minutes ago: my brother came home drunk, they told him to go to bed

etc(thats the main thing bc he always wakes them up so they want him to sleep, also he sleeps all day till 12/16pm,), he refused and an argument ensued, also thanks to their retarded way of

handling the thing which is ranting on what he has to do etc and venting their stress, while he doesnt do what they told him and it happened that it got physical once and he assaulted my father

and then i intervened and assaulted my brother, then my father said he was having a hearth attack and we stopped) anyway in the end they managed to make my brother go out of the house, so what does

my father do after 20 mins? he goes out to search him, different variations of this have been happening literally on loop almost every day for the last 3 years, my parents arent divorced but

just in the eye of the law. note that i assaulted my brother 3 times, once he shitted up the kitched, i asked him to clean, he refused smugly, i snapped and started punching him in the ribs,

not even a fight it lasted 30 seconds at most then we separated, another time i came home from running and came to the garage and heard spitting sounds and saw a light on inside it, it was

my brother with a friend and he was spitting inside the garage, it was closed, i told him to stop and he again refused smugly, i opened the garage and punched him in the face and a fist fight

ensued, it lasted some minutes and i knocked him down kinda once (when you see all the white stars and jump a second forward in time), then my mother came home from work and started shouting and we stopped.

then the third that i mentioned earlier he assaulted my father after the usual shit bc my father snapped this time and punched him, i came downstairs (im usually a passive listener to the

arguemtns bc my presence would only worse things, especially given how they want to manage the situation). i called the cops i think 2/3 times saying he was assaulting my father, they came 45 minutes later and he was either gone or

they just brought him to the station, and the let him come back the same day after a few hours, they dont give a shit about the whole situation, but if i killed him then they would care and

actually arrest me the faggots, my parents even called the cops saying he had drugs (true) and they didnt arrest him bc that one time he didnt have it (my parents found it multiple times),

he got arrested for stealing a shirt, did nothing, so basically for the law you just have to be a passive and do nothing, bc if as i said killed him or if my parents abandoned him, its probable

/sure they'd do something this time, especially the first case. i can go live alone (im 20) but im doing uni and here in italy id be a wagie forever if i go working now (i know bc i already

worked and am currently, in the last 3 years summers, this included, i worked, and the pay is miserable for full time jobs, like 1000euros/months if youre lucky, otherwise less, for full time,

if you go in the trades you can make slightly more but have long ass hours, but in general all those arent things id want to have to do for the rest of my life), also yesterday he came knocking

on my door at 00:40, i made the stupid error of opening, he wanted me to open the house door so he could go out do his stuff, i refused, and he insisted (its favourite method, to just tire you

down until you concede, my parents always do so it works for  him, especially my father so he always asks him), i refused bc i hate him, he sat on my chair and said he wouldnt leave until i

said yes, then started saying that i've always bullied him since he was little and always beat him up (false, when we were little it happened we had little sibling fights or that i hit him

because he annoyed me on purpose sometimes, but it was rare, often we played toghter too so its made up and exxaggerated), anyway he then starts saying he can have me killed by his friends

with just one phone call etc, then challenges me to attack him and fight him to remove him from my room since i asked him to leave, we stay there a couple of minutes in silence looking at each

other and i think what to do, assaulting him doesnt seems advantageous, i see it as a 50/50, not good odds, then i decide to fake conceding, i take the keys and tell him i'll do it, he starts

going downstairs in front of me, i tought about kicking him down the stairs and then beating him while he was down but he was suspicious and kept looking behind him, anyway he went take his shoes

and i locked him out of my room and the upper floor where my room is, he snapped and started screaming and saying hell kill me etc, i called the cops again, (btw i have no faih in them theyre useless

faggots, but i always hope something happens and they finally arrest him or shoot him, like if he assaults them(which he half assedly did multiple time btw), ah yes also one time he was arrested

bc he beat up a guy while he was out idk the detail, he said the guy was making fun of him, people called the cops, he assaulted them, got handcuffed and brought to the station, released same day,

meaniwhile i was behind a wall behind the door with my bowie knife in case he broke in, a tactic i already used with succes is to close my bedroom door to make him think im loked in then hide

behind a wall or in the adjacent room or something like that, the other time he fell in the trap then my father calmed him, this time he didnt get inside. i sincerely would like to kill him

myself, the problem is the probability of getting away with it are slim and i dont want to ruin my life forever for that, so idk, i try calling the cops when he snaps but they dont do shit, arrive

45 minutes late, or like today they dont even come after saying they will, (ofc they know our names from the previous times so when i call they know what it is and they avoided it this time)

also theres the excuse of mental illness and that he takes meds, goes to the psycologist and psychiatrist, so hes not a subhuman piece of shit but hes mentally ill (depending on my parents

mood its one or the other but their actions indicate the mentally ill thing is what drives their actions since they keep staying behind him).

so idk i hate staying at my house, when i hear a voice while at home i get alerted and have to go look whats going on, i always lock my door when i sleep, i have the desire of killing my brother

and stab him while he sleeps in the neck multiple times, most days the evening is filled with adrenaline and tension because of the stuff that happens, and also i dont like how i am bc at the

moment im being a subhuman that goes to bed late, plays alot videogames, and doesnt study, i like reading books but i rarely do, i like going outdoors but i rarely do, i have no friends,

but i have a gf lol, im being shit at uni, im behind with exams, and feel constantly unsatisfied by myself bcause of those reasons while also doing nothing, also i stopped working out, before

i was ripped as fuck, i did competitive boxing, then the will waned and i stopped, now i work out rarely like 3 times a month i go running but thats it.

my only consolation is that at least im working, btw the first year i got scammed and worked 10/11 hours a day for 3 weeks as a waiter and got 200 euros, the year after i did real estate agent 5 weeks

got 1000 euros, fine, but my parents stopped giving me allowance(200/400 euros every 3/4 months because i make it last, btw they complain if spend them on stuf i like such as milsurp gear instead

of what they like such as restaurants, which i love but theyre expensive so i dont want to blow my money), anyway i made my 1000 euros last like 5 months including a vacation but for the rest i

didnt buy anything i wanted like a retard so its like i didnt work, bc i knew they would give me allowance again if i finished them. now i worked in a warehouse for 2 weeks approx but the manager

was a retard and snapped on me bc i asked him info on the contract he offered me since it was very different from what we had talked about, so i left, at least theyll pay me the weeks i did,

or so they say, now i have a cushy job i a restaurant of people i know, i do part time 4/5 hourse at dinner usually and they pay 35/30 a day when i do the whole 4/5 hours (today there wasnt many

people so i only stayed 2 hours then they closed so i got 20euros), its cushy, pays kinda well, its close to home, but they close in 2 weeks plus they already have a waiter but hes on vacation

so idk if itll keep going after the summer. anyway thats my wall of text vent bc i have no friends and my gf already knows all of this and i dont want to repeat it to her a 1000 times plus

shes not well at the moment with health (nothing serious) so i dont want to burden her, oh and to add to the misery my father has a spine problem so he basically almost cant walk, at least

,depression,"Hi. I’m gonna vomit because I need an outlet.

Rough childhood. Youngest to 3 older brothers. Shit hit the fan when I was young within my family. Just one example: I was born during the trial for my grandma’s pedophilia (I was not a victim, my brothers were). So, now that I’m older, I’m realizing all of my terrible depressive habits have been implanted since day 1 because they were survival mechanisms for the shit show that was my home life. 

I hate myself. I have dirt poor self-esteem. My life is incredibly compartmentalized. And my form of self-harm is being a workaholic. I don’t do anything I love. I can’t bring myself to. But most of all, I can’t have a relationship with my parents. 

My family is significantly better now. Every family member in my life goes to therapy (except for me), my parents are incredible people and I’m so lucky to have them because they were able to personally change and provide for my brothers and I, even through the traumatic events. All that to say I want a relationship with them. So. Badly. I love my mom and my dad. But I haven’t told them that since I was a literal toddler.

I think this stems from compartmentalizing my relationships. I was (and still am) the good “normal” child, unproblematic, high achieving, classic case of stuffing my feelings in a suitcase and not revealing any of them. My relationship with my family is very transactional as a result. It’s hard to describe, but I feel like a burden if I’m not just a ghost. I know it’s irrational, but my brain is like: 
- Mom: generic greeting
- Me: cannot respond to greeting even though I desperately want to. I simply ignore her.
- mom: “how was your day?”
- me: “fine”
- “any plans?”
- “No.” 

You know how it goes. It’s extremely cold behavior. They don’t know me. I don’t smile around them. They don’t know my hobbies. They don’t know my favorite foods. I can’t be a person to my parents. I just can’t. That’s not what my brain thinks our relationship is for. I exist to make their lives easier. My friends are the people who are allowed to “know” me. Not my family. Graduating high school was terrible. I hated having to be the object of my family’s attention with no way to circumvent it (I’m the only one of my brothers to graduate high school, so it was a big deal for them). 

Anyways, exposition over, here’s the current issue: I’m young. I’m 18. I live with my family. I’m about to move to college in 2 weeks and forever not be a kid anymore. So, I want to make the most of these last two weeks. I know they’re precious. I don’t want an emotional repeat of my graduation. But I can’t. I can’t open up. I can’t walk out of my room and just spend time with them. I can’t have a conversation with them. The thought of doing so makes me so uncomfortable. 

In general I’m in the dumpster right now, mentally. Feeling hopeless about my future, especially with regards to my interpersonal relationships. Any consolations at all would be appreciated because I have the opportunity to change my life once I move and “start anew”, whatever that means. Thanks for reading if you cared to.

,depression,"Just needed a place to say this. Job hunting while depressed is a serious trigger. I had mentioned to a friend that I was burnt out at my current job, and starting looking in a completely different industry. It just so happened that his brother had a connection in one of my dream job industries, so he told me to send my info and resume to his brother, and his brother would ""put me on top of the pile.""

I'm sure I don't have to tell anyone here that -- between the burn out, the imposter syndrome, and the depression -- just getting a decent cover letter written was a fucking roller-coaster. How are you supposed to convince other people to give you a chance when you have nothing good to say about yourself? I deleted and retyped the thing probably twelve times. It still sort of sucked, but I sent it anyway. And now I feel like I'm putting my friends' brother in a weird spot, because he said he'd help me out but what if he sees my stuff and thinks, ""she's got no experience and very little going for her, she's got no chance."" But he has to ""put me on top of the pile"" anyways because he said he would.

I realize this is just the depression talking, and that worst case scenario is I just don't get an interview. But the whole time I just kept thinking....... *I'm depressed because I'm stuck in a job I don't really want, but the depression is making it so hard to get out of that job. So I stay, and I get more depressed. And it's even harder to get out.*

I wish there was some sort of industry made specifically for depressed people. Where getting a chance at an interview doesn't depend on how much and how well you can brag about yourself. And interviewing well doesn't depend on how good you are at bullshitting and spinning words.

Job hunting while depressed is a serious trigger. I had mentioned to a friend that I was burnt out at my current job, and starting looking in a completely different industry. It just so happened that his brother had a connection in one of my dream job industries, so he told me to send my info and resume to his brother, and his brother would &amp;quot;put me on top of the pile.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t have to tell anyone here that -- between the burn out, the imposter syndrome, and the depression -- just getting a decent cover letter written was a fucking roller-coaster.

S Hello friends w depression, I wanted to ask if this happens to anyone else.
I have severe chronic depression, mostly from living w an abusive family who treat me horribly and used to beat me as a child. I’m trying to get out, I actually have a job interview on Tuesday which I am looking forward to, but the aftermath of my depression room has started an infestation of fruit flies.
I can hear them buzzing around me as I sleep, has anyone else had this..? I tried to confide with my abusive mother who recently moved in w me and my grandma after being kicked out bc she believed it’s okay to not pay her rent and thought she was invincible, and instead screamed at me bc the flies were coming out of my room. 
I just wanted her to ask if I was okay or something, but that’s literally never happened before so why would it now? I’m going to clean my room properly, top to bottom today, in preparation for a new life. If I get the job from the interview I’m moving out. Nothing can save me from my depression if I stay here. I’m constantly traumatised, having ptsd flashbacks, surrounded by the people who caused 98% of my trauma. It’s gotten worse since my parents moved in. 

There’s literally hundreds in my room, and it’s disgusting.. I disassociate in my depressive episodes so I can’t remember how I got here. One minute my room was clean, the next I’m sat here tonight surrounded by hundreds of them. I don’t realise it till it gets To this point.

,depression,"First off: boring exposition. I was bullied for most of my adolescent years (around age 10 to 18) and missed out on any social experience you'd probably have in that time. Then I switched schools and things started looking up because I got a fresh start and somewhat managed to hide my social incompetence. I at least made some superficial friendships that didn't last past graduation. Right after graduating I started having chronic pain that lasted for 2 years and left me bedridden for ~6 months while the few people I was still in contact with at the time moved on with their lives. After I somewhat recovered I enrolled in university but was too socially awkward to make any new acquaintances.

So here I am 4 years into uni: I'm in my mid 20s. The only ""friend"" I have is someone from university but we basically don't meet outside of study groups. Never been in a relationship or anything of the sort.

Don't have any real hobbies and basically nothing to do outside of university (no courses this semester) and work (I come in maybe once every two weeks when there's something to do). Most days I wake up, turn on my computer, turn it off again 10 minutes later because there's nothing to do and just lie in bed waiting for the day to be over.

I can't find the energy to do anything. I moved into a new apartment a few months ago and it still looks like I just moved in because I can't motivate myself to unpack my stuff just so it can sit on a shelf.

I'm just so lonely. Whenever I do somehow meet new people its mostly through others and I feel like I'm always just the ""friend of a friend"" that is instantly forgotten afterwards.

I don't know if this makes sense, but: the only joy I have experienced in recent years was when I could help the people around me with their problems, but there is just no one around to ask me for help.

I know the ""obvious"" approach would be getting into a hobby that allows me to meet new people but I either can't find any interest in a new hobby or I'm too terrified of those kinds of social interactions.

I don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings. My relationship with my family is too superficial and I don't want to lose the only friend I have left. I've tried getting professional help a few times over the years but I couldn't even get an appointment with a therapist since they were always overwhelmed with patients, so I gave up on that. I've been prescribed antidepressants before for my chronic pain but I honestly didn't feel any change in my emotions/mindset/motivation.

I&amp;#39;ve tried getting professional help a few times over the years but I couldn&amp;#39;t even get an appointment with a therapist since they were always overwhelmed with patients, so I gave up on that.

Sorry if this is a bit ramble-y. 

  I started this job a while ago; my first job out of school. It's BARELY in my field, but I really don't mind the work. Unfortunately, my department head is another story. He's abrasive to say the least. Ya know those awful intrusive thoughts that tend to stick in your mind? It's like he knows them and uses them like weapons. It doesn't feel like ""critique"" but more like hardcore criticism of my work and myself. He'll compare me to my more established co-workers, offer little reassurance or praise on my work, and will degrade when possible. He doesn't believe I ""look mentally ill"" because ""I'm just so put together."" However, he has told my co-workers that I'm mentally ill and on meds (I hadn't told anyone about the meds and told him that I'm depressed in confidence.) Sidenote: I put a whole bunch of effort in my appearance, in hopes that I'll feel a little more confident while going through my day. It almost kind of helps.

I've only been here a few months- not even long enough to justify a resume spot yet. It's so hard waking up to go work with THAT. He dug in enough where I had a full blown panic attack earlier this week and it's really been affecting my morale. I've barely been holding it together. Yes, it's a job during a recession. Yes, it pays bills. I should be happy, but I feel my brain getting worse and worse. I've job-hopped in the past (usually due to me not taking care of my mental health) and I don't want to quit this on a whim if my boss is the only bad part of the job. Still, it's hard when I work like 6feet away from the guy.

If I don't enjoy life, why should I keep on going? The only reason I am still here typing this useless post is because a) I have failed to kms previously and b) I find a bit of strength to keep going because of my dog. Although sometimes when I'm looking at my dog I feel enormous amounts of guilt and sadness because I feel like I don't deserve her. I often apologize to her for me being the way that I am and that she is so unlucky for ending up with me. I do everything I can to give her the best life possible but I just can't shake that feeling.

I have been in therapy since I was 16 and I am now 27. There have been little bits of progress in those 10 years but still I feel like doing the world a favor and just end my life. I guess the biggest thing I achieved was me sort of quitting self harm, and that wasn't even because of myself but because I got put on meds to help control the urges. I still have the urges every now and then but even when I hurt myself I get angry at myself for not doing it ""good enough"".

I have failed in everything I have tried, didn't finish school, never really had a job, no hobby or whatever that excites me, never had a romantic relationship or friends for that matter. Basically I have always been alone and don't have much hope that it will change anytime soon. I don't see a meaningful and successful existence in my future so I am struggling a lot to not just jump in front of a train and get it over with. I suck. I just fucking hate myself.

The only reason I am still here typing this useless post is because a) I have failed to kms previously and b) I find a bit of strength to keep going because of my dog.

Someone on an OLD app unprompted (I didn't message them) decided it would be really nice to message me and tell me I'm really ugly. So that happened. Made me feel even worse about my body and issues haha. Have lost myself in this illness yet again.

Does anyone else get periods of just being an absolute ghost in your own body? I feel trapped but wakeful at the same time. Can't sleep, my appetite is either insane or non-existent, constant mental pain in my head and chest. I've had this for 10 yrs now and it has taken everything from me. My physical and mental health, my body, my friendships. My happiness and my passion and my drive. All gone. I feel so close to the end and I have felt this close two times before and both were significant sustained periods of intense low mood and pain and grief. I know that it will improve eventually, but every single time it wears me down closer to the bone and I am scared that one day it will happen again and I won't have the strength to come back from this. Or the people around me to help me step back from that fine line. 

I feel like I can't say any of this to anyone close to me. I wish I could, I love them all so so so much, but I don't feel that they would respond well to this or be up to it. It is an insanely difficult period for everyone involved. I wish this meant something. That this suffering wasn't for nothing, but it is. It's senseless suffering for no reason. And for me it makes it so much harder. I hope that people out there can fight their battles and win, I hope that I can too.

I am stuck for positives right now, but I think it's my nature to try to find them, and I guess one is that it gives contrast to moments that are good, and helps me appreciate truely what I want and what I value. Even so, this illness is a living hell, and I pray that nobody I care for ever has to live this life like this. Its so lonely, painful and just frankly sad. I try to be a positive happy person whenever I can, and appreciate those moments, but the older I get the harder it has been to look beyond towards the future. How can you even begin to plan  a future when you have no idea if you'll even get the opportunity to have one? 

I wish I knew that my friends and family did care for me, and that they truely know that they are the only thing keeping me here. I am thankful to have these things, they have given me so much strength to fight, but I am so tired and want to rest now. I don't know what to do anymore.

I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m a toxic person to be around, but I don&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;m just starting to think that it&amp;#39;s a good idea to stop talking to people. I&amp;#39;m only able to speak to people online, but it seems rather useless to me now. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that I feel lonely all the time, and I get jealous of people who find it easy to make friends and keep them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why I&amp;#39;m making a post, I guess I just needed to get these feelings out, I doubt anyone would read this really.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi,

I (F, 29) love nature. All I ever wanted was a home in the countryside, waking up to feeding my horse, work and then getting lost in the woods with him.

While I could reorganise my life to be able to work from home, as much as I struggle with human interaction, I also struggle with loneliness sometimes.

My family is broken and very toxic so I don’t want to be near them.

I am scared of moving to the countryside, buying a house there, and then figuring out it is too much for me.

I am losing so much money renting as opposed to buying a home for my future.

I have severe depression, I want to die on most days, which is not helping with clarity and decision making.

Any thoughts?

,depression,"
(Senior in HS)
     
     So i’ll start this off by saying i don’t remember most of my childhood. 

     I think i have a lot of issues, I remember getting crazy good grades in early elementary school (All A’s in 3rd even) but i specifically remember always hating it. I had a shit teacher or two and i generally didn’t like it. This has only gotten worse over the years. Of course, middle school was even worse. I straight up don’t even remember hardly any of grades 6 - 8 apart from band class. 

     Then I started high school. Honestly i don’t even remember a lot of that either mainly because it was so boring. I almost failed 2 or 3 times. I have no idea what i’m doing. I almost failed Spanish last year just barely getting a C or D with my moms help. I got her help the last couple of times also. 

     Let me talk about my parents for a second. They’re kind to me most of the time, but they’re a little strange. Firstly, as a teenager, they seem kind of unfocused when it comes to me.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; So i’ll start this off by saying i don’t remember most of my childhood. 

 I think i have a lot of issues, I remember getting crazy good grades in early elementary school (All A’s in 3rd even) but i specifically remember always hating it. I had a shit teacher or two and i generally didn’t like it. This has only gotten worse over the years. Of course, middle school was even worse. I straight up don’t even remember hardly any of grades 6 - 8 apart from band class. 

 Then I started high school. Honestly i don’t even remember a lot of that either mainly because it was so boring. I almost failed 2 or 3 times. I have no idea what i’m doing. I almost failed Spanish last year just barely getting a C or D with my moms help. I got her help the last couple of times also. 

 Let me talk about my parents for a second. They’re kind to me most of the time, but they’re a little strange. Firstly, as a teenager, they seem kind of unfocused when it comes to me. Not neglecting but just a little absent. Also my mom can get stressed sometimes and my dad gets stressed if anything is even slightly wrong with my mom and in general can be a little touchy. I’ve grown to be repulsed at the idea of talking to them about this. Mainly from an incident of me talking to them about possibly being autistic/adhd and them shutting it down immediately, and from me becoming a bit cynical from all of this.

,depression,"When I was in my early twenties I attempted to kill myself. Before that I struggled with depression but it had gone largely undiagnosed for most of my early life. My mother died when I was young and my father was physically abusive and would not let my wellbeing be a priority. I performed well in academics and with a scholarship and 2 years active duty in the military I paid my way to go to a prestigious college. Unfortunately my depression rapidly got worse after I began. That winter I attempted to kill myself and was luckily noticed by security at the hotel in which I was attempting to do so. I then spent time in an inpatient facility in which I was formally diagnosed with depression and treated with an SSRI and went through several outpatient programs.  


For some, I think that is where the story ends, but not for me; my depression got worse and worse. I exercised daily, meditated regularly, ate a healthy balanced diet, went to therapy regularly and went through more prescriptions than I can count. I was put on multiple SSRI's, an SNRI, a tricyclic, an MAOI and I tried mood stabilizers (valproic acid is *the worst*), anti-psychotics, and Wellbutrin along side my anti depressants. Nothing worked and my anhedonia got so bad that I lost all interest in sex, food, and, well, pretty much everything. I wouldn't eat or sleep for days and I couldn't keep my job. Down more than fifty pounds and on the verge of being evicted from my apartment, I desperately looked for alternatives. I found a way to try ketamine infusions, psilocybin, and rTCMS. None of it worked. At the behest of a fellow doctor, my psychiatrist put me on Vyvanse.  


I didn't expect it to be any different but it was. It was a stimulant and that helped me get out of bed, but more than that there was also a disconnected effect that I noticed even when I was off of it. I had less anxiety and for once in a long time I could *feel* things. I could laugh, I could cry, I could have sex with a pretty girl and enjoy it; my life suddenly had color again. I started working on things that I had a passion for long ago and those passions took off. My passion turned into a job and that job into a career. I met friends and grew close to people. I met the love of my life and moved in with her. I was on the drug for 7 years and my life had turned around. I still had to battle my depression, but it was manageable.  


When mental health professionals learned that I was on vyvanse I would suddenly notice a change in tone, however. ""We are taught not to give stimulants for depression"" they would tell me and they'd say ""you should be careful about becoming dependent."" But those worries weren't consistent with my experience. The SSRI that I took with it had worse withdrawal symptoms and often I would forget to take the vyvanse for several days. It was when I was struggling that it helped and I never felt the need to take more than the low dose that I did take (the lowest available dose).  


Recently my prescribing doctor had fallen ill and became unavailable with no one to cover (due to covid) and for the first time in many years I approached other doctors to obtain my prescriptions. As a result, I have basically had to go cold turkey from all my active medications. Even when I was just asking for the lexapro (which really fucks me up with withdrawal), the fact that I even mentioned vyvanse would cause hesitancy. One psychiatric nurse, without asking about my mood, well being, or history simply stated that I shouldn't be ""trying to get speed from doctors and should consider rehab."" When another doctor suggested several medications that I had already been on with no benefit (cymbalta and then nardil) and I expressed reservations, he pushed back and said that my lack of openness was a sign of drug seeking behavior.  


The experience of constantly being told that the one thing that has worked for me makes me a drug addict has put me back into that place I was seven years ago. I feel like I am alone again in that apartment helpless to this illness which is once again consuming my life. I have been off vyvanse for 3 months now and I can no longer have sex with my girlfriend. I struggle to feel anything when she tells me that she loves me or when I see the smile of my niece. I have no interest in my passions again and my chess set and laptop have begun getting dusty. Once again, I am going through a bunch of crazy medications which are doing everything but helping. I feel like I've been run through a sham. I feel like the big difference between back then and now is only that now my depression impacts and hurts those that have come to depend on me.  


I am now desperate again. I have obtained ketamine and adderall and tried both and neither have helped. I am considering going off of my anti depressant to try psilocybin and am starting to look for places that offer ECT and rTCMS out of the country. Increasingly what I have discovered and the source of a lot of my frustration is that my interactions with the psychiatric community have grown to be somewhat toxic. I genuinely do not feel like my current psychiatrist wants to help me (he doesn't seem one bit alarmed when I inform him of my increased suicidal ideation and simply wants to cycle through SNRIs, tricyclics, and MAOIs regardless of their impact), and I've been called a drug addict by more than one mental health practitioner.  


What is most alarming, however, is that in conversations with others that have drug resistant depression, I have found a similar theme. I have met, at this stages, at least a dozen people who had to turn their entire life upside down and/or do something illegal and dangerous just to get treatment that worked for them. I have met folks who cannot afford ECT and rTCMS and cannot function without it (both with and without psychotic symptoms). I have met several people who have been forced to grow or buy their own medication illegally (and at least one person who had legal trouble as a result). I have met others who have the same experience with vyvanse (many of which have faked ADHD in order to obtain it). Why in this day and age, are there so many of us that have to operate outside of the system which exists to help us *in order to get help*?  


TLDR: I was taken off the medication that worked for 7 years, called a drug addict, and now am struggling to fight my depression.

the thing is at this point of life I haven't been working for like a month, basically I leaved my dead end shit job to pursue a content creation online, that so far goes terribly wrong, due to the fact that I can't choose what to make content about, basically I overthink things too much and also the fact that I feel passionless about a topic doesn't make it any easier.

Also the only person I've been talking to every night and only by phone is my mom, right now im living in another country so there's that too, I've been 2 years away from home. which they didn't feel that lonely because in my past job I talked to some coworkers so that made it more bearable.

 I workout everyday, running plus resistance exercises, I guess that's what's keeping me from loosing my mind, and although sometimes it feels like a waste of time, im not planning on stopping that. also I don't smoke, don't drink not drugs, im pretty boring I know XD.

the point is I don't feel like happy at this moment, and I frankly I don't know if I ever will, actually I feel pretty useless, im 35 right know feeling lonely af and like a failure as well

I wanted to post this I don't know why, maybe looking for comfort words or something, although it feels kind of relieving writing this. if you take your time to read this thank you so much.  
any comment would be really appreciated it.

,depression,"I'm a 20 yo male from egypt
In the past few years i've made myself the absolute parent wet dream
- i don't drink or smoke or go clubbing 
- studying to be a dentist and my GPA is 3.7
- i help with chores around the house ( cooking - cleaning)
- in good shape and healthy ( exercising and playing soccer once a week )
- in the summer break i don't get an allowance but rather work freelance or side hustles to get money to support my spending 
So due to financial circumstances my parents both work and there is always trouple when it comes to spending money ( such as college fees, books, holidays...etc)

My parents always make sure to let me know who spent the money and how exactly it is

How much does one owe the other 

And there are always back breaking comments when i make a mistake 

Gaslighting my feelings and accusing me of being selfish when saying i had enough of the fighting over money 

And due to the package i carry from home i try to be nice to everyone just to get them to love me or feel affection from someone but nothing is all i get ( or even resentment in sometimes )

So i hate this situation and the thought of death being a comfort didn't leave my mind for the past 2 month

&lt;p&gt;I have literally no one to turn to, and again, that&amp;#39;s my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of disappointing EVERYONE! 
Including myself..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days it really feels like I&amp;#39;ll never amount to anything. Like I&amp;#39;m just stuck, destined to be a fucking nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
So to put in context, I(25m)  a med student in my final year and I have just 2 exams to complete before I’m a doctor but the thing is, in my university we get to choose our exam dates and we get to change those dates however we wish. Lately I’ve been noticing myself being lazy and procrastinating, therefore I find myself unable to finish the subjects on time.
I’m supported financially by my parents, who are in a lot of debt and who put a lot of effort into getting me to where I am right now. I am hoping to see if anyone else is in a similar situation and I hope someone could give me an advice on how to be more productive ( I’ve tried put up schedules , group studies, white noise, timers...nothing works ). Atm I feel so overwhelmed that I have let down my parents (I have a total of 6 exams and thesis in my final year and I have completed everything except for the two exams left) because of me delaying my exam date, this has brought me to severe depression for the past two years( cz of my laziness I have basically extended my final year to a total of two years and probably will need 2 months extra) 
I was a believer in god a few years ago and I found that faith helped me face exams much better, but I don’t want to go back into religion at all.
I just want to get done with med school and start helping my parents out with paying their debts.

I don't feel sad, but I don't feel happy either. There are some videos or games that make me laugh or smile, but only for a bit, yet that's enough to make me feel like I'm faking it all.

,depression," Hello everyone who is reading this blog and I understand what you are going through so you came to read my blog I get it! I’m going through a phase  of breakup not just boyfriend but from my families and from friends everyone is breaking up with me making me feel worst about my self. Out of all of this I don’t have anyone to talk yeah I get that it’s very sad but really I don’t have anyone to even talk I stopped talking for a while and none of my family even realised. They put my food near my bed and go I eat when I’m hungry and if they need anything they will ask I just started to show them . If people are calling me I stopped picking up there phones and I’m texting them but they of course call for something they need after it’s done I never hear from them anyways so it’s fine. Only two people will talk to me right now it’s my brother if he is bored and want to use my phone and my grandmother who wants see if did brush my teeth to eat breakfast if im hungry to eat my lunch and if im hungry again for snack and for dinner that’s all I don’t have anyone to talk this why everyone says teenage sucks I just turn 20 just two months ago and nothing good is actually happening except for the worst. 

 I had a person whom I cared a lot about and now after all these years we are not together anymore and I don’t know what to do with my life because I made him an idol every time when ever he takes a decision I would follow it and go on with him now after he leaving me I don’t know what I have to do with my life. now I feel so empty without him I can’t take the stress while being with him and i have no idea what to do with my life anyone 

And coming to my family we are very orthodox family. I turned out to be the odd one out who stopped caring about god due to everything that’s happening around and my mom started to treat me like I’m the biggest sinner in the world and even looking at my face will give them sin (papam) 

My dad goes to work in the morning and comes back really late the only time I get to see him is just 2 hours in that time we eat dinner he has people coming to talk to him in so much more somedays I don’t even see his face even living the same house so I’d not mind about him. 

And coming to me being thin and depressed talking about it like a big joke in india if we don’t eat properly we become thin itseems I eat 4 times a day I eat food at midnight I eat snack all the time my mouth doesn’t stop until there is no more snacks in my house because I buy around 100$ (7000 rupees snacks ) every month so you should know how I eat and I never eat vegetables I always eat meat max 5 times a week I eat meat still everyone who sees me thinks I don’t eat food 

I’m depressed person too i stayed alone for a month in an apartment I cut my hands multiple times and cried every day for 5 to 6 hours a day and my eyes were always swollen so I took good medication and I’m fine now but I don’t think I’m fine anymore staying with 6 people in my house I still feel and I can’t sleep I have a huge void in my stomach and my heart it’s so bad 

About my education I will take time to write in a another blog so😂

Everything in my life is getting so much crazier that I used to have 100’S of friends now I’m just alone 

Life use to be so much easier than now it seems so much difficult that I don’t think I can ever move on with my life anymore 

Just keeping my head down and accepting everything that life is putting me through.

,depression,"I was wondering if any of you have any tips that help you deal with the dishes. 

I have depression, ptsd and high functioning anxiety. I can bring myself to pick up garbage and throw my laundry in the same mountain in the corner of my bedroom. I dont mind never folding clothes or making my bed. I've come to terms with the depression and anxiety and that this is how I live and get by and what works for me. 

Dishes dont work for me tho. They pile up. I use paper and plastic everything. Its much much more manageable for me to just toss the paper dishes and take out trash. 

BUT, currently, despite using paper (I ran out this month at some point) I used every single usable dish in my house apart from my large mixing bowls. I had some dishes I brought to work but I threw them away because buying a new dish is easier to me than washing them. 

Cant remember what its called, maybe an impossible task? It just feels too big to start and the thought of it makes my muscles tense up and I want to cry. Its frustrating because I can't just set a timer or watch someone else clean to help myself. 

I also dont have a dishwasher...

The ONLY thing I have found that helps me feel better is dedicating a drying rack jut for dirty dishes so I can keep my sinks empty. Makes me feel so so so much better. Still dont do the dishes, but for anxiety and depression, it does great things. 

I am to the point where I almost want to just hire someone to do them. nothing else. Just do my dishes.

,depression,"Something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember is struggling with paying attention to things and concentration. I mean I will by trying my hardest to listen to someone, but then realise I've zoned out mid sentence and haven't paid attention to anything they've said. I cannot concentrate on tasks at all, I get distracted by anything or something literally nothing, I end up starting loads of tasks at once and struggle to finish any of them no matter how simple.

I also really struggle with restlessness and patience. I am always moving, it's physically impossible for me to sit still for more than a moment. All this mixed with the fact I seem to have no short term memory and really struggle to get myself motivated to do any task is making my life difficult.

All this started to make me think this was ADHD, I fit the profile perfectly and my brain has been like this since I can remember, before I ever started to consider I had depression and anxiety.  However I spoke to my doctor today and she says it's side effects of the anxiety as I didn't particularly misbehave as a child. She's recommended I start therapy again, which I'm going to start since this negatively effecting my life, and now I think about it has negatively effected me a lot through my life.

,depression,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

Hi there everyone. I have reached a situation I don't know how to handle any further.

Some context I am male, 32 years old, live in germany, depressed for many years now with anxiety disorder and social phobia (all diagnosed). I am gay, HIV positive (in treatment) and was always the strange kid everywhere. I also suspect to have ADHD which would explain some of my rather subpar social abilities and me jumping between topics from time to time (sorry if my post gets inconsistent for you)

I visited a psychotherapist 4 years ago for about half a year to try and get me back on track. This didn't help much and the meds I got just made no difference or they made the situation worse even after weeks of taking them. 

After my therapy was ""done"" I drifted a bit not doing much all day. I eventually entered a retraining program to become a tax clerk because it was recommended for me because of my abilities. I successfully ended the retraining and am now an official tax clerk (on paper). This was 5 months ago.

While in the internship part of the retraining I noticed that I am not only scared around/of other people or afraid to look like a fool in front of others, I downright hated it being with people I didn't know much but could tell that they took me for an idiot. It's the way they talk and treat you which makes it obvious and makes me stress even more. They did not burst out or screamed at me when I made mistakes, they just treated me like a toddler with pity in their words. I know I am not perfect and do many small mistakes so they are right to be disappointed. 

This also showed at the final verbal exam for becoming a tax clerk. I was really nervous and when I got my exam topic I managed to focus a bit and collected some key points in the 10 minutes we got to prepare. But when I stood in front of the committee  I just locked up. I managed to spew some words that made a logic sentence which saved me from failing right at the finish line. I could tell the committee was disappointed considering I had some of the best theoretical results of the 50 people they tested that year and they also told me with pity in their words to maybe reconsider my career. I guess you can tell this was the point I just didn't know what to do anymore. I felt, and still do like I am not fitting anywhere.

To add to this I was never good in small talk and always preferred to be by myself so not much of a charmer. I can cooperate with other people and are the last one to get mad at someone. But the more I payed attention to others around me the more I longed to be left alone, the more I hated being with people that are probably just wearing masks telling you you do ok while gossiping behind your back to an extend it would make you cry.

I also became pretty bitter over the past few years and honestly can't find a reason to try to get back into society. I am just tired of people. However after 5 months of no income I reached the limit and as it looks I wont be able to pay for my health insurance this month (15th/16th). I still have meds to treat my HIV infection for a few months but if I get sick because of something else there is a good chance I have to carry the costs with an empty bank account.

I know I can get a job with my qualifications but I also know I won't last long because I will focus too much on other people cues again, losing the will to do anything just being at 100% stress the moment I wake up from my alarm until the end of the shift. But I also know that I am a burden to my family right now.

I talked to my family doctor about getting evaluated from a psychotherapist (maybe the same I was at 4 years ago) for ADHD. I was met with hesitation but I guess in this rural region I live in I am a very rare case. I also talked to my doctor that is responsible for my HIV treatment about my situation because I let slip that I feel PHYSICALLY ok and he kept asking. He proposed that he could get me a appointment in the psychiatric ward of the hospital because he was close with another doctor that worked there.I declined because I didn't wanted to trouble him (knowing fully well I fuck this up too in some way) and I am also scared of the stationary aspect.

I guess that is the Story so far. Now I might condense the point of this Post to one or two direct questions:

,depression,"
I geniunly don’t know what to do with my life anymore.
I’ve thought of everything I’ve been able to - vanlife, tiny houses, unit sharing, part-times, working now (i tried but scored a fast food one, lasted a month, then parents shut the search down as “i was clearly a failure” so yeah) and unfortunately, there’s just so far i can get with physical (cerebral palsy) and mental (ADHD, OCD, Bipolar, suspected Aspergers; BPD, anger issues) disorders, not to mention the same narcissistic, abusive + manipulative helicopter parents (it’s mostly mental abuse now but was physical in the past) and other bullying and all…i haven’t had a sound sleep since age 8 and haven’t been able to go outside without a physical tracker i can’t rid of, govt. services can’t help // get manipulated, all that good shit there…not to even mention the 5 year long anxiety period when I was 9-14 that my parents refused to help me with.

That brings me to now. Been essentially a shut-in and isolated (even at school) at all times at 16 years old, and fearing for any future in this country, due to the fact I cannot afford it and I just can’t stand my diminishing rights. I’ve tried every way to get out, including physically, but that just fails everytime. My friends (that saved me from suicide 7 times) got blocked in Sept. due to “suspicious activity” and I’ve been banned from most socials and lost everyone as a result…not to mention physical deaths.

But I want to talk about a less distant crisis. Lately I have been losing interest in everything. Lately I’ve been struggling to brush my teeth. My severe depression has arrived right on time, and with school around the corner, I’m anxious, nervous and afraid of what is ahead for me. And, my depression has arrived a couple months early. With that comes the tiredness, comes the laziness, comes the oversleeping, comes the fogginess, comes the lack of interest, comes the inability to do chores, comes the no money, comes the no way out of here, comes the fatigue, comes the disconnection from friends, comes the worsening, comes the violence of dreams, comes the school failing, comes the isolation, comes greater familial ignorance, comes the lack of activity, comes the drop in intelligence, comes the unavailability of jobs, comes the worsening of pay, comes the lower intake of food, comes the dangerous anorexia,  comes the hopelessness of my situation, comes the suicide ideation, comes the ignorance, comes the preoccupation with death, and then finally comes The Note within 8 short months.

(I’m living with Ben Shapiro and mega-TERF Mother Gothel. I HATE to bring politics into this but when it comes down to them attacking me day after day for simply existing, then it unfortunately rears its ugly head.)

My grades are slipping further, my home life has worsened (there are fights every day), and any hope for getting out of this country has left the station. I’m broke and will continue to be. I’m just barely holding on, but I’ve noticed a sharper increase in dreams related to death. I have more violent thoughts and urges, and i’m increasingly scared of being around other people. My paranoia has only worsened the amount of panic attacks I get. It gets so bad sometimes I can’t even talk. I have gotten a lot more socially anxious and isolated, in record time too.

I don’t even know if I have a future. I’m pretty sure my (financially) abusive mother, whose birthday is tommorow (yaaay) ruined and mucked it all up for me. A “dream” scenario is honestly, just living in a apartment, maybe less than 250 sqft in a lively city (philly, nyc, portland, whatever), but honestly i’ve just accepted not only will i most likely be forced to be homeless (unless there’s some miracle rent i can score for sub-500$), but i have also accepted the fact that there’s a 90% chance of me not getting out of the USA, 5% chance that i end up some miraculously in Canada, and the remaining 5% goes to, fuck knows, Eastern Europe??? Either way, it don’t look fine in the least for me or any future prospects.

Social anxiety prevents customer service jobs, I’m too stupid and dumb for a mechanical or physically intense job, and some fuck other who knows bullshit excuse to justify almost being on the verge of not being able to work, wich in america, means i end up starving one way or another in any circumstance. I’m just too fucking stupid, not to mention dangerous behind the wheel of a car. I have literally **zero redeemable qualities**, and the immense gaslighting my mother pulls make it somehow negative redeemable qualities.

I’m extremly fucked up and fucked in life, and I’ve known this for a while now, regardless of how I feel about it. There comes a point in time where to you just cannot improve your situation, and for me, my depression just sinks lower and lower. My once-a-month therapist wishes she could help, but with a dead-end future, I ain’t getting nowhere in life, at least from the looks of it. Even in the slim chance I get on SSI, that won’t afford me jack shit. I’ve just got to face it, I’m stuck in this situation because of a lot of factors I cannot control.  I want to comfort in my misery, in my depression, but I want to be somewhere where I can control my environment to make changes necessary. But, right now, I can’t. And it seems only, to be getting worse and worse every. single. passing. week. Add that on top of a pattern of continuous toxic “friendships” that more often than not left me with no constant people in my life other than my family, wich, needless to say, never helped me much else either. nothing is holding me back from getting more anxious, hostile, and violent. i can’t leave maximum security that is my house, but i can’t stay, otherwise i will be driven to suicide ideation like nothing else i’ve expierienced before. the government can’t do shit, my therapist can’t do shit, my familt can’t do shit, my friends (what i have left) can’t do shit, reddit can’t do shit, and i can’t do shit. because i’m so afraid of getting caught and dragged back, like last time, and the time before that. but what can i do when i’m the family jester and the funnyman, and the day labourer whenever they can use me, else they’ll just ignore.

I’m just too fucking stupid, not to mention dangerous behind the wheel of a car. I have literally &lt;strong&gt;zero redeemable qualities&lt;/strong&gt;, and the immense gaslighting my mother pulls make it somehow negative redeemable qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m extremly fucked up and fucked in life, and I’ve known this for a while now, regardless of how I feel about it. There comes a point in time where to you just cannot improve your situation, and for me, my depression just sinks lower and lower. My once-a-month therapist wishes she could help, but with a dead-end future, I ain’t getting nowhere in life, at least from the looks of it. Even in the slim chance I get on SSI, that won’t afford me jack shit. I’ve just got to face it, I’m stuck in this situation because of a lot of factors I cannot control.  I want to comfort in my misery, in my depression, but I want to be somewhere where I can control my environment to make changes necessary. But, right now, I can’t. And it seems only, to be getting worse and worse every. single. passing. week. Add that on top of a pattern of continuous toxic “friendships” that more often than not left me with no constant people in my life other than my family, wich, needless to say, never helped me much else either. nothing is holding me back from getting more anxious, hostile, and violent. i can’t leave maximum security that is my house, but i can’t stay, otherwise i will be driven to suicide ideation like nothing else i’ve expierienced before. the government can’t do shit, my therapist can’t do shit, my familt can’t do shit, my friends (what i have left) can’t do shit, reddit can’t do shit, and i can’t do shit. because i’m so afraid of getting caught and dragged back, like last time, and the time before that. but what can i do when i’m the family jester and the funnyman, and the day labourer whenever they can use me, else they’ll just ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve saved myself 7 times from suicide, I’m trying everything to not make it an 8th, but it’s proving extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’ve had a few types of therapy for depression over the years (about 15), including a few rounds of CBT. 

One therapist I had spoke about herself for long portions of our sessions. One was a student and I think a bit overwhelmed at the time. One time I had 10 sessions where the therapist said nothing; I’d simply sit in the room with them and cry for 50 minutes, then repeat the next week. Recently I tried hypnotherapy and on our 4th session the hypnotherapist said she couldn’t help me because my hopeless world view was too strong. 

One time I “shopped” for a therapist who I’d get along with well — by having lots of intro sessions with different therapists and picking the one I liked the most. After about 15 sessions it was clear we weren’t making any kind of progress. 

It’s hard not to see that I must be the problem in at least a couple of these cases but I don’t know what else to do. If they give me homework I do it. Everything they ask me to do in the sessions, I do it. Visualisations, gratitude journaling, regular exercise etc. The main thing that could be a problem is that sometimes I doubt that they can help me.

,depression,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title explained, my partner (who I'm in a long-distance relationship with, they're in the UK, I'm in the US), suffers from severe Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder. We got together in Spring and he's warned me for the last couple months that this was coming up. I've always promised him that I'm not going anywhere and that I can handle it, and I haven't had any trouble with these promises.  


However, he's been sick (we're not sure what with) for the last week and a half and it's setting off his Depression really bad which is understandable. What's troublesome is that he's shared that he's worried he won't be able to shake it before September hits and his S.A.D. starts to kick into overdrive for the next 7-or-so months. He's suffered from these conditions throughout his entire life and I've known him for some time before we started our relationship though never this intimately (he'd disappear for long stretches of time, now I know why), so I've no reason to doubt that his concerns are valid.  


My question to you all is fairly simple... What should I do? How can I help and be there for him? He gets agitated if I ask him how he's feeling too often, especially if I pry for details (not because he's hiding anything, he just starts feeling like he's at a doctor's or being interrogated by a psychiatrist, which I get 100%), and if I ask him what I can do to help he changes the subject and ignores the question or he tells me that I am helping by doing whatever I happened to be doing at the time (lately it's gaming together or watching movies). I know I should rely on his word but he's flat out told me that he's not comfortable asking for help and when he's down like this he doesn't even feel like he's worthy of help or any type of positivity..  


So yeah, any advice on how to possibly help him feel more at ease during his darker times would be appreciated. I really care about him so I'd appreciate advice that is productive to the relationship's longevity, please.

They need to figure out life but they have a lot of good going for them and I know if I&amp;#39;m in their life I&amp;#39;ll fuck it up. Anytime I&amp;#39;m in their life it tends to go south for them. Just like this time when they spoke to me, their life fell apart right when we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s better if I don&amp;#39;t exist so I can&amp;#39;t hurt anyone anymore. I only seen to be a burden on people&amp;#39;s lives. I&amp;#39;m.tired of being so pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I feel completely hopeless. I remember being a sober, promising new talent. Everyone was behind me and I felt invincible. Then I went through shit that no person should ever have to, and then started to recall things that happened to me as a kid, and then started to be seriously affected by those experiences and developed ptsd pretty bad. I still can't be around fireworks, and backfires set me off. I wound up starting a career path that I had wanted since I was a kid and it means nothing to me now. I'm a functional drug addict and I'm stuck working 12 hour shifts at my lab, then I go work another 4 programming a lims system for my lab which I may or may not even be paid for. Any free time I get, I'm either *not doing illegal shit* or using what came of that to escape reality. I'm working my life away, I'm haunted by people I care, and I nearly being murdered, and then having to go on to be the fixer to save everyone. As soon as everyone was safe and the situation was settled, most of my friends were gone. I travelled to see what I learned were distant Qanon crazed family members. They accused me of being some drug lord and forcibly hospitalized me after being invited to simply come over to visit. They said they were helping me get away from my family who they more or less described as the sopranos. While hospitalized, I was stripped by cops in front of a crowded waiting room, locked away and when I asked for anxiety medication to take the edge off while they were attempting to find a legal reason to hold me, they gave me an anti-psychotic. That combined with my ADD dropped my dopamine levels to essentially 0. I for the first time in my life honestly felt suicidal the minute it kicked in. I sat locked in a solitary confinement cell in a psych ward for 10 hours listening to the sounds of violent mentally ill people screaming things like how as soon as the door was opened she'd cut our heads off and rip our intestines out. Eventually when they concluded my health was fine, I had no drugs in my system, was not mentally ill, and I had zero risk of suicide they begrudgingly let me go onto the street of a town I didn't know 100 miles from home. Thankfully my ""mafia"" family had heard of what happened and were already in town to bring me home. They all have there own problems though so there weren't many chances to speak of my experience outside of what was said, how audacious the betrayal was, and trying to sort out if they were going to lie to police and attempt to get out house raided by cops. To this day I've only ever even spoke of this to like 1 person who was in no position to be supportive. I got out of *Not illegal activities* and continued chasing my dreams of becoming a scientific researcher, but was yet again cut down when I had to get someone I cared about off drugs before they self-destructed. Months later, holding down my first lab job and saving her, I was let go after being abused on the job. They threatened to fire me for obscure, unexplainable reasons so I took notes on exactly what I did throughout the day. When they tried to fire me for not doing enough, they then shifted to it being about me ""wasting time taking notes"" while he tried to hold back a guilty grin. It was the day before all these extravagant benefits he promised would have kicked in too. I was pushed back into selling *baked goods* and quickly started consuming as well. After many months of learning to program and nearly giving up on my career dreams, I finally got a break at new lab. A few months into that and things with my girl get worse and worse until she ultimately attempted to poison herself and jumped off a bridge. She was in a coma for a few days, but thankfully woke up. Now I sit here, high on, well tbh I couldn't realistically tell you what drugs are in my system because I just reach for it like someone would reach for a coffee as long as im not on the job. I've been priced out of my entire state. I'm probably going to have to leave my family and go who knows where. I might have to go back to *not illegal activities* to simply afford to live in poverty. I've already lost a lot of weight from starvation. My girl's sister said I looked like a POW. Honestly I feel completely hopeless. I don't want to be sober because all it is anymore is pain. Physical pain from 16 hour work days, and mental pain from running into everyone elses burning buildings to save them, while going home to my own burning building.

,depression,"This happened years ago but it sticks with me and it still plays in my head in the most vivid detail.

The years was 2007 and I was 18 years old living in a small rural town. I had just gotten off work just before 11pm. I was headed to a friends house who was having a party. I decided to take some backroads just so I could relax and unwind bit before I got there. One of the roads I took was infamous for speeding because it has many steep hills, known by some as “Rollercoaster Road.” It’s a typical country road with no yellow lines and just barely wide enough to accommodate two cars going in opposite directions.

I was on that road for 15 seconds before I noticed a strange orange glow illuminating the night sky. When I came up to the top of the hill I was on, I saw a small car completely engulfed in flames sideways blocking the road. I parked on the roadside about 60ft from the car. I stepped out and was immediately hit with an extreme heat. In movies, people could be close to something like that. I learned what Hollywood magic was in that moment. I called 911 and got out to see if anyone needed help.

While outside of my vehicle, I could hear screams. The likes of which I haven’t heard before or since. Nobody knows what there reactions will be in any situation. I took an opened bottle of water, doused myself and ran towards the car, as I got closer I began to hear the screams from the opposite side. Inside the car, there were two occupants. Obviously deceased. I made my way around the car. On the other side is where I saw an early 90’s f250 slid off the road in a barbed wire fence. Numerous people injured. Two other occupants from the car that had made it out. I knew them. They were injured, but not life threatening. I learned the truck was traveling the opposite direction as the car. The car was speeding down the road. Went off the pavement, over corrected, slid sideways and was T-Boned by the truck. I heard a woman screaming she couldn’t find her kids. They were in the bed of the truck before the accident. The kids were thrown from the truck and had landed quite far away in the grass on the roadside. Lifeless little bodies. 

Emergency vehicles began swarming. I ran back to the guy I knew. He kept trying to crawl to the car. Screaming the other occupants names. I had to help the paramedics hold him and calm him while they gave him meds to make him less resistant. 

Soon thereafter, a tow truck operator showed up. A close friend of mine’s father. I waited with him for the fire to be put out. Once it was safe to approach the vehicle, I went with him. Not really thinking, just telling what I’d seen and knew about this accident to this point. Once by the car, you could see the remains. The horrid smell of burnt fuel and human flesh. A sight that’s seared into my eyes as well as my memory. 

I left. Went home. No party for me. I took something to help me sleep and woke up the next day. I had texts from many friends informing me that one of my best friends little brothers was killed in an accident last night after leaving a party on a beer run. Naive me thought that there were just a lot of accidents that night. No. Only one. The charred remains of the front passenger that I saw belonged to my friend. I didn’t even know it. I’m thankful for that.

Other people my age learned I was there. Everyone had a hundred questions about it. I couldn’t sleep for weeks. The sounds of a mother panicking over her children, the screams of a friend that just watched our mutual friends burn, the smells that can’t be forgotten. I tried talking to my guy friends but when real emotions began to show, I got the “be a man” stuff. Female friends were even less help. Feeling alone, isolated, guilt over not being able to help the kids stacked up and I purposely od’d. It’s a miracle I’m alive today. A lifelong female friend came by to check on me randomly and called 911 when I didn’t answer my phone or door.

&lt;p&gt;The years was 2007 and I was 18 years old living in a small rural town. I had just gotten off work just before 11pm. I was headed to a friends house who was having a party. I decided to take some backroads just so I could relax and unwind bit before I got there. One of the roads I took was infamous for speeding because it has many steep hills, known by some as “Rollercoaster Road.” It’s a typical country road with no yellow lines and just barely wide enough to accommodate two cars going in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on that road for 15 seconds before I noticed a strange orange glow illuminating the night sky. When I came up to the top of the hill I was on, I saw a small car completely engulfed in flames sideways blocking the road. I parked on the roadside about 60ft from the car. I stepped out and was immediately hit with an extreme heat. In movies, people could be close to something like that. I learned what Hollywood magic was in that moment. I called 911 and got out to see if anyone needed help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While outside of my vehicle, I could hear screams. The likes of which I haven’t heard before or since. Nobody knows what there reactions will be in any situation. I took an opened bottle of water, doused myself and ran towards the car, as I got closer I began to hear the screams from the opposite side. Inside the car, there were two occupants. Obviously deceased. I made my way around the car. On the other side is where I saw an early 90’s f250 slid off the road in a barbed wire fence. Numerous people injured. Two other occupants from the car that had made it out. I knew them. They were injured, but not life threatening. I learned the truck was traveling the opposite direction as the car. The car was speeding down the road. Went off the pavement, over corrected, slid sideways and was T-Boned by the truck. I heard a woman screaming she couldn’t find her kids. They were in the bed of the truck before the accident. The kids were thrown from the truck and had landed quite far away in the grass on the roadside. Lifeless little bodies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emergency vehicles began swarming. I ran back to the guy I knew. He kept trying to crawl to the car. Screaming the other occupants names. I had to help the paramedics hold him and calm him while they gave him meds to make him less resistant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon thereafter, a tow truck operator showed up. A close friend of mine’s father. I waited with him for the fire to be put out. Once it was safe to approach the vehicle, I went with him. Not really thinking, just telling what I’d seen and knew about this accident to this point. Once by the car, you could see the remains. The horrid smell of burnt fuel and human flesh. A sight that’s seared into my eyes as well as my memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left. Went home. No party for me. I took something to help me sleep and woke up the next day. I had texts from many friends informing me that one of my best friends little brothers was killed in an accident last night after leaving a party on a beer run. Naive me thought that there were just a lot of accidents that night. No. Only one. The charred remains of the front passenger that I saw belonged to my friend. I didn’t even know it. I’m thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people my age learned I was there. Everyone had a hundred questions about it. I couldn’t sleep for weeks. The sounds of a mother panicking over her children, the screams of a friend that just watched our mutual friends burn, the smells that can’t be forgotten. I tried talking to my guy friends but when real emotions began to show, I got the “be a man” stuff. Female friends were even less help. Feeling alone, isolated, guilt over not being able to help the kids stacked up and I purposely od’d. It’s a miracle I’m alive today. A lifelong female friend came by to check on me randomly and called 911 when I didn’t answer my phone or door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life changed that night as did many others. I’m still here and battle the depression daily.&lt;/p&gt;

She even messages my girlfriend from time to time. Now my GF and I are taking a break, so we both can work on ourselves. This month has been tough with one bad thing happening after another. I&amp;#39;m in therapy now, and talked to a psychologist for his opinion on better med options and boosters. The thing that shocks me is that he said I&amp;#39;m on the cusp of developing borderline personality disorder. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I&amp;#39;m sticking with these things but I feel too far gone. I can&amp;#39;t stop worrying and being the most unhappy I&amp;#39;ve ever been. I have lost all my appetite, and just can&amp;#39;t talk to anyone because I&amp;#39;m tired of leaning on people, and tired of just being told to move on. I&amp;#39;m in a place where I want to disappear for a few days. I bought what I need to live and work in my car, I just want to drive far away and sleep in my car and tell no one, then just come back early next week. I feel like I need to do this, but I know it&amp;#39;s not me saying that. What should I do, or what can help me?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey

I feel like I need to speak up and lift the heaviness of my thoughts off my shoulders. 

I am 22, living in a Caucasian country with strict requirements from males; they must be strong, don't show emotions, and be true leaders. If they see even the smallest sign of mistreatment, they must fight immediately. Well, I don't fit in this category. I don't have an experience of such things. A calm person by nature, I would rather talk things out than fight over them. 

My father has never supported me in any way. We live in the same house, but we never speak to each other. I basically have no support except for my mother and sister. In recent weeks, the thought of me as an adult has crept into my head: I need to take responsibility for my family, I need to protect my sister; I need to behave more mature and more like a real man. However, no one showed me how to do that. I've never been in a fight and am unsure if I will be able to protect my closest ones if needed. I always escape from taking on any sort of responsibilities because I am sure that I'll fail them. And the meeting of these 2 thoughts of me being an adult and not knowing how to behave properly make me really depressed. It's already a week that every time I try to do something, the thought of me being helpless and sort of a loser doesn't let me finish anything.

I also have very severe social anxiety on top of this, so I feel like I am letting my family down by not being a good support system for them. I feel like a real failure.

I just really need a male role model in my life to rely on, but there is no one. My father is not interested in our family, and I have no brothers. Only friends with whom I  will feel very ashamed to talk about this.

I was always aware of the type of my personality, but I don't know why my mind focused on my disadvantages for the past week literally non-stop.

I can&amp;#39;t even get up to go outside anymore outside of a few instances and its starting to affect my job now too as i find myself just too depressed and outright crying sometimes but I don&amp;#39;t wanna die i just want to get relief. everything i use to do that brought joy is just dull to me. every day passes and i spend half my free time just going through my gallery looking at the one and only thing that ever brought me pride and joy and now ill never see my kid again, i try talking to people online just to suppress the feeling but theres always a point and time where nobody&amp;#39;s there and im left alone with my thought&amp;#39;s again. i..just dont know what to do anymore&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"We are foster parents. We just received a placement two weeks ago for two sisters 11 and 15. The 11-year-old is really struggling hard. Obviously, any reason why a kid would end up in foster care is sad and terrible. Situational depression is very common and I'm used to dealing with very sad kids. 

However, last night, in tears she started opening up about feeling sad all the time. And as she cried and talked, I realized that we were probably dealing with something else besides situational depression. She described being sad, even when good things are happening. She talked about how at school, she is always anxious and hates being in groups. Sometimes she will go cry in the bathroom and gets bullied on the regular. It also seems like, because she is so emotional, the teachers don't take her very seriously and disregard her when she feels bullied. And she mentioned having felt suicidal in the past, but that she liked being alive, she just hates feeling so sad all the time. ""What is wrong with me?"" she asked through more teas. ""Why can't I ever feel happy?"" There are also additional trauma-related issues that we are seeing that are concerning as well.

The soonest appointment I can get for this kid is August 17 and it's just a preliminary visit to set up mental health services. I've already been warned that the wait for a therapist is months away. What do I do in the meantime? How do I help? I'm really good at advocating for my foster kids so I'm wondering if I need to push harder to get her therapy sooner.

I’ve been through therapy and still occasionally go when I need it. I learned to manage my depression well but when I get triggered, stressed out or just out of nowhere, I still have very depressive phases.

Then he texted me, that I just have to choose to be happy and have to make the right decisions in life.

Honestly that kind of offended me. I didn’t choose to be depressed, it’s an illness! I can’t choose to be happy when depression strikes me down.

So I answered that that’s kind of offensive and is one of the absolute no gos when talking to someone with depression.

Not that my classmates don't like me as some have tried to show sympathy to me but after many of my mental breakdowns and holding of the tears out of fear that I would be called ""weak, foolish, retarded"", I have reached the point of no return and no escape from the darkness.

I was not bullied in elementary school or high school, I don't know whether should I attribute my blame to the parents who have ""forced me to control my anger"" knowing that it is not the correct answer to dealing with your inside problems because it would only be worse. I do admit that my parents are not good at helping me understand life except when they refer that life is never balanced which is true.

I even failed to fulfill the goal to keep in contact with my classmates because none would have ""Free time"" to hang out with me even if it is Summer break. I want to treat them with good respect because in the end that would be returned, right? Well even If I tried, none would feel like it. What is the point to live a life if you fall down through an open manhole at a young age and realize you could be stuck there forever?

Even typing these things feels like I only have negative energy. I am a self-doubtful person and whenever they say it will be better, it will not be better if I can't make any of my own progress. I don't want to end up in a unhealthy relationship by stealing the positive energy from my girlfriend until I have finally achieved my desire. I crave for positive energy which is very hard to obtain these days.

I cannot do suicide because I fear of dying. No matter how much this would make me because I will never do it even if I am depressed. I was simply made to suffer an eternity in this purgatory that I was born to. Whoever even dares tell me that the teenage years are the happy years does not understand that life is unbalanced and cannot revolve around one person.

Let me tell you also this. At the end of my school year, the school psychologist promised me to find someone I could truly hang out with from one of my classmates and guess what? She never did! She backstabbed me with ""happy propaganda"" just to give me false hope and make me even more miserable. I want to treat people with kindness and virtue, not to be turned down and sent to the bottom of the ""bottomless pit"". Never will I ever be able to get out of it and live a happy ever after life like the others would do. I appreciate their every move and I don't feel like being jealous about it, I just wanted to be with them, not be away from them.

I don't believe in my own happiness, the happiness itself in general, the confidence to get a girlfriend, the relapsing that will change someone for good, the desire to talk to others because you will vanish quickly. Goodbye!

,depression,"Imma start off by saying idk what I'm feeling exactly. I haven't really thought about it too much or talked to many people about my anxiety, I just felt like I needed to start here.

I feel like I have terrible social anxiety and its only gotten worse over the past year. I am an Asian kid 20yr/ol and I went to the US for college last year. I feel like my anxiety had been dormant while I was at home and going to a different country/culture made it come to light. Idk when I think about it I've never really been good in social situations, esp with my friends. I would like to believe that I'm fine with my family and people older than me, but it's bad when it's people my age. After going to the united states idk what triggered such bad anxiety within me but I can definitely tell that it's gotten worse and more frequent. For the most part, I am alright while interacting with my friends. Small talks don't bother me as such but I can't keep up with long, deep, meaningful, personal conversation that helps build relationships. My anxiety doesn't kick in every time I talk to people, but when it does idk what triggers it and it goes south real fast. I don't think I have that big of a social battery either, and when anxiety kicks in on top of that I just become fearful and paranoid (kinda, idk its hard to describe, like I don't want to exist). This has not happened to me often, in fact it has happened exactly twice, but when my anxiety is at its worst I cannot even order food. Like a task as simple as that feels like the most difficult thing you'll ever do. I started sweating and worrying and my head felt heavy like sth was weighing it down. I become so fearful of judgment. And now that I'm back home, my anxiety has stuck with me. I still feel terrible in social situations from time to time. Going to hang out with friends still feels like the worst decision I could make.

I still try to push myself to interact with people despite all of this. I believe underneath all of this I can carry a decent conversation with people.

I haven&amp;#39;t really thought about it too much or talked to many people about my anxiety, I just felt like I needed to start here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have terrible social anxiety and its only gotten worse over the past year. I am an Asian kid 20yr/ol and I went to the US for college last year. I feel like my anxiety had been dormant while I was at home and going to a different country/culture made it come to light. Idk when I think about it I&amp;#39;ve never really been good in social situations, esp with my friends. I would like to believe that I&amp;#39;m fine with my family and people older than me, but it&amp;#39;s bad when it&amp;#39;s people my age. After going to the united states idk what triggered such bad anxiety within me but I can definitely tell that it&amp;#39;s gotten worse and more frequent. For the most part, I am alright while interacting with my friends. Small talks don&amp;#39;t bother me as such but I can&amp;#39;t keep up with long, deep, meaningful, personal conversation that helps build relationships. My anxiety doesn&amp;#39;t kick in every time I talk to people, but when it does idk what triggers it and it goes south real fast. I don&amp;#39;t think I have that big of a social battery either, and when anxiety kicks in on top of that I just become fearful and paranoid (kinda, idk its hard to describe, like I don&amp;#39;t want to exist). This has not happened to me often, in fact it has happened exactly twice, but when my anxiety is at its worst I cannot even order food. Like a task as simple as that feels like the most difficult thing you&amp;#39;ll ever do. I started sweating and worrying and my head felt heavy like sth was weighing it down. I become so fearful of judgment. And now that I&amp;#39;m back home, my anxiety has stuck with me. I still feel terrible in social situations from time to time. Going to hang out with friends still feels like the worst decision I could make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still try to push myself to interact with people despite all of this. I believe underneath all of this I can carry a decent conversation with people. But for now, the anxiety is there, and it&amp;#39;s real. All of this is especially tricky because I feel like if I don&amp;#39;t go out I miss out on things. So it&amp;#39;s like a lose-lose situation for me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey just a quick question about a depressive dream don’t know if anyone can relate? I was inside a building with two other people and went on some 360 “roller coaster” and it was taking us to different countries (kinda cool lol). Well why everyone was having fun I was dealing with my anxiety thinking I was going to pass out and stuff so I was NOT having fun. Besides that, the guy I was with (who I don’t remember who he was) asked me “Bro, why are you so depressed?”

I am seeing a company provided therapist,  all she does is to praise me for my good efforts which I think are normal (like you know, not doing a reply-all when I am upset with a colleague). I am too poor to afford a therapist myself.

I want to switch therapist but I also feel bad about it and I wonder if my company will notice me switching. I dislike journaling in a ""single source"" because of privacy reasons - there are so many online backdoors nowadays and offline options are not good enough as I don't live alone, I am scared others will read my journal. At least if this one got read by someone I know irl, it is just one page. One entry.

I used to have a good psychologist, but she was too expensive and felt I progressed enough to not need her help. I learn from her that I can't be depressed for no reason - which is true. I just didn't want to admit the source. Today, I am depressed because I made a mistake at work. I may look like I don't care about work on the surface but the truth is I take failings personally, so personally I feel numb and helpless about it. I need some some guidance for this. I feel that there's something wrong with me psychologically to feel defeated by a mistake, which was in good faith. I am also thinking about the past mistakes I think and how it is gonna repeat again... Because I didn't want to put in the effort to change.

Another thing that bothered me is my new psychiatrist. I was supposed to have an appointment with him a few days ago. It was pushed back by a month...And before that I called him asking him for help to top up my insomnia medications but I hasn't been sleeping well and I am suffering from a loss of appetite. He didn't get back to me on meeting me ad-hoc. He is a very busy busy doctor I guess. At least my last psychiatrist will squeeze out time for me, staying back a little later so he could see me for 10 minutes when I told him the medication isn't working for me and I want to change back to my old meds. 

All this little tiny disasters in my life has sap me of my motivation, my energy, my appetite (I often skip meals or eat very little) and I don't even know what to do now. My depression will kill my career and academic prospects. But I don't know if I can even help myself anymore. I am passively suicide - thinking about ending it whenever a tiny disaster came.

I’m always too “weird” for other people but I’m only being myself. The things I’m interested in, I can’t find anyone else who is interested. So I’m just alone. All of the time.

&lt;p&gt;I know they answered my question is to stop over thinking make new friends but if I can&amp;#39;t go out with people I genuinely love and I consider my best friends what hope is there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep myself busy writing a book this is superhero action comedy but I&amp;#39;m scared of wasting my time on it just using that for an excuse while everyone else is making money falling in love I can say I wrote a book but it&amp;#39;s getting to the point where I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good enough excuse to be alone&lt;/p&gt;

I got my dog about 9 weeks ago and it started there. 

- I got ryker, he swallowed his collar on his journey from Canada to Montana. 

- second week he got iron poisoning from a cuddle toy and the owner was a bitch and didn’t care that he had so much iron in his body it looked like a Christmas tree.

- fourth week with him, was the day I got my surgery and it was suppose to be 20 min surgery and 2 days of healing in my knee. Turned out to be 3 hours long, and 6 weeks on crutches / boot.

- a day after surgery, I let him off leash in our own area, my neighbor dog mauled him ripped half his tongue in half. Now he has a crooked tongue, and $2500 later. The other dog owner she is a cunt and so is her stupid fucking dog.

- I then am taking longer to do shit because no one could help me put on pants, dress myself, or bathe myself. Work got upset despite me needing the surgery.

- I then worked for two years with said company, to renege on their promise to me 2 years ago if I took a shitty paying job, I would get more money. They ended up hiring 4 other people and for the job I was promised, they rehired a guy that went through 11 employees during his 3 years, then walked off the job. During that time he had a chick write “rapist” in his truck which I guess he thought was hilarious. He then shot a guy at his house in the chest and that’s who they hired over me

- I complained and made it very apparent as that was a horrible move. 

- I was brought in a meeting as I knew they were trying to get rid of me. I documented all of it including recording it. Now I
May have a wrongful discharge lawsuit.


- a guy I was suppose to meet canceled on me and said his mom died the exact same time we were suppose to meet.

- I bought a brand new car and if I knew I would have just been losing it a month after I feet it things would be different.

-now I have no income. No job.

,depression,"So I've been severely burnt out from university due to poorly-supported adhd, anxiety and depression making it so i never completed enough work to take breaks more than once a month. Also partially due to ingrained guilt at not being productive enough 24/7.

I've been off school for 3 months now and spend the days trying to be productive or enjoy myself but end up failing to do either (causing guilt). Days mostly consist of being too tired (worsened by meds) and uninterested to do much besides lay facedown in bed from 8am to 1am waiting until it's time to sleep. This includes interests like games or writing, and self-care like eating or showering which have to be forced after hours of trying to get up.

And because of parents, i have to recover from the burnout ASAP so i can get a job/return to school. This created a sort of Ticking Bomb time limit to recover from the depression enough to be productive and make use of the time off.

I considered just forcing myself to get a job, maybe one that causes minimal stress/social anxiety, but im unsure if that's condusive to relaxing enough to recover from burnout.

,depression,"This post may be a ramble- sorry I’m advance. 

I am 19 years old, and I’ve been dealing with mental illness since I was 11. Since then, I’ve been in cpep countless times, psych wards, residential facilities. After the last long term stay (when I was 16), I thought I was getting better. I’ve attempted twice since then, just hospital stays. 
I’ve been in therapy for so long, every 2 weeks. Therapy helped me a lot through everything. However, my adolescent therapist had to discharge me from her services August 2021, as I was getting too old. Since then, I’ve been trying to find an adult therapist. It’s either not accepting patients or super long waitlists and never getting a call. With my psychiatrist, she’s a whole story in herself. 
Due to past situations, I have a really hard time trusting anyone, therapists, doctors, etc. I’ve only trusted one psychiatrist in my entire life, but he was a fellow and got moved somewhere else. The one I currently have, I despise. 
As I am on my mother’s insurance, she sees who I see. So, she always finds a way to get ahold of her. My psychiatrist never believes a word I tell her. Only believes my mom, even though I never gave her consent to speak with her. I don’t even live with my mother. 
I have told my psychiatrist countless times about how I’d like to switch my medication, as it makes me feel NO EMOTION at all. I feel like a zombie on this medication, and all she does is add more to the pile I already take. She never changes the one I ask her to change. 
I took it into my own hands and ended up stopping my medication all together. I have felt better and it’s been a lot trying to manage emotions and actually feeling something, it’s been a lot. However, she never believes a word I say.
Example: I tell her I’ve been feeling better without the medication. She always asks “are you manic” when I even sound remotely happy. It makes me feel so… I don’t even know what word to use. It just feels awful. 
It feels awful how every time I am actually happy, nobody cares, nobody supports me, and everyone ALWAYS thinks I’m “manic” and “impulsive”. My mom acts as if she is some advocate for mental health awareness yet treats me like trash, and my dad caused so much trauma to me in the past. Not even the support that is supposed to be for ME believes a word I say, because my mom who doesn’t live with me told her otherwise. I feel like I’m just falling again just dealing with t all. It feels like it never ends. 
I would get a new psychiatrist, however I’ve called almost every place remotely close to my area and they all aren’t accepting new patients OR have a waitlist. 

I just feel like I’m not living, just surviving. It sucks, I thought I’d be thriving at this point… however the never ending crap is always there. Ugh.

,depression,"As the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why i'm even posting here.
I have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasn't ready to deal with that.
For all those years since it started i've had very bad episodes of being depressed for months, sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself.

I started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago, i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now i'm off meds and i'm pretty sure all of you know that's a slow process.

Today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city, i'm already stressef because firstly i don't have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans.
I came out to my mom, stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i haven't told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i don't want to.
But if i don't tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 2-3 years, if anyone here is trans i'm sure they know that doesn't feel nice to be closeted just bc you're scared or don't have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on.

I also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl, atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me, since i've struggled with that i can't risk losing an only irl friend by coming out.
I don't want to be alone at school anymore, been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i don't want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone.
Last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didn't.
I am extremly depressed right now, i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i don't have the strenght for any of this.

I am 33, project manager and senior estimator obviously have tied my identity to my occupation. Although thinking about a lifetime doing what I’m doing fills me with dread and unease. I am self diagnosed borderline personality disorder. Although it can be argued that these undesirable qualities are exacerbated by physical opiate dependency and a rationalized dependence on methamphetamines to counter the sedative of nature of roxys and fentanyl, in order to keep up with work. I’ve been somewhat of a disagreeable person unable or unwilling to fit in as long as I can remember. Even though I had always found a tight knit group of compatible  personalities. It wasn’t until I was older that I recognize this disagreeable nature was my resistance and opposition of the status quo. As I am I do not hesitate to voice my disagreement In situations that I’ve believe to be wrong. Maybe some would argue that my willingness to speak up and out is a good quality to have. And this is not true. already being oddball black sheep, expressing opposition has only allowed me to push away from people or make it easy for people to drift away from me. But it’s more than that I have been selfish and living hedonistically since I could make decisions for myself.  In middle school I was a different level of self involved and inconsiderate. But after that tumultuous confusing age I have been hyper aware in sensing and perceiving the feelings of those around me. Made every effort to always to be considerate and respectful of another person‘s heart, no games no leading on. It’s still true to this day, though I have bore a fair share of unhealed licks to my heart. I never dated just take ones time and space, taking commitments like that seriously, getting into an exclusive, meant I was willing to take a shot for the long-haul. Because I am choosy I was single and mingling or faithfully committed. But I am The offspring of two narcissists who married because of pregnancy. I found out this year that my Aunt has always adored and been proud of my siblings and I. Saying we were planted in hostile soil and chaotic storm but managed to grow through Becoming beautiful flowers. Obviously you can see she did not get along with her sister, my mother.  Parents went through a &gt;10 year divorce settlement process. My mom always thought my dad‘s just dripping in hidden wealth. But after years of investigatory auditors, you’d imagine they’d have found it.  They still go back to court to make sure her alimony is maxed out. This is relevant because he doesn’t work anymore. Comes in to sign payroll check, otherwise traveling or golfing. I have a book keeper who does payroll offline and payables. All project management, bidding/estimating, business development, billing/AR &amp; CRM is on me. My salary is what I made as an entry level project engineer when I worked for a GC. My raise requests to my boss/dad have all been rejected or ignored rather.  We’re profitable across the board on all projects. And since I returned 2018 after working for a hotel building GC, I have seen his monthly payouts go from 7k to now between 20k-40k. Half my mom takes. But it doesn’t matter how aggressively I commit to growth and profit, I see none of it. And what ever growth there is, mom is ready to receive. I can’t make any real changes in the office. The book keeper is basically extorting her job security from my dad for the numerous occasions of documented toxic and abusive management he’s put her through. So she can say she’s not going to use QuickBooks or anything that can be digestible for those who’d replace her. My dad hasn’t really spoken to me for about a year now because I have called him out for the toxic passive aggressive guilt tripping or furious outbursts. My brother is beholden to him and has basically cast me out as deplorable. My sister was someone i could always confide in. But I recently fucked that up. She got hired at a much larger company in industry and pretty much started talking down at me telling me I’m lazy for not getting a different job. She’s got maybe 2 years exp. In industry and it sounds like our family name and personable impression got her the job from how she described the interview. I got so upset and the rapid shift to better than thou that I pointed out to her what I’m saying here, minimizing her abilities. Sometimes I feel like I’m not in the driver seat when I get mad like that and say things I don’t  believe, mean or that I regret saying. Like I just watch it happen shaking my head like, you fucking asshole moron what’s wrong with you. I get invitations to discuss offers at least once a week usually over doubling my current salary.

,depression,"Good morning. 

Thanks for dropping in and giving this a read. I guess what I would like to open with is the quote 

""this moment will pass"" 

This quote popped up when I googled the title of my post. This quote is supposed to demonstrate the impermenance of the human condition and how things can change.

My particular set of pain arises from the fact that I strongly believe my moment has passed. The opportunities I had for the happiness I desired in this world passed me by. Or I actively destroyed them. 

due to my personal background my attachment styles are so fucked. I have zero friends in the town I grew up in (and which I am currently living). I was unable to be a good person to my partner of 9 years, and drove them away. Ultimately in them they provided the small amount of comfort I could get from other people. 

I cut off the only ""caregivers"" I had growing up. My mother and my grandfather as without going into detail lay the ground work for anxious avoidant and people pleasing attachment style. These people did things that show a child you don't love them. These people were not caregivers. Their patterns of behavior toward me were repeated in the friendships and romantic relationships I had throughout my teens and most of my 20s. 2 events from my childhood fill me with such terror I literally can't talk about them directly to protect myself. Coming to terms with that has been a dark driver for me. 

Leaving my ex is what drove me to therapy and led me to a lot of self discovery. And hence why I am here today. My mind is prone to terrible patterns of fear, pain, and rumination. This pattern would occur even in the ""good times"" (stable life with my partner and no critical eye toward the past). Things are only becoming more lonely, dark, and hopless. My point of view on where I am in life is quite low. I don't like or respect myself at all. For example because my ex told me I was overweight I began to eat under a thousand calories a day as a way to gain control over myself. Like I don't deserve to eat normally due to how unruly and lowly I have been in the past with my eating. And this pattern continues throughout my life at work, school, and with family.

what I've done so far to try and get better: 

-moved in with family to reduce financial and personal stress due to being alone 
-regular exercise
-regular outings with family
-nearly weekly expensive therapy sessions
- reading:how to fix a broken heart by guy winch. Self-compassion Kirsten neff. At last a life, the alchemist, how to change your mind, thinking far slow.
-weightloss dieting to look better
-creation of many dating profiles and chatting regularly with women via Snapchat 
-allowing myself to express repressed emotion by putting sad music on in my car and sobbing everytime I drive to and from work
-the use of recreational drugs after a nearly 5-8 year hiatus to try and feel something other than sadness 
- reaching out to as many old friends as possible
- going out on my own if I am unable to find ppl to go out with.

so this is where I get to brass tax. I want to live. I want to live the life I think I could have had if I had did things differently five years ago. I want to be a happy person who could show love and respect to someone I think of as my soulmate. The person I am is not that kind sweet man I remember being at 19.  I don't like this person I've become.

I thought I would lose this battle today but it seems that scheduling self murder can be interrupted by family. If I were to put numbers on it I think I have a 25% chance of suicide within the next 18 months. In my mind I'm suffering in a irreparable state and therefore do not need to continue. My plan is to get a carbon monoxide detector, run a hose from my tailpipe to the car and when the thing says I'm at murder concentrations go take a nap. I know the approximate location I would do it at and am working on a few journals for the express purpose of leaving. I know the people I would call and what details I would give to them before I ditched my phone and left cell service.

I want to live. I want to be happy again. Please reader if you have made it this far can you just say you see that I'm in pain and show me some empathy. If you want to take it to another level tell me if there is something you think I should do or do differently. I don't want to die. Well I do. But I want to be happy. You know what I am saying.

One way or another.

I hate the hand I’ve  been dealt especially knowing my situation was completely  UNNECESSARY AND PREVENTABLE And for some reason I blame myself. I wish I never walked in that door.&lt;br/&gt;
anyone here going through the same or similar situation that is dental related? I need someone I can talk to that can relate. I feel so alone, heartbroken and depressed over this. I’ve been a victim and I now know that PTSD is a very real thing. I feel like I’m living a nightmare and will forever even if that’s not true, the mental pain combined with the physical pain is a recipe for disaster omg&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"My parents have always been insanely strict , and has affected me socially.

From pre school to sixth grade, I went to a small Christian school (only 8 students in my class) and I did not get along with anyone there. My parents constantly compared me negatively to my peers. I was always above intelligence but they made fun of me being socially awkward, even though bruh my whole life I only knew 7 other people.

Fast forward, went to public middle school, and thrived socially.First time in my life I made friends and actually had my first kiss and made it to third base in 8th grade and was drinking . My parents did not want me dating and was basically living a double life , of frat bro at school and church boy at home.

High school, I still had my friend group and made new friends. Because of my parents pushing Christian values, whatever the fuck that means, they didn't want me to date and even though I had friends that were girls and kissed and all that, I NEVER  brought them to my house and avoided getting too close with them. They also started drug testing me junior year and whenever I went which I did once in a blue moon, literally would follow me and smell my breath and I had to be home at 7 pm. I basically had friends only in school and not outside of school, bc after my sophomore year, I stopped going to see them.

All the sudden, college , my parents are like you should get married and find a good Christian girl.I go to a big public city school , I'm from suburban TX , and my freshman and sophomore year I did fine academically, but the 2 years of rare outside social contact , fucked me up and I had trouble keeping friends.

I fell in love with a girl right before COVID, who was not Christian, she was Hindu, and I told my parents. My parents were fine with here but worried about her ""moral values"",but my grandparents, were like ""you coudn't find a white girl?"" . She also really liked to make bracelets and my parents would lose their shit because bracelets on a man look ""gay"".

Over time, dealing with it ruined me mentally. We ended up breaking up but I wouldn't bring up dating ever again with my parents.

The stress that came from the relationship plus covid led me to gain weight and my grades slipped. I still passed but my cumGPA had dropped from a 3.2 to a 2.8 in one year.

Over the summer,I met a new girl who was East Asian and I obviously hid the relationship from my parents. She abused by punching and slapping me, stole from my credit card,and I could not tell my parents cuz they'd be  like ""thats what happens when you date someone who doesnt believe in Jesus&gt;""

I ended up failing all my classes that semester, and when my parents found out they took me out of school.

They took my phone and my laptop away and I ended up working at a Fed EX warehouse for 4 months. I hated it and my depression got worse, bc every day I would come home to my parents screaming abt how I fucked up my life, and how they can't show their faces at church, bc their kid dropped out of school. I also had no contact with anyone. They would also scream at me for sleeping for so long.

In June, I began taking summer online courses, but I'm still working 6 hours a day. I do not have a phone so I still can't contact anyone and especially in compsci, when I'm stuck I can't contact friends to help which is led to my grades suffering.  Over the past month, I have woken up and have headaches 24/7.

Since Christmas, I have not had any contact with any of my friends and I have begun to talk to myself and I could give a shit abt my appearance so I've gained even more weight. My parents blame me for "" being in outer space and acting weird"" but I have had ZERO SOCIAL CONTACT with anyone. They still scream at me every day.

Lastly , my parents are big ON CHURCH but they have been screaming at each other since I was 2.  I've dealt with hours of screaming matches daily my whole fuckin life, and it's led to me being scared of others and I'm unable to stand up for myself.

,depression," We've been together for over seven years, three of which have been married. It's been an amazing seven years that I always think back on with a smile. She is my first love, and divorce seemed impossible to me even a month ago. Everything seemed so magical. But now divorce is a reality she told me yesterday. On our wedding anniversary.

We were married a few years ago. We weren't in a toxic relationship at the time (although there was a time when that relationship was, in the beginning), we had matured, and then we started talking about starting a family. It seemed like the right thing to do. Our relationship was no different than a normal marriage and we just wanted to secure the result of our growing up.

It was a great relationship. It was always built on telling each other the truth and not holding back on problems. On solving crisis situations together. She was my best friend, my lover, and it always seemed so permanent. We may have disagreed on some things, but it was never a problem.

It's probably worth starting a little further back. In February of this year, I cracked up. My stepfather died last August from a coronavirus, and after that I had to combine work and study to help my mom with the loans my father had gotten me. My employer was crap. She could call me at 1 a.m. to do completely unnecessary tasks. The pay was crap too, but it was a living wage. At the same time I was in master's degree program.

She was at home with her parents, in our hometown, Rostov-on-Don. I was in Moscow. I was trying to save money to start renting a place to live together. At the same time she was studying for the degree she wanted. It was hard for me, but I felt I could rely on her if I had a tough time. I expected mutual acceptance.

She came when I could save up; and it was a few wonderful months in a new place, a new page in my life. We had our problems, but nothing beyond what the average couple goes through.

But here I cracked. I dropped out of university, quit my job, and started looking for a new one. While preparing for another interview - I realized that I was emotionally exhausted completely. I had an accurate understanding that I was failing at the university. But realizing that I was falling apart and that I looked like a veggie was harder. She left to visit our parents, and I took off after her to my hometown. I was tired of the gray skies of the capital, I wanted sunshine, I wanted to feel alive.

I arrived, and it felt like I had been born again. Everything around me was so colorful and warm. It was 20 degrees Celsius in the south and 5 degrees Celsius in the north. And I didn't want to go back. I wanted to recover, I wanted a change of town. I was tired of the frantic rhythm of the metropolis.

But my wife had other plans. A job offer came up, and she came back. She had to move out of the apartment, get her things. She did it alone and stayed there. I thought we would go back to Rostov-on-Don for a few months, live in our own place, help each other out. She thought I would come back with her and we would work like crazy together, sharing the workload.

A couple of months later I came to visit her for her birthday and it was a wonderful weekend. We spent it in a tourist town, not far from Moscow, and when I drove back, we agreed to meet for our anniversary and live together again in September.

But just a couple of weeks later we started having a serious spat. The whole month of July. She was talking about how I left her alone and chose to run away from my problems. That her birthday weekend was a big handout to me. I said that she chose to be careerist rather than show support in this relationship. That I had completely stopped getting to know the person I was married to. And the sad part is that we had this conversation before and I thought it was a passed story. But it wasn't.

A couple of weeks ago she and I had another conversation. She said she would be thinking about getting a divorce. Whether we should give this relationship another chance. We didn't talk for a long time. I tried to prepare myself for a negative outcome. Still sent a gift on our anniversary.

I got nothing in return. And in the evening the words that the gifts served as a nice reminder of our past. And that she had decided to get a divorce.

I just feel devastated. I struggle with myself and my emotions, but I feel pathetic. I've been trying to get over it alone, but I can't and I break down into incomprehensible howls and tears.

It&amp;#39;s been an amazing seven years that I always think back on with a smile. She is my first love, and divorce seemed impossible to me even a month ago. Everything seemed so magical. But now divorce is a reality she told me yesterday. On our wedding anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were married a few years ago. We weren&amp;#39;t in a toxic relationship at the time (although there was a time when that relationship was, in the beginning), we had matured, and then we started talking about starting a family. It seemed like the right thing to do. Our relationship was no different than a normal marriage and we just wanted to secure the result of our growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great relationship. It was always built on telling each other the truth and not holding back on problems. On solving crisis situations together. She was my best friend, my lover, and it always seemed so permanent. We may have disagreed on some things, but it was never a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably worth starting a little further back. In February of this year, I cracked up. My stepfather died last August from a coronavirus, and after that I had to combine work and study to help my mom with the loans my father had gotten me. My employer was crap. She could call me at 1 a.m. to do completely unnecessary tasks. The pay was crap too, but it was a living wage. At the same time I was in master&amp;#39;s degree program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was at home with her parents, in our hometown, Rostov-on-Don. I was in Moscow. I was trying to save money to start renting a place to live together. At the same time she was studying for the degree she wanted. It was hard for me, but I felt I could rely on her if I had a tough time. I expected mutual acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She came when I could save up; and it was a few wonderful months in a new place, a new page in my life. We had our problems, but nothing beyond what the average couple goes through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here I cracked. I dropped out of university, quit my job, and started looking for a new one. While preparing for another interview - I realized that I was emotionally exhausted completely. I had an accurate understanding that I was failing at the university. But realizing that I was falling apart and that I looked like a veggie was harder. She left to visit our parents, and I took off after her to my hometown. I was tired of the gray skies of the capital, I wanted sunshine, I wanted to feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived, and it felt like I had been born again. Everything around me was so colorful and warm. It was 20 degrees Celsius in the south and 5 degrees Celsius in the north. And I didn&amp;#39;t want to go back. I wanted to recover, I wanted a change of town. I was tired of the frantic rhythm of the metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my wife had other plans. A job offer came up, and she came back. She had to move out of the apartment, get her things. She did it alone and stayed there. I thought we would go back to Rostov-on-Don for a few months, live in our own place, help each other out. She thought I would come back with her and we would work like crazy together, sharing the workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later I came to visit her for her birthday and it was a wonderful weekend. We spent it in a tourist town, not far from Moscow, and when I drove back, we agreed to meet for our anniversary and live together again in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just a couple of weeks later we started having a serious spat. The whole month of July. She was talking about how I left her alone and chose to run away from my problems. That her birthday weekend was a big handout to me. I said that she chose to be careerist rather than show support in this relationship. That I had completely stopped getting to know the person I was married to. And the sad part is that we had this conversation before and I thought it was a passed story. But it wasn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago she and I had another conversation. She said she would be thinking about getting a divorce. Whether we should give this relationship another chance. We didn&amp;#39;t talk for a long time. I tried to prepare myself for a negative outcome. Still sent a gift on our anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got nothing in return. And in the evening the words that the gifts served as a nice reminder of our past. And that she had decided to get a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel devastated. I struggle with myself and my emotions, but I feel pathetic. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get over it alone, but I can&amp;#39;t and I break down into incomprehensible howls and tears. It&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been abandoned for being depressed and not being able to &amp;quot;be strong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

This was close to 5 and a half years ago, and I would like to think I'm over it, but I still dwell on it from time to time. (Backstory: I had been homeschooled my entire life, but I never thought anything out of the ordinary about it. That was just how my life had always been. I just though it was normal) Anyways, the day was March 25th, 2017, and I was just chilling in my room on a cloudy Saturday afternoon. It didn't seem like anything was different about that day at first, it was just a normal, boring day. I remember being on Skype at the time, and I get a message from my friend's gf at the time asking me if I wanted to go to her school play. I was kind of caught off guard by it since I had never really hung out with friends before outside of them coming over to my house, but I wasn't opposed to the idea at all. It surprised me that someone had asked me to even go to something like that. It made me feel appreciated and important, which was new for me I guess. I remember calling my father to ask him if he could give me a ride later that night to the high school, and he was surprisingly more than happy to drive me. So 6:30 rolls around and we hit the road. My father had put in his Dark Side of the Moon CD, which I had heard bits and pieces of the songs here and there, but never in their entirety. We get to the neighborhood right next to my friend's high school and the intro to the song Us and Them starts to play. We come over the hill and I start to see the school. The combination of a slow, sad sounding, psychedelic song mixed with arriving at a place that, deep down I feel like i should've been there all along, did something to me in that moment. It almost made me realize something, but I hadn't figured out what that thing was. So my father drops me off and I step inside the highschool.

After I hung up, I felt like I had been gut punched. My emotions started to swell and I started bawling my eyes out. It hit me.

I’ve distanced myself from everyone I know, I always have, i’m introverted at heart but now I just feel so truly alone, i’ve never wanted a big friend group or anything like that but outside of my family I didn’t even get a happy birthday from anyone but it’s my own fault for never bothering to get close to anybody.

It’s been almost a year and i’m still not over my ex, i still check her instagram see her new boyfriend and feel awful, she was such an awful person to me yet I just can’t imagine dating anyone else.

Anything i’ve tried to improve at and be good at I just can’t appear to achieve anything meaningful no matter the time or effort i try to put into it, i’m very good at getting mediocre at things quickly but anything past that appears impossible.

The passions and interests i have just seemed to have waned I used to love math and physics and all that nerdy shit but now i can’t seem to enjoy any of it anymore.

I don’t shower unless i absolutely need to, i don’t brush my teeth or really take care of myself in any of the ways i should be as i just can’t seem to care about myself or my future.

I’m going into my final year of secondary school which is a really important year for me but my motivation is at an all time low and this scares me as it could make it unlikely for me to go to college.

I’ve been on anti-depressants and they didn’t change anything, i’ve gone to the shitty council therapy that they offer for under 18’s and the whole 9 yards, none of it seemed to help.

Absolutely nobody texts or really talks to me, my life consists of going to a workplace that leaves me alone with my thoughts for hours which honestly only appears to damage my mental health more, playing games that i don’t even particularly enjoy and sleeping, that’s it.

I’ve been talked out of suicide by my ex girlfriend and mom so i don’t really see it as an option anymore but man i just don’t feel like i’m alive, i’m just living because i can’t be fucked to kill myself.

I’ve probably got enough money to cough up on private therapy and i don’t spend money on anything really but is it really worth it? i’m just lost on what the do anymore.

i’m not really sure what this post is for, just sort of shouting into empty space as i don’t have anyone to say this to, my parents as much as they don’t want me to kill myself aren’t very helpful when it comes to my mental health and well my ex, has me blocked almost everywhere you could imagine, including chess.com haha.",t2_98blpis0,False,,0,False,I’m 18 and hope already seems lost,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_weud3f,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1659493500.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m only just 18 and life already seems so hopeless,

I see depression like a little monkey with cymbals. You know like the one you rewind and it starts hitting the cymbals and make a horrific noise.

But today was one of the day where the monkey won. It was a horrific day. I woke up early tried to do stuff while listening to podcasts. But the monkey didn't stop saying that the people I was listening to are living a life and that I don't have one. So the monkey started to compare me to people on the podcast.

I can't help it. I really do my best. I have friends who knows me for years and keep telling me that I have accomplished alot. But I can't help it

,depression,"... I just moved to a new city. I'm horrible at making new friends. I'm naturally fairly quiet and I've been told that I come across as cold and intimidating to people who don't know me. It doesn't help that I simply don't have any interest in being friends with most people that I come across. 

sigh. 

It must be nice to be the sort of person who is happy to make friends and socialize with pretty much anyone. 

I hate the feeling that I'm wasting time. I'm not going back to school until the winter semester. I don't really need to work right now, and I don't really have any interest in doing so either...

There's a dead tree that I can see from my window, ravens like hanging out on it for some reason. I envy the way they live, most of them seem to have a partner, there seems to be a sense of community among them... It would be nice, living a simple life, flying around... Being a person is fine, but it's messy and needlessly complicated- humans have a lot of potential as individuals, but I feel like society isn't really healthy for us. 

hmm... Well, whatever, I'm not even looking for advice or anything really. I guess I just wish that I had more interest in doing anything, or that I had someone interesting to do boring stuff with, or that... hm... shrug. I don't know. I'll manage I guess.

,depression,"It's hard to get out of bed for long without feeling useless and being bombarded with intrusive thoughts. Just bathing seems exhausting now.

I spent 3 years in a career field I thought I wanted, learned I hated it and am now transitioning to something new but it'll take a while.

Thought I wanted to create content and make music but quickly learned that I really don't have the drive or confidence for it.

Constantly feel regret and embarrassment for how I've handled things in the recent past. Split with my ex of 2 years because we were only spiraling together. I have no friends at all, and family members who were once close just feel awkward to talk to now.

Feeling spent and washed up, all at the tender age of 22... and hope of anything changing get clouded by the fact that I've grown out of all my old interests.

Music that's coming out nowadays doesn't captivate me like what was being released when I was a bit younger. Gaming doesn't entertain me anymore. I've lost all the charisma I used to have, and have somehow forgotten how to maintain casual conversation.

I don't do social gatherings anymore because of how jarring it feels walking into any club/bar/party ALONE, knowing that covid and monkeypox going around... with literally nothing to talk about. Just spells anxiety for me, and and an awkward time for sure.

,depression,"Hey, this is a throwaway acc. My life honestly isn't that terrible compared to others so I don't know what is wrong with me and why I have no motivation to do anything.   
I'm 15 and a rising sophomore in hs. I feel like a disappointment and a failure to everybody around me. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore or try to change myself for the better. I want to kms but I don't have the courage to do so when I think about the people around me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I wanted to become a psychiatrist but it feels pointless now, I am basically failed my first year of hs. I know I can do better if I try but I just can't seem to find any motivation to do so. 

I just stopped trying to do good in school, became more introverted the past few years. I used to be extremely extroverted and I thought it was because I moved to us from India so I wasn't used to everything so I became introverted but it seems like I was depressed way before than I thought I was. I have a poor self esteem because my family since they comment about my body a lot. I know they are doing it so I can change but it doesn't help me. I want to tell them all of this, to make them stop making me feel worse everyday but they already went through so much and I don't want to add more burden or things they need to worry about. I wanted to talk to my best friend about this but I feel like I would burden her so here I am. 

Whenever I have some motivation to do something about myself, someone in my family says something and I get angry and just don't do it anymore. I did try ignoring them but my relationship with them got really bad because we argued everyday and stuff and so I act like I'm fine with them so it's pretty hard to just block them out. 

My mom has breast cancer and had mastectomy recently and my grandpa is getting a surgery soon because one of his heart walls deteriorated a lot. My mom is a single parent who raises me and my brother (22 but he moved to a different state). She doesn't really know how I feel since I've never told her, she recently went through the surgery I mentioned earlier and she got one removed so her breasts removed so self esteem is pretty low as well. She always says how weird she looks and how weird her body looks. I really don't want her to feel like that because to me, she doesnt look like that at all. I don't understand why I look so bad to her when she doesn't to me. I do tell her that she doesn't look weird or anything like that but I don't think she really understands.

I lived with my grandparents for two years because my brother and mother went to us and I couldn't go yet since I didn't have my visa. During that time, my grandmother was extremely abusive and manipulative. I don't know how to feel about her right now even though I know she guilt-trips a lot and abused me before. She is living with us atm because of my mother's illness and she has gotten better. I think. But when I lived with her, I was in fourth grade and I almost committed suicide because my mother never abused me physically and mentally before, but I didn't have the courage to do it when I thought of my mother and how she would feel. I still want to do it but I still can't find the courage. I know I should tell my family about all this but that would just add more burden and I don't want to be more of a burden than I already am. What should I do? I don't know what to do anymore. Should I just tell them?

And since I&amp;#39;m nothing I don&amp;#39;t see a point in existing. Meds or no meds, I feel pretty much the same just without being horrified by an idea that I&amp;#39;m addicted to meds. &lt;/p&gt;

So when I have a rather okay day, I tend to not get too much bothered by crowds and ppl in general. I don't feel comfortable but I'm not really anxious but there are days, when I really don't feel good, my reaction changes so much.

,depression,"Hello everyone, 

I am a 24 year old female working in IT. I just graduated from college in January, and I thought everything would get better for me (aka I thought I’d be less depressed) after I landed a job in a different state, which is something I’ve always wanted to do. However, I unfortunately turned out to be wrong. For a short background story, I’ve pretty much dealt with depression and anxiety all my life, especially growing up in an abusive household. I always struggled in school (elementary, middle, high school, and college) and had a very difficult time finishing college. I failed almost all of my classes and got on academic probation twice. I was trying to major in biology at first because my parents forced me to (they wanted me to be a doctor), and even though I didn’t want to, I tried. But, depression and the lack of interest got to me and I ended up not majoring in biology which made my parents extremely angry. I honestly had nothing I was passionate about, so I just chose to try to major in computer science because you could make good money with it. Well, it ended up being too hard for me (and my mental health) and I ended up failing all of my classes and getting into academic probation. And, I was in therapy when I started to major in computer science. I also have to mention that at this time I was struggling with an eating disorder and with my weight, so that has also added a lot to my depression and anxiety. I just felt awful about myself; my abusive parents, my weight, my eating (this was my coping mechanism at the time and it still kind of is, although not as bad as before), failing all of my classes, pretty much having no social life, etc. So, my therapist told me to take some easy classes so that I could get out of the probation, and so I did. That’s what saved me from getting kicked out. So then, I decided to choose an easier major, IT (it’s very easy in my university) so I think that’s why I was able to graduate. Around this time I also started to take ADHD medication which helped me a lot with studying and actually getting work done in school. I was able to focus and had more motivation then I’ve ever had in my life. But then, the medication stopped working and actually started to give me panic attacks so I stopped using it. I then went to another psychiatrist and she prescribed me antidepressants which kind of helped. Thankfully also around this time I was able to land an internship in a different state and I was so happy about it. I was like wow, I can’t believe I actually succeeded at something for once. Plus, it was in a different state which meant that I could stay away from my family there. That internship was amazing, laid back, and I got to have so much fun because I was not under the control of my family. Plus, the internship was in a state which was very hot and sunny and I found that this helped my moods. After the internship, the company offered me a full time position after I graduated college and I was very happy to accept it. The pay was good and plus I got the chance to move out of my family’s house for good, somewhere far away. I love the place I live in now. However, right now I am 6 months into my job and I’m feeling extremely depressed again. The job is much more stressful than I thought it would be (it’s a tech support type role) and I didn’t really have proper training. The problems I have to try to solve are really difficult and I still don’t feel comfortable taking cases at all. What made it even more difficult for me is that I was assigned a mentor, but she was incredibly rude to me and never seemed like she wanted to help. She would always scold me for not understanding a customer issue or not doing something correctly, or even asking her for help. I had a secondary mentor too and unfortunately he was also not that nice and was condescending sometimes. Right now I am at the point where I feel like this job is way too stressful for me and I just feel so burnt out, anxious, and depressed. This job is all I think about and I try to do everything I can to distract myself and it’s not helping. The thing that’s giving me the most anxiety is that if I quit or get fired, I will have to pay back my sign on bonus to the company, which is A LOT of money for me. I just feel stuck, lost, and like a failure again. Why can’t I just suck it up and do the job like my other coworkers? Why can’t I just have at least an ounce of motivation? Why do I feel so fucking depressed again? Why is everything I’m doing not helping (therapy, antidepressants, distractions)? I work from home, so yesterday and today I left my place to drive around and do random stuff because I just couldn’t stand looking at that computer screen, and at this point I don’t care if I get fired anymore. But, at the same time I’m scared because if I do get fired or quit, that bonus will be taken away and my healthcare benefits will be gone. Anyone have any advice? I feel like I’ve tried to talk to so many people about this but I still feel like I really need help, I don’t know what to do. Thanks for listening. 

I also have to mention that my mother is pressuring me to get married and will not stop talking about it everyday. She has crazy expectations for my boyfriend and expects that we get married by next summer and that he has to get me a very expensive ring or else she will be angry (which I am not going to listen to her, but the fact that she keeps bringing this up and gets angry when I don’t agree with her is driving me crazy). She also complains about my weight (she has done so all my life and still complains till this day). She calls me fat and says that I don’t look good anything, and she even thinks my boyfriend probably doesn’t like my body.

,depression," about 6 months ago i tried to kill  myself went to a train station (it wasn't my first time on suicide  attempt, but that time i decide to go to a deadly place)

I  sat there on the bench, for a long time, then i stood up, got near the  train, one passed away i couldn't make myself to do it, second train  came in, i took few steps back, prepend to run towards the rail,    inspector has suspect that I'm going to do something ""crazy"" he stopped  me and i ran away from the station

i  tried to do better again keep taking my medicines, go to therapist and  psychiatrist found new friends that might care about me and i decided to  deny the existence of the situation to deal with life

I  knew that i wouldn't be able to work outside anymore because of other  problems, mentally and sleeping disorders.i saved some money and tried  to make a step towards the goal of working from home, i've learned  investment in stocks, and nowadays i try to do my best to succeeded in  that.

but i usually ask myself if it worth the try and today i am broken, the deny of the situation have hit me in the face

now  I'm thinking to myself, nothing is worth it, the friends aren't worth  it, the hard work doesn't worth it, the treatment doesn't worth it, and  I'm not going to be hospitalized like a monster I'm thinking about  correcting the mistake i did I'll return to the same station, I'll send  the friends my will, and I'll ran again without messing around like last  time that suffering will end, in a matter of seconds, i can't deal with  life anymore happiness is not in reach but i get a smile just from  thinking about the train, instant crush, no way back, not going to be  crippled for a stupid other act, it would be deadly

i've  tried in the past suicide hotlines on crisis but the only thing they  did to me is bringing me cops &gt;then go to hospital&gt; then they ask  me if i want to be hospitalized&gt;deny&gt;home

,depression,"I have gone through depressive episodes ranging from days to weeks. I am 30 now but have been experiencing these episodes for at least the last 9 or 10 years. I saw a doctor about them when they kept recurring on a monthly to bi-monthly basis. The doctor told me that because they don’t last longer than a few days that it wasn’t depression. I am questioning his opinion now.

During the week I feel fine most days. I keep very busy. I have work, school, am an avid gym goer and a multitude of other hobbies. The weekends scare the shit out of me. If I am stagnant I usually get that voice in my head that bombards me with negative thought patterns. These can last into the next week until I start getting back into my routine, which can be very hard to start up.

I recently made the connection with my down and out weekends and stagnation. I had few if any episodes during the winter this year. This year was also the first time I started reffing hockey. My weekend was full of physical and  mental activity. Now that it is the summer, I am going through more and more of these episodes.

These episodes cause a lot of issues in my relationship. They make it hard to get motivated for anything and make me want to hide away. 

I cant help but wonder sometimes “what is wrong with me?” When I see people that are happy all the time. I struggle to keep myself baseline more days than not. Ive done a lot of therapy and it doesn’t help me feel better, it just helps me control my reactions to things.  Im sick of this cycle.

I am 30 now but have been experiencing these episodes for at least the last 9 or 10 years. I saw a doctor about them when they kept recurring on a monthly to bi-monthly basis. The doctor told me that because they don’t last longer than a few days that it wasn’t depression. I am questioning his opinion now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the week I feel fine most days. I keep very busy. I have work, school, am an avid gym goer and a multitude of other hobbies. The weekends scare the shit out of me. If I am stagnant I usually get that voice in my head that bombards me with negative thought patterns. These can last into the next week until I start getting back into my routine, which can be very hard to start up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently made the connection with my down and out weekends and stagnation. I had few if any episodes during the winter this year. This year was also the first time I started reffing hockey. My weekend was full of physical and  mental activity. Now that it is the summer, I am going through more and more of these episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
