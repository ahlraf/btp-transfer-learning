###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable.

,SuicideWatch,"There's just something I can't wrap my head around. I've grown up in the culture that suicide should be prevented. That there are compassionate people who would want to stop you, plead with you. They can't help you otherwise... but they'll help you then. Help...?

So I cling to this idea but I don't understand it. I'm not helped by society otherwise. Any amount of time of the street I would most certainly pass away. People do all the time. Nobody cares.

Why do they care suddenly when you're not (yet) a homeless nobody and it's suicide...?

I also just don't understand, why if I'm so useless, and need to be taken care of, if I shouldn't just die? I don't get it? I can't live. No one should have to use their life to supporting mine. Society doesn't make it happen. There are no supports to access for me, for millions of people. Don't people want us to die?

Can I get assisted suicide? I think in Canada they recently opened it up for people with mental health issues. I am scared of doctors... They aren't trustworthy. Honestly they are horrible people in their positions. Take advantage. I wish only people who wanted to be doctors became doctors. The people who wanted to be there because they cared. Honestly, the other folks just shouldn't be allowed. They do great harm.

It's such a dissonance that just brings me to panic tears. No one wants to keep me alive, but I'm supposed to believe they don't want me to die either?! It's just unfair!

If I just lay down and wait to die, I'm a burden on the people closest to me. There's just the one... That makes it harder... On me, because it's all on him then. But ultimately, to not have to afford me just seems like it would be so much better for him. Right? I mean that's just logic. It shouldn't be on just some other poor sucker to keep me alive.

,SuicideWatch,"Everyone in my life has either used me or betrayed me in someway. Every long term relationship has ended with me being lied to or being cheated on. Every friendship was only vibrant in what I wish was a part of my life that didn't exist as a drug dealer. 

I have been used by everyone. I wish I could just be like a feral cat. Get struck by a car, go somewhere no one would find me or care to find me, and die. 

A year and 3 months sober means nothing when your change has no meaningful effect on your life. My weight loss from 230 to 160 is meaningless when looks aren't as important as the exchange of dopamine you can shortly give someone you've just met and even that always has an expiration date.

I remember about a year ago and 5 months I had spent 12 hours doing coke and drinking. I drew myself a bath and laid in it. I kept drinking heavily hoping I would eventually slip into a black out and die. Although my subconscious mind always pulled me from the water I hoped this would not define the remainder of my life, and would think back to this moment as my lowest.

But I feel like I never left that bath tub. I'm always drowning in what seems to be the same repeating simulated situations. Someone loves me, someone uses me, and my insecurities eat away at me.

Not a minute goes by that I don't consider my calling to the void. Everything at this point just seems so lucid. I smile and my customers love me at work, I go home I work out, I lay down and cry.

Although my subconscious mind always pulled me from the water I hoped this would not define the remainder of my life, and would think back to this moment as my lowest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like I never left that bath tub. I&amp;#39;m always drowning in what seems to be the same repeating simulated situations. Someone loves me, someone uses me, and my insecurities eat away at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a minute goes by that I don&amp;#39;t consider my calling to the void. Everything at this point just seems so lucid. I smile and my customers love me at work, I go home I work out, I lay down and cry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don&amp;#39;t have any other choice. Who can love someone so empty inside? Someone who&amp;#39;s only passing feeling is anger? I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore...&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Dear Internet,

I am a 36-year-old unemployed male living with my 80+ year old Grandmother who still works.

Last year I lost my life savings in a long-con, my stepfather, and divorced my wife. This is not mean’t to be a sob story, just seeking advice.

**I want nothing more in my life** **but to..**

* A) Have my Grandmother live without working and to financially support her fully
* B) Have a job (remote, but beggars can’t be choosers)
* C) Rent my own place.

**I have...**

* I have no degree.
* A long history of contract writing along with experience in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
* A current contract position similar to DoorDash. It's seasonal.

I am not sure how to ask for help here. I contemplated writing this due to the potential backlash but I don’t care anymore, I am just trying.

For awhile now, I’ve been unsure how to apply myself towards junior front-end development jobs or really be anybody that anybody wants.

I’ve kept applying on and off and had two interviews within the span of 4 years.

Two years ago I took a $10,000 bootcamp in San Francisco that assured job placement, and I’ve never felt dumber in my life. Apparently, my work was good and I have a portfolio.

Recently, I was inspired by an old high school friend to keep applying to tech jobs and that I can do something. I have a few coding projects in the pipeline, some previous work to show, but am still piecing together the masterpieces.

**In essence...**

I am wondering if there is anybody I could talk to or have as a mentor to help place me on the right track to get a remote development job. I am willing to sign a legally binding contract that gives you a return on your investment (% of my paycheck each month for a year or more) if your help results in job placement. I am serious.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how to ask for help here. I contemplated writing this due to the potential backlash but I don’t care anymore, I am just trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For awhile now, I’ve been unsure how to apply myself towards junior front-end development jobs or really be anybody that anybody wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve kept applying on and off and had two interviews within the span of 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I took a $10,000 bootcamp in San Francisco that assured job placement, and I’ve never felt dumber in my life. Apparently, my work was good and I have a portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was inspired by an old high school friend to keep applying to tech jobs and that I can do something. I have a few coding projects in the pipeline, some previous work to show, but am still piecing together the masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In essence...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering if there is anybody I could talk to or have as a mentor to help place me on the right track to get a remote development job. I am willing to sign a legally binding contract that gives you a return on your investment (% of my paycheck each month for a year or more) if your help results in job placement. I am serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my last shot.&lt;/p&gt;

so it's 2am in the morning and I'm just thinking about how odd my mother is. quite odd and quite different from me. see, my mother has gone through ALLOT and by allot i mean surviving a genocide and witnessing so many deaths at the age of around 14 and having to separate from her family to a different country at the same age. now i won't lie, her hard work already paid off. she apparently had the best time of her life around her 20s although fighting other battles on her own behind the scenes. And since she had nobody to guide her or advise her during that time, loneliness took a toll on her mental health. then a couple years later, she had me. at the age of 29.( other things have happened but i really will just spare you the details.)

now, what get's me thinking and questioning is..what person would go through all of that and decide to have a goddamn baby?? to me it's either A, she was pushed or felt pressured to have one or B, she just wanted one. and B being the most likely i still don't get it. why would you want one after going through the worst in this world?

I identify myself as an agnostic but I know i can’t live as i desire…they are always checking what I am doing etc etc. Even though my college is 4 hrs drive from their place, they frequently visit just to supervise me. I’m genuinely sick of this behaviour. I can’t go out with friends, party and even talk to girls because those are ‘bad’ things which will pull me away from religion. My plan earlier was to go and settle abroad after college to escape such shitty behaviour but as I know my parents will be reluctant to send me and even if I go they will keep an eye on me all the time. As arranged marriages are a norm here they will force me to marry a girl which matches their belief system and so practically I can never be on my own. I feel trapped in a cage.

I identify myself as an agnostic but I know i can’t live as i desire…they are always checking what I am doing etc etc. Even though my college is 4 hrs drive from their place, they frequently visit just to supervise me. I’m genuinely sick of this behaviour. I can’t go out with friends, party and even talk to girls because those are ‘bad’ things which will pull me away from religion. My plan earlier was to go and settle abroad after college to escape such shitty behaviour but as I know my parents will be reluctant to send me and even if I go they will keep an eye on me all the time. As arranged marriages are a norm here they will force me to marry a girl which matches their belief system and so practically I can never be on my own. I feel trapped in a cage. &lt;/p&gt;

My ex destroyed my life because I got sick of her taking her anger out on me and I tried to break up with her. And in return she told lies about me to everybody I used to know, telling them that I cheated on her. Everybody believed it and so they all left even my family disowned me. I've got no one. When I was in the hospital for an asthma attack about a month ago they asked me about emergency contacts and I didn't have anyone's name I could put there. Not a soul. I'm very sick now, my medication (effexor) that my doctor makes me take that I can't go off of without seriously risky side effects is making me very sick. I have diarrhea every day to the point where I bleed and everything I eat I throw up even water. I'm constantly dehydrated and I've had these symptoms along with a pounding headache for about 2 weeks and if I do in fact die my body is just going to rot in this apartment because no one's going to be wondering where I'm at. My corpse will probably be left in here for months since I've got my bills on autopay. Considering how shitty maintenance is around here they're probably not even going to do anything when it starts to smell.

All I ever wanted from life was companionship. Everybody I've ever met like me said that eventually they just gave up and we're happy with the fact that they would always be alone but I don't know how to do that. They say it's because that I seek validation from an outside source but that's not even it. I'm just very very alone. No one can imagine the level of alone that I am. I am the most isolated person on Earth. I was born to a couple of stupid hillbillies who didn't want a second child and because they had me late in life I was born with scoliosis. We were one of those old fashioned families who doesn't really bother trying to fix sickly family members, we just shut them away in the house and forget about them. I wasn't allowed to go to public school, I was homeschooled. Kept away from the other children because my parents were ashamed of me. And I was too weak to play with them anyway. My entire life was just spent watching the world go by and never being able to take part in it. On the outside looking in, shut away from everyone. It was like there was a whole world out there but I was stuck in this stupid little fucking bubble that I wasn't allowed to exit. It almost felt like this lifetime is one big nasty timeout session. Where I get placed in the corner and I get to watch everybody else have fun and make friends with each other and I don't get to be a part of it.

I want more than anything to connect with someone anyone. A real connection, shallow friendship isn't enough but I'll never have that. I don't know how I live this life anymore. It's been years since anyone has touched me in any way other than to hit me. I haven't been hugged since my ex ruined my reputation and I don't think I ever will be again. And that's all I want is just a fucking God damn hug which I will never get! After the things she said about me no one would fucking hug me. No one would even sit down with me and watch a fucking movie or have a drink with me. I could pay someone a $100 and they still wouldn't play with me. Everybody looks at me like I'm a goddamn monster and I just can't take it anymore. So I'm here. Waiting for someone to give me the benefit of the doubt. Listening ear that I will never find.

,SuicideWatch,"Man another rant. I read endless posts about shit like this. I guess there’s no use in really wanting to take anyone with me when I die. I honestly don’t see a use, if the world is so good, then why has it never showed itself. Sure you have to work for it but when not a shred of light is visible in this damned reality then what’s the point? Death is like the time before birth. There’s nothing. No heaven. No hell. Just nothing. It’s like your consciousness never existed. I’m ashamed but I fucking crave it I just want to not have consciousness I hate every damn minute of this, the only distractions I have are damn birds that will never understand me, and some stupid shit on the internet. I spend my life so far fucking staring at a screen or staring at birds that never even notice me, getting comfort more from these birds than any human ever has. 

Even if there was something destined for my future I don’t even wanna see it. There’s no point being optimistic. This reality is just a facade of ‘happiness’ all we do is fucking wake up eat work eat sleep. We spend hours doing stupid shit and sleeping or working. After years of that shit you just eventually die. Even if you did get your dream home and a good family then still whats it for, why do we even deserve it. It’s like nobody understand it, they just say oh there’s something in your life waiting for you ohh fucking no there’s not and even if there was theres no use waiting for it.

,SuicideWatch,"I didn't have friends growing up until about 8th grade. I got lucky because some girl that had a crush on me invited me to come watch doctor strange with her and her friends. 

Time passed and I joined her friend group and I guess I just got lucky to have that opportunity.

I fucked up a lot as a friend, but I kept learning and trying and learning and trying, and I started to feel happy, but for some reason it all slipped away, in one moment.

This isn't something I could've changed, we grew apart, but nobody ever gave me a warning, they just grew more distant from me and eventually admitted to it when I asked if they were tired of being friends with me. I worked my ass off and in the end it all slipped away. 

I can't be mad at them, I'm not their responsibility, but it's just sick. One day you've got a life and the next day you don't. Maybe you saw it slipping away but nobody told you a thing until it was too late, and now I'm right where I started. 

Nothing is fun. Nothing makes me happy. I'm out of friends and no matter how hard I try I can't make any more, but it's worse now.

Now I've spent a couple years on drugs and in therapy to fix myself, I've put so much goddamned work in to make things right, to make myself a better man, and here I am, still like this.

,SuicideWatch,"When I was about 1 year old, my dad stabbed my mom in the stomach with a knife. She didn't die from it physically. Mentally she slipped away and became an alcoholic. I grew up in a foster family. They were only in it for the money and they were mentally abusive to me every day. I felt horrible, misunderstood, worthless, a burden. The worst was the contrast I got from their beloved grandchildren. They got everything they wanted, while I was left with nothing. I felt like Harry Potter but without the magic. I have always had trouble making friends. The few friends I had was even harder to keep. I still struggle with this today and recently I lost a big friend group due to a few bad apples in the bunch. When I was 16 I discovered that my foster mom were having an affair with a family friend. Her phone had been ringing while I was home alone and I saw 10 missed calls from him. They were out eating dinner somewhere together (My foster parents, the family friend and his wife) I got curious about what had happened and started reading her texts. They were all from him about how he loved her and when they should meet again and shit like that. They had always held me to such a high moral standard. I could never do the slightest mistake, and if I did, they would berate me and make me feel like shit for weeks. So I confronted my foster mom with her affair a few days after that. She straight up denied it and told me I was a useless piece of shit that nobody would believe. I eventually showed my foster moms phone and the messages to my foster parents daughter and told her what had happened. She read the messages and told me that she would handle it.

A few days later I am in their car, heading for a kind of halfway house for troubled teens with nowhere else to live. They dropped me off with a few of my belongings and I assume they sold the rest of my things. For the second time in my life I was ripped away from everything I had known, Everyone I knew and this time I was on my own. I buried my feelings as deep as I could. Walled off the sadness and thought I could forget about it. Until one day I just exploded. I was in the middle of a classroom when I just started crying. I couldn't  stop and I had to be taken to a  acute  psychiatric hospital for a talk with 2 doctors. They listened to my life story and just told me that they had encountered people whom had been through less than me, but were on hard drugs to cope. They congratulated me on not doing Heroin and sent me on my way.

I am 32 years old and still live in that city. I have never had a job. I don't have any friends. and I just sit in a one room flat all day, staring at my laptop screen. YouTube videos, Netflix shows, HBO. And once a week I go shopping for easy to make food, Frozen pizzas and microwave dinners. I just keep myself alive. When I'm hungry I eat. When I'm tired I sleep.

But I see no reason to keep myself alive anymore. I contribute nothing to society. I didn't finish school due to the move. And I have no future. The few romantic relationships I've had, ended because I'm just a hopeless loser with no life. 

I have had so many hobbies in my life. I cant even remember half of them. Anything to take my mind off the shitty thoughts. The only hobby that I stuck with was playing guitar. But lately I don't even want to do that. I feel like a ghost. So why not become one?

My last girlfriend broke up with me and my mind broke. I was Hospitalized in a mental institution with suicidal thoughts. My lowest point there led me to a suicide attempt. I hung myself with a belt. Everything turned black. The staff pulled me down on the floor and revived me. When I came to, I couldn't see. It felt like when your leg falls asleep but all over my body. I was confused and had no memory of what had happened.

2 years later I sit here in my tiny flat (that I don't clean) Half my stuff is still in moving boxes from when I thought I would get evicted. and the other half of my stuff is scattered around the floor along with piles of trash and dust. When my Girlfriend left me I drank a lot of alcohol and played loud music to drown out all the shit again. That's when my neighbor knocked on my door and attacked me with a stun gun. The following days I spent in bed terrified. Then I got a notice that I was getting sued by the same neighbor for violence against him. He also had a bullshit witness that backed up his bullshit story and I lost the case. Almost got evicted from my ""home"" because of that but I ended up not going to prison. I just had to stay off alcohol for a year and have weekly consultations with a police officer instead.

I hate life and being alive. And I have decided not to stay. The only thing I like to do is to sit in the sun with a joint. But I cant get drugs where I live anymore.

I feel like I have no future. I am just drowning every day. I go to sleep and wish I don't wake up every day. I am a hollow shadow of a person-shaped piece of shit and my life cant get better. The prices of everything keeps going up, Cigarettes, food, anything really.

I think I will end my life soon. I can feel it in my bones. This world is not for me.

She didn&amp;#39;t die from it physically. Mentally she slipped away and became an alcoholic. I grew up in a foster family. They were only in it for the money and they were mentally abusive to me every day. I felt horrible, misunderstood, worthless, a burden. The worst was the contrast I got from their beloved grandchildren. They got everything they wanted, while I was left with nothing. I felt like Harry Potter but without the magic. I have always had trouble making friends. The few friends I had was even harder to keep. I still struggle with this today and recently I lost a big friend group due to a few bad apples in the bunch. When I was 16 I discovered that my foster mom were having an affair with a family friend. Her phone had been ringing while I was home alone and I saw 10 missed calls from him. They were out eating dinner somewhere together (My foster parents, the family friend and his wife) I got curious about what had happened and started reading her texts. They were all from him about how he loved her and when they should meet again and shit like that. They had always held me to such a high moral standard. I could never do the slightest mistake, and if I did, they would berate me and make me feel like shit for weeks. So I confronted my foster mom with her affair a few days after that. She straight up denied it and told me I was a useless piece of shit that nobody would believe. I eventually showed my foster moms phone and the messages to my foster parents daughter and told her what had happened. She read the messages and told me that she would handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later I am in their car, heading for a kind of halfway house for troubled teens with nowhere else to live. They dropped me off with a few of my belongings and I assume they sold the rest of my things. For the second time in my life I was ripped away from everything I had known, Everyone I knew and this time I was on my own. I buried my feelings as deep as I could. Walled off the sadness and thought I could forget about it. Until one day I just exploded. I was in the middle of a classroom when I just started crying. I couldn&amp;#39;t  stop and I had to be taken to a  acute  psychiatric hospital for a talk with 2 doctors. They listened to my life story and just told me that they had encountered people whom had been through less than me, but were on hard drugs to cope.

,SuicideWatch,"Please read the whole story before judging. 

I really should look into getting therapy but I just need to get this off my chest somewhere where no one knows me or my husband and might understand a little of what it’s like. Or just tell me I’m a terrible person idk. 

The last several years my husband has been overly depressed and he has been on antidepressants almost his whole life (He’s almost 40). He’s THE biggest pessimist I have ever met and it has gotten so bad over the last couple of years. The world is out to get him, no one likes him, every job sucks and everyone sucks. Nothing is good enough for him. All he talks about is killing himself. For days over the last several years I have been there. I have talked him off the ledges. I suggest therapy, I suggest the suicide hotline. He has a pessimistic excuse for all of it. ‘They just tell me I’m lying and to get over it and hang up on me’ or ‘they will change all my medicine and make me start over bc we moved and I have to find a new one’. I can’t say anything right anymore. Everything I say now is making it worse or means I don’t care. But my god. At what point do you just get fed up and tired and depressed yourself after dealing with this for so many years and just want to stop trying to talk him off the ledge and see if he would even go through with it? He wouldn’t. It’s all cry wolf. But I’m the bad guy for not trying to stop him so now there’s a new issue. He can’t keep a job bc they all suck and everyone hates him and makes his job harder. He stresses out over the smallest things and makes himself sick over it. There’s no jobs out there for him so he just has to stay miserable (his words) even though literally everyone is hiring. Now I’m on antidepressants and have been distancing myself from family and cut off friends because I just feel so mentally exhausted from dealing with this every day over the last several years. Everything is getting blamed on me (our finances, his depression, etc). I’ve learned not to speak back and to just nod or ignore it because it just makes things worse. I walk on egg shells. We’ve been together 14+ years and it has never been so bad. It’s just been over the last 4-5 years and I just don’t know how much more I can take. I attempted suicide when I was 13. I was being bullied at school. I took 16 Tylenol pills. I started throwing up and got scared and told my parents what I did. I was rushed to the ER and had to drink charcoal and be in the suicide watch room for a few days which is just a glass room with a bed. In a hospital. How embarrassing. Then I had out patient group therapy for a week. My parents couldn’t afford long term therapy and my mom wouldn’t allow me to take antidepressants (please don’t judge or comment on this. I’m past that). But I’m on antidepressants now and they worked at first. But now I guess with everything going on.. I just feel like I’m going back into my hole and want to drive off a cliff. Which shouldn’t be too hard bc I live in the mountains. I just need to get this off my chest. My family would just say it’s all in my head. Just try to be happy. Go outside. My husband would say join the club. Can’t blame him there. And I think I’m too afraid to go to a therapist. I think I’m too afraid of what I would learn about myself. And what they say needs to happen in my life to fix things. Plus there’s money that I don’t exactly have falling off trees. The funny thing is that I was just planning a ten year wedding anniversary photo shoot for me and my husband bc the SD card for our wedding photos some how malfunctioned while taking our pictures. So all we have are a couple cell phone pictures people took. Anyway. Today I’m considering living life alone and how much I would enjoy it and how much happier I would likely be and since he always says he’s so miserable here then I would just tell him to go back to his parents. Bc it’s obviously my fault for moving us out of state for a new life and new opportunities bc he definitely wasn’t miserable before we left where we were. 🙄 idk. I just want to give up so bad. I’m tired of fighting this fight. But at the same time no one else will fight it for him and maybe I should just grin and bare it and continue to support him and push therapy harder.

,SuicideWatch,"This summer has been a summer from hell. 

on June 12 of 2021, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. he had always been a smoker and had been doing so since he was 14 years old. 

My mom has been the sole caregiver for him and she has nothing left in her tank, not for me, not for my dad, not for my siblings, not for anyone. My grandfather died on July 14, 2022 at the age of 65. 

now that he has passed, we have been doing our best to go back to normal but unfortunately i have used food as comfort for the past several months. constant binge eating and feeling bad but then doing it again. I have gained 20 pounds in 13 months, all of it in fat.

&amp;#x200B;

today I tried to go back to school and was immediately greeted with a ""what the fuck happened to you"" when my teammates saw me. my world fell apart. I have been broken down so many times this past year and to hear my teammates ask what happened, where I have been, if I still even want to play basketball anymore has made me think more and more about suicide than before.

&lt;p&gt;on June 12 of 2021, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. he had always been a smoker and had been doing so since he was 14 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom has been the sole caregiver for him and she has nothing left in her tank, not for me, not for my dad, not for my siblings, not for anyone. My grandfather died on July 14, 2022 at the age of 65. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now that he has passed, we have been doing our best to go back to normal but unfortunately i have used food as comfort for the past several months. constant binge eating and feeling bad but then doing it again. I have gained 20 pounds in 13 months, all of it in fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today I tried to go back to school and was immediately greeted with a &amp;quot;what the fuck happened to you&amp;quot; when my teammates saw me. my world fell apart. I have been broken down so many times this past year and to hear my teammates ask what happened, where I have been, if I still even want to play basketball anymore has made me think more and more about suicide than before. &lt;/p&gt;

ive always felt like my parents babied me throughout my life. im forever grateful for their support but im so sick of living man. everyday i have to live with the fact that i cant drive, i dont have a job, im out of college, and i ghosted all my friends.

i just now had a really big fight with my family. which motivated me even more to write all what ive been holding in on here. fuck i hate that my parents gave birth to me. there is not one day where i dont contemplate living. 

i hate how i look. im short af, my acne wont go away, im not strong, i need glasses everywhere i go, my teeth are cavity prone, and if you couldnt tell im extremely insecure. why do my parents have such horrible genetics.

i recognize abt how horrible of a person ive become and i just want to leave forever. i want my parents to feel the guilt that their daughter killed herself because of them one day. i want them to suffer and think about how horrible parents theyve become. they raised someone so heartless and sadistic. its a shame that i had hope for them.

i wished they raised someone who didnt have crippling anxiety. i cant do anything- school, relationships, driver's license. i cant even bring myself to end my own life. 

if only there was an accessible painless way to die. really struggling out here but if there r any ideas i would seriously appreciate it. too scared of a painful death.

,SuicideWatch,"About 3 years ago, I told myself that I would just keep going until I couldn’t anymore. In a morbid sense, it was kind of a little inspiration. I would try to be happy and do what I needed to do and if I couldn’t make it, I would just end it all. I was planning (in depth) how to end it all back then anyhow, so this was kind of little a little “bonus run” on life. 

I’m in my 40s. I had been extremely unhappy in my marriage for a good number of years. She just made my life miserable. She was spoiled, ungrateful, manipulative, overbearing and I felt like a man-servant/prisoner. For years I just told myself that I would wait until the kids went off to college and then split. Simple plan on paper. As the years and months went by tho, I just couldn’t see myself making it that long. I was planning out accidents. Places where I could lose control of my car. Staircases that could most likely get the job done. Something that insurance wouldn’t contest. 

I snapped and said nope tho. I left. I told my wife I couldn’t take it anymore. I told her I didn’t love her and I left. I figured I would just give this a chance first, right?

Things are just hard. Really hard. It’s been almost 3 years now since I left. I see her all the time. She texts me all the time and for the most part it’s been cordial. I mean, there were obviously horrible moments - especially in the beginning. I see my daughters at least 5 times a week. 

I started dating someone 8 months ago and she found out two weeks ago. It’s been really hard since. I get walls of texts about how much I am hurting the girls and how I’m a terrible sick human. 

I never thought I would be back in a state of mind where I thought I could go through with it, but it’s so tempting. I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up. I wish I could just go away and everyone would forget about me.

Life story has enough content to write a series of books, but I'm not really going to file every wrong the world inflicted on me. 
Just know I have no family to fall back on, (don't even know the name of a single grandparent or cousin dead or alive). 
I've lost everything that mattered to me.
I've been homeless, and I have been isolated from any valuable personal interactions for 6 years, minus speaking to useless psychiatrists which should've counted for something but in the end that and all the different medications I've been on never solved anything. 
Told myself if my life was still going downhill after 5 years I'd end it, but I failed. 
It wasn't my first attempt. First time I was only 12 and leapt 30 feet onto concrete trying to go head first. 

Now I've scheduled a time and place. Until that time hits, I'll keep fighting and trying. I already suffer so what is more suffering going to do, end me quicker? Sounds good to me.
I've already done the self loathing on my ass until i lost my home.

,SuicideWatch,"this is my second time posting on here recently. i needed to get more off of my chest. my life in the moment doesn't look good. im very young and it seems since i am that i think super irrational about everything, and once i get older things will change. but honestly from what im looking at, things won't change. every time i turn around or recovery from a traumatic event, something else happens. the most recent one was my step dad passing away, the man i considered my father. he would've done anything to see me happy and now he's gone. my mom got strung out and left, leaving just my brother and i to fend for ourselves. 

luckily, we have an amazing grandmother that gave us our own place to live. but my relationship with both of them is bad. my grandma pushed me into starving myself, and my brother sexually assaulted me when i was younger. 

my grandmother consistently shames me, and only me (she body shames both of us, but she only shames me about everything else). my brother has always been her favorite. it never really bothered me until she started invalidating how i felt because of him. every time we argue, its always my fault. everything is always on me. i have to be the strong one. i have to be the one to face our abusive mom when the time comes, because apparently i handle it. i can't, i just don't show emotion enough for anyone to realize how much im on the verge of suicide. every time we argue, it's always ""x can't handle it."" even though, i just got out of a mental hospital for attempted suicide. my brother has every opportunity to speak his mind, but i can't. even though, all he does is tell me how bad of a person i am all of the time. when the only reason im so agitated is because i can't sleep or eat. but apparently that makes me like my abusive mother, according to my brother. 

earlier i went with my grandma to go pick up my brother and i had just taken 10 benadryls so i was very tired, out of it, and agitated. he asked me if i didn't something to my hair, to which i replied with ""mhm."" when he didn't hear me i responded rudely, ""i said yeah."" which started an argument. he told me i was like my abusive mom, like he always does. my grandma took me to my mom's house (i was staying with my grandma until i could move into our new apartment) because they blamed me for the entire thing. which i know seems so miniscule, but ive been barely keeping it together as it is. my grandnma has always hated me since i was a kid. ive always been the one in the wrong. she never looked at me and thought this kid just needs someone to love them, she always just hated me. and she says she doesn't, but she makes it very obvious who her favorites are. 

it hurts because i just want someone to love me. 

and even before that, i tried to confide in my friend about being suicidal. they responded with ""uh damn, anyways im playing a video game."" they usually are pretty helpful and i know they are okay with me sharing these kinds of things with them, so this hurt. they've been so different lately and i know it's because both of us are barely hanging on. but after the most recent times they've genuinely hurt my feelings, i don't trust them anymore. talking to them doesn't feel the same. they were my one and only. they were my safe space. but now thats gone too. 

these things seem so small, but i don't know if i could ever put into words how im feeling right now. sure, my life has been full of trauma. but im tired of blaming everything on what happened to me. i don't need to talk about it anymore, i just need to feel okay. but after all of it and seeing the person ive become, im not sure thats even possible. ive been struggling with my mental health for so long and it's only gotten worse. i don't think i can do this much longer. i have no one to turn to anymore. ive genuinely never felt this alone. i feel so empty and im so tired of the mood swings every day. im so tired of the 3 hour breakdowns i have every day. im tired of becoming irrationally angry and ruining things for myself. im tired of not being able to sleep, or eat. im tired of constantly trying to fill the void with drugs, sex, alcohol, and people that i know will never be able to love me. im tired of burdening the people around me. everyone has made it pretty clear how much they dont love me, how much i burden them. i have nothing left here anymore. whenever i look around and see how many people hurt me or people ive ruined thngs with, i realize that im just a monster. everyone will be better off if i wasnt here anymore. i planned to kill myself on my birthday in 10 days, i think i might actually go through with it.

This song won’t write itself

This feelings won’t deal with themselves 

But I have no will to deal with them 

I’m so spent 

I’ve become so spent

I wake up every morning 

I wish I could sleep for longer 

I go to bed everynight 

Wish I wasn’t a feeling monger 

Don’t wake me up 

Please don’t wake me up 

Swimming in the sea 

Am I swimming or am I floating 

Floating in this sea 

Am I floating or am I drowning 

I can’t tell, I can no longer tell 

No one made me wax wings 

I could never reach the sun to melt them 

And all these broken parts 

I know I will never mend them 

And the home that I never found 

I’ll find in your memories 

First just let me go 

To the place where no home is 

I’ll be no longer struggling 

I’ll be no longer drowning

i dont kno.w why but i decided to reach out to some people from my past and i was excited it seemed to be going well until of course it didn't last. good things do not last for me. i shouldnt have done it. this person is using me as a replacement for someone else much more important to them and it made me spiral. i dont hold worth. none of my words hold anything special to anybody my voice is garbage to everyone around me. i wish i had the guts to tell them i want to be listened to as well, to be asked about my life and my thoughts. i dont think anyone cares about me in that way. on this day, after realising why they were talking to me, my mind was plagued with self hatred. why is every decision i make the bad one? why did i ever reach out to anyone when im perfectly ok alone? i cried so much. i cried and cried and the people i live with never know i cry because i dont want to be a nuisance. but i couldnt hold it in. my pain leaked outside of me and it was the biggest mistake i could have made. my parent was upset with me for not telling them about a meeting i was having, i was going to tell them but my sibling did it before i had the chance to. after i calmed down a little i was going to. it led my parent to believe i was never going to tell them. i was already so deep into my breakdown i ended up raising my voice a little. i have avery quiet voice so it probably sounded the same to them. they didnt care about what i had to say. they told me they would throw away my food if i didnt go get it and i cried while eating it. i have not been hungry since. the situation made me feel like i was 15 again, like my whole existence was a mistake. i remembered that just because i am an adult now, doesnt mean they love me, it just means they can no longer abuse me like they used to. they have been ignoring me since then and its extremely triggering (sorry for using this word). i have never felt so alone. they saw me crying and threatened to throw away my food. i wish i was dead. my other parent, when i first came to them about being suicidal, told me suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. i have never told them about my tendencies again. 10 years later, i am still suicidal, i still feel alone. i hate myself for opening the floodgates. i hate myself for thinking i could ever get better or have hope. i want to curse everyone out and punch walls until my fists are bleeding and broken. i have always had to keep my pain silent. the last thing i want is to be a nuisance. sometimes i feel like my pain isnt real because I've never taken medication or been hospitalised. ive only attempted suicide once and i laugh at it now, because it was so pathetic it barely caused any damage. i dont see a life for myself. i want to cry all the time so people can see how much im suffering. i want to be able to say the correct thing i want to be enough but im not and never was enough for anybody. i wish i didn't have so much hatred in my heart, but i wish my parents never met and never gave me my damage. i don't want to do this anymore. if god could give me one thing, it would be to disappear as if i never existed , so nobody mourns me and nobody is left with the scars of my death. another part of me wants them to hurt. i feel disgusting. i really do not want to be a nuisance to anybody anymore. im sorry if this all sounds fake or made up i dont trust anything i say at this point. and im sorry for the awfully long post.",t2_qzp3k9g7,False,,0,False,i dont know what to do anymore,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_wha1u4,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1659743478.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i feel pathetic writing this on reddit of all places. im suffering a breakdown currently and its very painful. ive been crying for two days straight and all i can think about is killing myself. i would do it in a heartbeat if i wasnt afraid of the pain. i dont like this, i dont like being alive. nothing is going right and never has and never will. posting this isnt going to help me. i need to talk or else ill really lose my mind and i want to be listenedto at least once. nobody has to read this it has no purpose or meaning nothing i say will ever have any meaning.

i hate living here. about a year and a half ago i completely stopped talking to my family. i completely just went mute. my whole life has consisted of my parents breaking out into fights over my dad’s cheating, my mom takes it out on me, and then one day they just completely act like nothing happened. they have no fucking idea how confusing and damaging that is to a kid. to watch your parents have a screaming match, give each other the silent treatment for like a week, and then one day when i come home from school they’re chatting over lunch as if nothing happened. this happened again 2 years ago — the big fight. over the same thing. my mom tried to take it out on me and it triggered the fuck out of me. i couldn’t believe this shit was happening again, and so i defended myself. mom didn’t like that and she talked to my 2 sisters saying that i was ungrateful and whatever other lies she got them to believe enough for them to stop talking to me. 

my family (except my dad) don’t talk to me anymore. i never talk unless i’m at work. i don’t have any friends. i don’t plan on attending graduation because my family won’t be there in good spirits. i don’t know what i’ll do after graduation. i don’t have any hobbies because i just can’t be fucking bothered with anything. i’m angry all the time. just one glance at my mom and it feels like my skin is on fire. 

suicide has been on my mind for the past 2 years even moreso than when i was a teenager. i’ve made specific plans, and i’ve tried pills but it hasn’t worked. but i try to get out of it. i do try to be happy. meditation worked for a while, but then i started drinking. i stopped drinking and been clean for a couple months now and i’ve started going to the gym. the gym helped so fucking much. i remember back in june driving to the gym and thinking that i liked my life so much in that moment that i didn’t want it to end for once. in fact, i remember thinking that i’d be really sad if it did end right then and there because i actually had activities i was looking forward to. i don’t feel that way anymore. i woke up yesterday at 6:30am and immediately started crying because i did not want to be here. today i woke up and kept my eyes shut for a while hoping i would just go back to sleep because i don’t wanna be here. i brushed my teeth and washed my face because that usually helps me get the day started. then mom shouted at me about slamming my bedroom door, which i didn’t but she’s in a bad mood — she just wanted to pick a fight with her punching bag. i planned on having breakfast but the shouting ripped away whatever motivation i had for this morning. 

i don’t want life after graduating college. i plan on moving out, even if i could only afford rent for a couple months, because it won’t matter anyway. my last months will at least be spent away from the toxicity of my family. i’ve tried to get better. i’ve don’t so much for myself and i’ve rises from the toughest situations, but the motivation for that comes and goes. and rarely does it come. i have to force it. i don’t want to force it anymore. it makes me cry because i have a little love for myself, and i don’t like how i’m treated. i don’t like that i hurt myself. i don’t like that this life is hurting me. i’m so fucking tired. i walk around this house knowing i’m not wanted here. “you’re so impossible to live with” my little sister told me the other day. i literally don’t even speak.

I’m not okay, and I haven’t been okay for a long time. Every day I feel like something is wrong and I’m just trying to fix it as I go about my day. At work, I try my hardest to do my best and be happy for the people I work with and for, but sometimes it’s too much to ask.

I want to tell them to leave me alone and that I’ll be fine but the truth is I don’t know if I’ll really be fine. I’ve gotten so close to being admitted that it’s no longer funny to me. I don’t wanna make jokes about myself anymore because it’s gotten that morbid.

Any and every time I’m not smiling like a bitch, someone just HAS to ask if I’m okay. It never fails to happen. I understand they’re just trying to be nice, but by now, the answer should be obvious.

last night my boyfriend told me that i'm like a completely different person and he misses who i used to be. he feels like the old me died and it hurts more than anything. he said i feel like a stranger and he isn't happy in our relationship but he can't see himself with anyone else so he doesn't want to leave.

,SuicideWatch,"Apologies if this post is a little long.

I (26m) really can’t see how I ever recover from the situation and head space I am currently in. 

I feel so guilty for feeling this way and putting myself into the position because I’ve had every opportunity to make something good out of life.

I’ve been to uni, got a first in my masters and completed my professional training. I’ve worked for 2 of the biggest firms in my field (albeit on low salaries) and due to start at another top firm on Monday with an average salary.

I’ve felt depressed consistently for at least a decade now, maybe longer. I will have good days but never really get to experience a meaningful consistent streak of them. I can’t remember the last time I went more than 2/3 days without thinking about ending it all. I have thought about how to end it and planned how to on so many occasions. 

Fundamentally, I know deep down that if I was to do anything I would just be taking the pain I feel and forcing it onto everyone else that knows me. 

I recently split up with my girlfriend of 2 years. This is the second long-term girlfriend, both of which had been really good to me and been amazing people which I have decided to split up with. It’s feels like I am trying to self destruct at times. 

Once I finished uni I had some debts which took some time to sort but I managed to pay off. Over the past 5 months since leaving my girlfriend, I’ve fallen off the rails. Spending above my means, drinking excessively and on several occasional booked last minute trips to try and get away for a bit. This inevitably has caused my debt to rise and now I am probably around 10k in the red. This is highly embarrassing to manage in such a short space of time and feels so manic. 

I hadn’t told anyone about my current debt or previous debt (apart from my ex girlfriend, who again was extremely supportive). 

In June, I was staying at a friends, who had a big pot of ibuprofen pills. We’d been out drinking all night and when we got back to the flat, I took roughly 30 of these before bed and had written a small note. I don’t know if this was a genuine attempt or just a cry for help/attention seeking. Either way, I felt deeply ashamed and embarrassed.

2 weeks ago, my mum came downstairs one evening and found me crying so I decided to finally tell her how I’ve been feeling all these years and about my current situation. I did not mention the pills due to shame. Her reaction only made me feel worse as it came across as more annoyed that I hadn’t said anything sooner rather than comforting.

I used my last available money to fly to the first destination (Greece) possible and haven’t spoken to my mum properly since. I just got back home yesterday and have been hidden away in my room. Obviously this just made me feel worse, more guilt etc. 

I feel like an absolute mess. I’ve messed around my parents. I’ve left the two most kind, caring and supportive people in my life on both occasions. I’ll go days without texting my friends back because I’m too anxious to go on my phone and they’re all looking out for me. Ridiculous financial decisions. All whilst having every opportunity to live a great life due to my education and work opportunities.

,SuicideWatch,"I am 20 years old right now and been living in a chronic suffering for the past 4 years. It will be very long text, but I just wanted to take this off my chest.

Since childhood I had mostly an introverted personality. I hated this about myself, because I had always wanted to be much more social, but I had difficult times finding someone.

I decided I would have more friends after I graduate from high school and attend a college. Spend more time hanging out with my peers, traveling around and so on. That was what made me happy after all. I studied very hard and to my family's surprise, I got into top 3% in the State University Admission Examination, which meant I could pick any university with State Scholarship. That was very blissful moments of my life but did not last long.

My aunt wanted to me to marry her daughter and told my parents. My initial answer was, of course, a big NO, but due to our shared family history with her (She helped us a lot financially in the past), she wanted to forcibly make a marriage between her daughter and I, because of what I call ""curse of success"". After countless hours of conversation with my parents, I was very frustrated. I was 16 at that time and my parents were the only ones I trusted, and finally gave up arguing with them, which resulted in my loss.  


Not only I am against relative marriage, but also did not like her daughter at all. I did not have any prior experience with any girlfriend so, for the past 4 years I have gone through some sort of Pre-Hell with her. She was not interested in me either, and always had been very neglectful, negative, repulsive to me. Due to the difficulty of my university studies, I was able to convince my parents to postpone this marriage for 4 years, but the inevitable would come sooner or later. During the 4 years I did my absolute best to prevent the marriage, everything I could besides suicide, but to no avail. You might be tempted to ask, why it is such a difficult problem. There are two answers: 1) it is frowned upon by our society when a girl is not accepted by a family and sent back 2) her father was a strict follower of society's rules and could do anything, I mean, anything (even blackmailing us).  


It has been 2 months since this hell of a marriage ceremony and I am undergoing even more difficulties right now. We have visited Marriage Counseling for a couple of sessions what what the therapist said was she is not ready to take any responsibilities of a family, and I was affected by her neglectfulness very badly. I cannot take any steps back anymore. Even during 2 months, there had been several big fights between us, because of her repulsive nature and my inability to withstand that. I respect her as a person, I do not have any personal grudge, but I also know we are not meant for each other. Again and again, countless big fights and our parents, along with hers are against divorcing. Her father is from higher ups, thus he blackmails to do something bad.  


At my age, my peers from university enjoy their life free of what I am going through. At my age, many discovers themselves, having great time with their friends or working on their future. But I am stuck with something I cannot reverse. I cannot focus building my life, but think how I could have prevented if I did not give up that day 4 years ago. All I think about is there is nothing I can do except for committing suicide, because of some shitty society rules.

Again and again, countless big fights and our parents, along with hers are against divorcing. Her father is from higher ups, thus he blackmails to do something bad.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my age, my peers from university enjoy their life free of what I am going through. At my age, many discovers themselves, having great time with their friends or working on their future. But I am stuck with something I cannot reverse. I cannot focus building my life, but think how I could have prevented if I did not give up that day 4 years ago. All I think about is there is nothing I can do except for committing suicide, because of some shitty society rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have wasted my potential all these years on someone/something that had no positive impact on my life, and I really do not know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

i wish i could go to school, i wish i could have friends, i wish i could have my own room, i wish i could hold eye contact, have conversations, be normal.

but i cant, i cant live without being stressed and i cant tell anyone.

i have no plans and i have no future, nothing i try seems to work and all i do fails.

my face is fucked and my life is meaningless.

my mom is having another daughter, she doesnt need me anymore, this is good. she can try again, im sure my little sister will be great.

im sure she will be loved, like my little brother is,

i did what i was supposed to, i was the test dummy for two idiot kids that got pregnant too soon, i can be thrown away now that they know how to be good parents.

i is oddly serene to think about it this way, im the eldest of five and all my siblings will have a good life.

i hope my mom's business can take off and she can stop worrying so much.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in my own place now, and lately I realize I&amp;#39;m just a nobody. I live alone, my friends have all moved away or adulted up into marriage or whatever, and I don&amp;#39;t get out anymore. I used to go hiking and camping, usually with a friend and because of covid, finances or no social circle it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I reach out people tell me how fucking simple it is to just go out and meet people, like its magic. At work I don&amp;#39;t want to open up when someone asks me how I&amp;#39;m doing because if I tell them what&amp;#39;s REALLY going on then I have to open up with backstop, reopening old wounds and honestly I hate feeling and looking weak. So I bottle it up. Nobody knows. I&amp;#39;m just another lover who keeps to himself reading a book or watching something on his break.&lt;/p&gt;

All day every day all I think about it wanting to kill myself and escaping this hell. I can’t let him go. It’s torture. I’m killing myself inside holding onto a man who doesn’t want me. I have 2 young children (9 and 6) and try and remind myself they need me no matter what. But I’m a mess. And certainly no mother to them this past year at least. I don’t want to go out. I struggle to eat. Can’t sleep or sleep too much. I’m a wreck. And I just want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"(Apologies for the long post, I just really need to get it all out on a page, even if it's just for me. Please feel free to scroll past.)

I'm in such a good place right now. I'm in my early twenties, making 6 figures in a cushy engineering job straight of college. I'm getting raving feedback from my coworkers, who are all rooting for me to get promoted. I'm eating three self-cooked meals a day, good meals: fish, spinach, pasture-raised eggs, produce in all the colors of the rainbow, you name it. I'm living in a luxury apartment with a room I've decorated how I've always dreamed I would, and I bought myself my dream car. I exercise regularly and get a good amount of sun and cardio with a dog who I love with all my heart.

I've never been more certain that I'll commit suicide.

I've always struggled with depression. Severe depression at times. I've gotten close to killing myself at least three times (suicide note written and sealed, door locked, knife to my wrist or rope around my neck). I've never done it because I was always convinced things would get better, but they never did.

As a child, I was heavily abused both physically and emotionally. For trivial ""sins"" like eating too slowly or spilling a cup of water, my dad used to drag me into the bathroom, force me to strip myself completely naked, and he'd hit me until I couldn't breathe. If I didn't cry hard enough, he'd hit harder, and if I cried too hard, he'd hit harder because I was crying hard on purpose. Almost a decade later, I can still remember the white rings that would wrap around his irises when he would yell at me, the way his face contorted. It would echo off the walls, his anger, his yelling, his slamming. It was endless. My mom loved and admired him wholeheartedly, still does.

Privacy was never a thing. If I wanted to listen to a ""pagan"" song, I'd have to print out the lyrics for my mom to approve. YouTube was banned. The Internet was more or less banned as well. If I wanted to hang out with a friend, my mom would have to have a dinner with the parents first. If I bought myself a phone or tablet, it would go on my parents' dresser every night before bed, and they'd go through it every night. My dad used to brag proudly about how if he found out that we liked someone, he'd tell everyone and make jokes about it and make *sure* we were embarrassed. So naturally, romance was never a thing either.

I never got a break. I was home schooled for the first 14 years of my life, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad was a pastor who only ""went to work"" on Sundays, so I was always within reach. I was never allowed to have a bad day. But complaints that they expected me to be perfect were scoffed at because they didn't beat me for other, more trivial things, did they? I remember being very young, curling myself into my closet, and writing that I wanted to die, that I hated my parents, that I wanted them to die, that something, anything would happen to make it all end.

Ironically, those were the happy years. Or at least, the only years where I don't remember **actively** planning to kill myself.

Around 13 or 14 years old, I started growing pubic hair, so my dad stopped beating me, but by then it was too late. They sent me to a public high school when I was 14 because they saw it as a test of my faith in the Lord (the only test I failed lol), and as soon as I got there, I worked like a menace. By then, I was sentient enough to know that this was my chance to get to a good college on a good scholarship, which would be my ticket out of their house.

I played the game. I took an unhealthy number of honors and AP courses, I joined ASB, created charity clubs and got recognition from the city for my contributions, used no-credit courses to boost my GPA, I was captain of my sports teams, played up to varsity, joined NHS, Key Club, all those scams. I was in it to win it.

At home, I had to listen to hours of my dad screaming at my less-ambitious older brother, threatening to kick him out or beat him. Sometimes it was because my brother forgot his assignments at home, other times it was because he wanted to hang out with his friends when he had a B in English. It wasn't like he was a bad student. He was still a brilliant honors student with a 4+ GPA. He just didn't care about perfection. And that was unacceptable.

I worked myself to illness. I was getting an average of three hours of sleep, and I'd picked up the nasty habit of hitting or starving myself whenever I made a mistake. I'd stay up all night setting ridiculous standards for myself. I had to memorize a chapter of my textbook verbatim or I was undeserving of sleep. I had to hit a can with a volleyball in the dark or I was worthless. I had to complete a practice AP exam in half the time limit, or I was pathetic. I failed, I had to start over. If I needed water or sleep, I was weak. I got hospitalized for several days with a fever of 106 after a particularly rough finals week.

My parents loved it. Bragged about me all the time. It was the first time I'd ever felt valued by them. I began to think things could be okay if only I'd stay perfect.

So the exhaustion and illness didn't teach me. Nothing did. And in senior year, it finally caught up to me. With the pressure of the college applications, the last step to the final verdict, I couldn't take the possibility that I could fail. I began to plan my suicide. I'd already begun cutting regularly and alienating myself from my friends. My chronic self-starvation and sleep-deprivation certainly didn't help.

On the day I planned to kill myself, I set aside the suicide note and the blade, and I was going to kill myself right after school. But by some miracle or tragedy, my favorite math teacher noticed something was off, and I was in an ambulance to the ward before I knew it.

In the days and weeks following, I was bedridden. My parents were furious. They told me I was trying to guilt trip them. They told me I would go to hell. That I thought I was better than God. That I was ungrateful. Selfish. Stupid. Crazy. Then they would cry because they were worried. They sent me to a therapist who broke HIPAA to tell my parents I was upset with them. They sent me to another one who ""really liked it"" when I wore shorts. I didn't talk to any of my friends. I cut myself endlessly. I skipped my meals. I would get up at random points of the day and walk all the way across the city and hope someone kidnapped me or hit me with their car. Then my brother would find me, and back to my bed I'd go.

I was caught in limbo. I had to make the decision. Either I'd kill myself and stop the torture, or I'd fight on and try my hand at living in college and create the life I knew I could create. I wanted both outcomes so badly my chest ached.

But I chose the latter. I picked myself up, forced myself to do the assignments, forced myself to ace my tests, forced myself through. I chose to believe in a better future. I chose to work towards that future.

I graduated top of my class, albeit less gracefully than I'd hoped, and got into the ""number one university in the U.S."" on a huge scholarship with the most selective major, exactly what I'd worked for. I was ecstatic. I'd chosen correctly, hadn't I? I packed my things and moved into the dorms.

It didn't take even a year in college before I was raped. Looking back I can see it so clearly how it all happened. I was so excited, so hopeful. The people around me weren't the ""shady devils"" with cigarettes and raspy voices that my parents taught me to fear. They were academics. Aspiring engineers who took AP classes and SAT summer courses. People who like libraries. People of the same cut and mold as me... right?

I didn't question it when my best friend offered me a snack with an innocent smile. And when the ceiling was swimming above me, and he was between my legs, it was too late to question it. Afterwards, everyone laughed about it. Called it ""crazy"" in that grinning, head-shaking way all college adventures are reminisced on. This repeated itself several times, until I considered it a kindness when he'd fuck me without drugging me because at least I wouldn't get a headache after.

It wasn't until I tried to resist him that it got violent, so it wasn't until then that I'd ever considered the possibility of rape. It wasn't like my parents had ever taught me anything about consent. And I hadn't been around enough people to know that the words ""I can't wait to see how I change you"" were a red flag in a friendship.

When the big, violent Rape happened, the kind that gets passed around in newspapers, it was too late. He and I were in the same friend group, and stepping away from him meant losing all my friends, friends who were in my dorm, in all my classes. I tried to talk to my rapist, but he wouldn't listen. I confided in one of the friends in the friend group that something might've happened and asked if it was something I should bring up, and he said I shouldn't.

I woke up the next morning to find that all of them had blocked me on all social media platforms and were under the impression that I was going around, falsely accusing people of rape. When I tried to apologize, they laughed and said I should be glad I wasn't getting gang raped. I tried to report it, and the college did nothing. The boys found out I tried to report and told the RAs I was threatening their health and safety. I was put into a year-long investigation to see if I would get expelled.

I almost killed myself twice. Was hospitalized twice. Was forced to make the choice twice. Life or death? I'd already lost so much. Everything I'd worked for in high school. College was ruined. My grades were suffering. My friendships were ruined. Everything was shit.

And despite it all, I chose life again. I chose to believe it would get better. That I could build things up again.

Then COVID hit. I was back at my parents' house.

They'd recently undergone a ""transformation"". My dad no longer yelled, and so I, of course, was under obligation to reward him with a deep father-daughter connection. And my mom? Well, she'd never done anything wrong, ever.

My dad, after finding out I was raped, starting making rape jokes. If my dog would jump on him in greeting, he'd yell, ""Me Too! Me Too!"" My mom started saying I was prettier before I got raped. My hair was nicer, my clothes fit better, before. ""Why are you so mad?"" they'd ask. ""Why don't you spend time with us?"" And I'm rushing through this because this post is way too long, but given that it was 2020, it was bad. Really, really bad.

I chose life. I dug my heels in and reverted to my high school self. Worked myself to ashes. Yanked my GPA up. Took 20+ units a quarter. I dodged the expulsion and graduated a year early from college with honors and a job lined up. With my picture in a slideshow and my diploma in the mail, I packed up and moved away.

I moved away, and I built the life that I have now, my dream life, and I am miserable.

I've developed delayed-onset PTSD. I have vivid nightmares of shit as far back as my dad yelling at me for taking 20 mins to eat a meal. Or plain old flashbacks of being raped. I smell weed and remember the weed on my rapist's breath when he was raping me. Any time I go to the office for work and I'm surrounded by my all-male team, I have intrusive visualizations of them gang-raping me and of my parents finding my mutilated body and making jokes about it. Any time one of my teammates says anything in a slightly altered tone, I'm terrified.

I'm struggling with OCD and perfectionism that has only worsened since I've moved out. I have an awful, impending sense of doom when things aren't ""just right"". I constantly doubt myself, put myself down. I stress about work until I'm shaking, and I check and recheck everything I do.

My manager loves me and says all my teammates think I'm incredible, that I'm super smart and helpful and make everyone's lives so much easier, but I wish they didn't notice me at all. I feel like I'm expected to be likeable because I'm the only non-man on a team of roughly 20 men who are all at least 7 years older, so I can't get away with not being likeable, but I don't know how to be likeable. I'm terrified of them. I don't trust my own tongue. None of my jokes or words come out right, and I sound all wrong. I worry about being too ugly to respect and too pretty not to rape.

I don't know how to make friends. I've forgotten how. I'm scared. I don't trust my own judgement anymore. I don't know what the rules are. If I'm being annoying. If my laugh is too strident. If I'm asking too much. If I'm accepting too much. If I'm giving too much. If I'm giving too little. How often to make eye contact. What the hell I'm supposed to talk to them about.

I feel like there's a certain way that people live when they have friends. They form their thoughts like they're things meant to be shared. They develop hobbies with room to breathe, with ways to invite others in. They read books with discussion topics in mind, with the desire for others' input and the assurance that they will receive it.

Between my isolated childhood, my traumatized isolation, and COVID, I have rarely had occasion to think this way. If someone asks me what I think of something, I have thoughts, and they come out complete, polished and sealed, with a beginning, middle, and explicit end that rounds the conversation off and shuts it down. I don't know how to foster a conversation that promotes discussion. I don't know if I ever have. And at this point, I think it's too late to try because everything inside my head is defective or broken or desperate, and I cry far too much to make any friendship pleasant.

Because I moved away from my home, away from my abusers, I am also separated from everything familiar to me. All my high school friends are dispersed across the country. I connect with them digitally through social media, but I think they're getting tired of me. I send too many things to them, respond too eagerly. It's pathetic. I am so lonely.

I feel myself spiraling again, and I know this time, this is it. If I fall apart, my job, my independence, my autonomy, my options to flee if my rapist shows up at my door, everything. Everything is at risk.

And if I fall apart again, what am I supposed to do, choose life again? Choose to work for that better future? For what?

I've learned by now that the phrase ""life gets better"" isn't true. Yes, life will get better, but then it gets worse again. Far worse, before you can even recover from the first blow. Life isn't a fucking movie where the One Big Bad Thing happens and the protagonist just has to work through that, and then the music changes, and you know it's over. There is no music telling you it gets better, there is no One Big Bad Thing, it's just life, brutal and volatile and long, and you are stuck in it for the rest of your life.

I'm starting to get the sense that suicide is just a logical conclusion to a life like mine. I've had so little control over my life, I feel like the very least I can do for myself is give myself control over how it ends. And I know all the statistics about failed suicide attempts, but at this point, I don't care.

It's not that I think my suicide would mean nothing. I know there are people who love me, who look to me for help or inspiration. But how much more do they want? Haven't I given enough? I tried so hard. Wasn't it enough? If not, then will there ever be a point where I've given enough? If not, then am I really the problem?

It's not that I think life won't get better. I know I have it in me to make life get better. I know that if I wanted to, I could push forward and make myself something incredible. Or just make myself content with being pleasantly mediocre. But for what? To get hurt again? To lose again? To watch everything I've worked for fall to pieces again?

I've proven myself, and I am tired.

The only thing that keeps me going my dog and a stupid shred of hope that I am wrong. I am doing all the right things, feeding myself well even when I want to starve myself, I am exercising, drinking water, sleeping, going outside in hopes that I can at least make it long enough to support and love my dog until he dies.

But I feel myself slipping slowly. I relapsed on cutting after over a year of being clean. Bought myself nice, sharp cutting blades too. I dropped my therapist when the company screwed up my insurance and acted really shady, and I don't have the energy to look for a new one. I am two poorly timed disasters away from giving up completely.

I am so bitter and angry that I am realizing this now. I wish I'd killed myself in high school. I am so wrong now. Every inch of me, every cell of me, all of it is wrong and far too touched, but not touched enough, and I will die this way. I feel delirious and sick. I want to laugh it's so foolish. I'm so foolish, sitting here in my nice, expensive apartment that I comfortably afford, typing at a fancy computer, away from my abusers, well-fed, safe, with a stable career, typing about how sad I am, how sorry my life is.

Why am I not happy? Why am I so miserable? Why can't I just get over it and shut up? I know why, but I wish it didn't manifest itself in this way. I'm tired.

Anyways, if you read through this whole thing, you deserve a gold star and to do something that makes you smile, so make sure you go and do that. And if you have any words of advice, I'd appreciate it, but no worries if not. Thanks for sticking through it :).

Please feel free to scroll past.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in such a good place right now. I&amp;#39;m in my early twenties, making 6 figures in a cushy engineering job straight of college. I&amp;#39;m getting raving feedback from my coworkers, who are all rooting for me to get promoted. I&amp;#39;m eating three self-cooked meals a day, good meals: fish, spinach, pasture-raised eggs, produce in all the colors of the rainbow, you name it. I&amp;#39;m living in a luxury apartment with a room I&amp;#39;ve decorated how I&amp;#39;ve always dreamed I would, and I bought myself my dream car. I exercise regularly and get a good amount of sun and cardio with a dog who I love with all my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been more certain that I&amp;#39;ll commit suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always struggled with depression. Severe depression at times. I&amp;#39;ve gotten close to killing myself at least three times (suicide note written and sealed, door locked, knife to my wrist or rope around my neck). I&amp;#39;ve never done it because I was always convinced things would get better, but they never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was heavily abused both physically and emotionally. For trivial &amp;quot;sins&amp;quot; like eating too slowly or spilling a cup of water, my dad used to drag me into the bathroom, force me to strip myself completely naked, and he&amp;#39;d hit me until I couldn&amp;#39;t breathe. If I didn&amp;#39;t cry hard enough, he&amp;#39;d hit harder, and if I cried too hard, he&amp;#39;d hit harder because I was crying hard on purpose. Almost a decade later, I can still remember the white rings that would wrap around his irises when he would yell at me, the way his face contorted. It would echo off the walls, his anger, his yelling, his slamming. It was endless. My mom loved and admired him wholeheartedly, still does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy was never a thing. If I wanted to listen to a &amp;quot;pagan&amp;quot; song, I&amp;#39;d have to print out the lyrics for my mom to approve. YouTube was banned. The Internet was more or less banned as well. If I wanted to hang out with a friend, my mom would have to have a dinner with the parents first. If I bought myself a phone or tablet, it would go on my parents&amp;#39; dresser every night before bed, and they&amp;#39;d go through it every night. My dad used to brag proudly about how if he found out that we liked someone, he&amp;#39;d tell everyone and make jokes about it and make &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; we were embarrassed. So naturally, romance was never a thing either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got a break. I was home schooled for the first 14 years of my life, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad was a pastor who only &amp;quot;went to work&amp;quot; on Sundays, so I was always within reach. I was never allowed to have a bad day. But complaints that they expected me to be perfect were scoffed at because they didn&amp;#39;t beat me for other, more trivial things, did they? I remember being very young, curling myself into my closet, and writing that I wanted to die, that I hated my parents, that I wanted them to die, that something, anything would happen to make it all end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, those were the happy years. Or at least, the only years where I don&amp;#39;t remember &lt;strong&gt;actively&lt;/strong&gt; planning to kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 13 or 14 years old, I started growing pubic hair, so my dad stopped beating me, but by then it was too late. They sent me to a public high school when I was 14 because they saw it as a test of my faith in the Lord (the only test I failed lol), and as soon as I got there, I worked like a menace. By then, I was sentient enough to know that this was my chance to get to a good college on a good scholarship, which would be my ticket out of their house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played the game. I took an unhealthy number of honors and AP courses, I joined ASB, created charity clubs and got recognition from the city for my contributions, used no-credit courses to boost my GPA, I was captain of my sports teams, played up to varsity, joined NHS, Key Club, all those scams. I was in it to win it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, I had to listen to hours of my dad screaming at my less-ambitious older brother, threatening to kick him out or beat him. Sometimes it was because my brother forgot his assignments at home, other times it was because he wanted to hang out with his friends when he had a B in English. It wasn&amp;#39;t like he was a bad student. He was still a brilliant honors student with a 4+ GPA. He just didn&amp;#39;t care about perfection. And that was unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked myself to illness. I was getting an average of three hours of sleep, and I&amp;#39;d picked up the nasty habit of hitting or starving myself whenever I made a mistake. I&amp;#39;d stay up all night setting ridiculous standards for myself. I had to memorize a chapter of my textbook verbatim or I was undeserving of sleep. I had to hit a can with a volleyball in the dark or I was worthless. I had to complete a practice AP exam in half the time limit, or I was pathetic. I failed, I had to start over. If I needed water or sleep, I was weak. I got hospitalized for several days with a fever of 106 after a particularly rough finals week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents loved it. Bragged about me all the time. It was the first time I&amp;#39;d ever felt valued by them. I began to think things could be okay if only I&amp;#39;d stay perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the exhaustion and illness didn&amp;#39;t teach me. Nothing did. And in senior year, it finally caught up to me. With the pressure of the college applications, the last step to the final verdict, I couldn&amp;#39;t take the possibility that I could fail. I began to plan my suicide. I&amp;#39;d already begun cutting regularly and alienating myself from my friends. My chronic self-starvation and sleep-deprivation certainly didn&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day I planned to kill myself, I set aside the suicide note and the blade, and I was going to kill myself right after school. But by some miracle or tragedy, my favorite math teacher noticed something was off, and I was in an ambulance to the ward before I knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the days and weeks following, I was bedridden. My parents were furious. They told me I was trying to guilt trip them. They told me I would go to hell. That I thought I was better than God. That I was ungrateful. Selfish. Stupid. Crazy. Then they would cry because they were worried. They sent me to a therapist who broke HIPAA to tell my parents I was upset with them. They sent me to another one who &amp;quot;really liked it&amp;quot; when I wore shorts. I didn&amp;#39;t talk to any of my friends. I cut myself endlessly. I skipped my meals. I would get up at random points of the day and walk all the way across the city and hope someone kidnapped me or hit me with their car. Then my brother would find me, and back to my bed I&amp;#39;d go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was caught in limbo. I had to make the decision. Either I&amp;#39;d kill myself and stop the torture, or I&amp;#39;d fight on and try my hand at living in college and create the life I knew I could create. I wanted both outcomes so badly my chest ached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I chose the latter. I picked myself up, forced myself to do the assignments, forced myself to ace my tests, forced myself through. I chose to believe in a better future. I chose to work towards that future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated top of my class, albeit less gracefully than I&amp;#39;d hoped, and got into the &amp;quot;number one university in the U.S.&amp;quot; on a huge scholarship with the most selective major, exactly what I&amp;#39;d worked for.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there&amp;#39;s a certain way that people live when they have friends. They form their thoughts like they&amp;#39;re things meant to be shared.

I&amp;#39;ve had so little control over my life, I feel like the very least I can do for myself is give myself control over how it ends. And I know all the statistics about failed suicide attempts, but at this point, I don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I think my suicide would mean nothing. I know there are people who love me, who look to me for help or inspiration. But how much more do they want? Haven&amp;#39;t I given enough? I tried so hard. Wasn&amp;#39;t it enough? If not, then will there ever be a point where I&amp;#39;ve given enough? If not, then am I really the problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I think life won&amp;#39;t get better. I know I have it in me to make life get better. I know that if I wanted to, I could push forward and make myself something incredible. Or just make myself content with being pleasantly mediocre. But for what? To get hurt again? To lose again? To watch everything I&amp;#39;ve worked for fall to pieces again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve proven myself, and I am tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that keeps me going my dog and a stupid shred of hope that I am wrong. I am doing all the right things, feeding myself well even when I want to starve myself, I am exercising, drinking water, sleeping, going outside in hopes that I can at least make it long enough to support and love my dog until he dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel myself slipping slowly. I relapsed on cutting after over a year of being clean. Bought myself nice, sharp cutting blades too. I dropped my therapist when the company screwed up my insurance and acted really shady, and I don&amp;#39;t have the energy to look for a new one. I am two poorly timed disasters away from giving up completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so bitter and angry that I am realizing this now. I wish I&amp;#39;d killed myself in high school. I am so wrong now. Every inch of me, every cell of me, all of it is wrong and far too touched, but not touched enough, and I will die this way. I feel delirious and sick. I want to laugh it&amp;#39;s so foolish. I&amp;#39;m so foolish, sitting here in my nice, expensive apartment that I comfortably afford, typing at a fancy computer, away from my abusers, well-fed, safe, with a stable career, typing about how sad I am, how sorry my life is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I not happy? Why am I so miserable? Why can&amp;#39;t I just get over it and shut up? I know why, but I wish it didn&amp;#39;t manifest itself in this way. I&amp;#39;m tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, if you read through this whole thing, you deserve a gold star and to do something that makes you smile, so make sure you go and do that. And if you have any words of advice, I&amp;#39;d appreciate it, but no worries if not. Thanks for sticking through it :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: fixed wording and spelling&lt;/p&gt;

I want to do it in away that hurts nobody, I&amp;#39;m thinking of driving my car out of the bridge in night..I&amp;#39;ve been lonely so long and I can&amp;#39;t bear the thought of being lonely for 10+ more years, I&amp;#39;m 22...if  I had just fixed my issues earlier and didn&amp;#39;t lie to her, I would have not lost her.. but there is nothing I can do  now and I feel so hopeless and empty that I can&amp;#39;t take it long.. I go to therapy.. but I can&amp;#39;t promise I won&amp;#39;t kill myself, since I don&amp;#39;t really see myself being able to handle the loneliness and being alone my whole life, I think it&amp;#39;s better that I just die, I don&amp;#39;t deserve to live. Only reason to live is my parent&amp;#39;s cats and the university.. but I&amp;#39;m just not strong enough to take this.. I think suicide is only way out, only way I can be at peace..&lt;/p&gt;

The only thing that gave me happiness and stability was my partner who I looked forward to seeing, stayed over at his house for cuddles whenever I've been stressed and down, etc. And now he says he's fallen out of love with me whilst also saying millions of contradicting things and my head's all over the place.

Also earlier this year my friends from my only other hobby all decided to side with one guy from the group who became transphobic.

Since then, I've been living in my car for the past 2 weeks. The sun has been scorching me alive. I feel myself...becoming zombified. This is the new normal. I cant even be an efficient homeless person; I know I could get showers at the gym, stay in an air conditioned building, get a job while I live in the car, maybe even fake a proof of income. But it's like...I just can't. I cant accept that this is how it is. Now I keep my car on to charge my phone battery because it's my only source of entertainment and ability to contact rentals. 

I've always had differing views than the majority in my life. I find it really hard to find hope and purpose in the life that so many of us live. Since I've become homeless...class structures have become super apparent to me. Everyone is just falling in line, terrified to be outcasted and doomed to a fate such a mine. No one looks at me and if they do...I get the feeling that they think I am dangerous, or just unproductive scum. Friends that I thought were there for me....yea, they know I'm in this situation...and they dont bother to know how im doing anymore. Like I broke the social contract and now I'm just trouble. All the while humanity itself is heading to its collective doom and we just pretend like it's not a thing.

Cant help but think that by even being alive...I am harming someone. Harming the environment with my car running. Harming animals by eating shitty fast food. I cant stop it...I am weak. I really needed that new beginning. I could become vegan. Reduce my carbon footprint or whatever. But would I really do that? I need change. 

Now instead of circling down the drain...wasting my money away...being mad at the world...I think the biggest impact I could have is to be selfless.To give up everything I own. Donate to animal shelters where they are truly innocent vessels in this life. Maybe my death could be poetic in a sense. Yet...I truly don't want to die. I really don't. It would hurt. There's so much beauty in this world beyond the suffering. I feel like I'm being rational here; like I've gained too much knowledge and it will never go back. I see things for how they truly are. 

I dont expect anyone to read but...I wish they would. So many desperate whispers here in this sub. But guess what? I cant care to read them either. I'm just so caught up in myself.

I haven't been eating properly for the last week or two. I barely sleep and I finally showered for the first time in a week.

,SuicideWatch,"Every day I wake up it's either by anxiety or lethargic. 
Tw. Just in case. 


 I'm honestly sick of being consistently invalidated because I'm either ""too young"" or ""I'm lying"" especially of my difficult upbringing. It doesn't help that even though I've been diagnosed with ASD, I've had people tell me off that I can't be autistic because I'm not r* slur or I have ""functioning"" limbs said by normal people and some men on the spectrum (their reasoning is that because they're autistic themselves while making misogynistic comments and it grinds my gears the most that they use their autism to make such comments to avoid repercussions while I get double standards?) 

I came from the Philippines and I moved to the US right before high school and it baffles me how the most racist people in that school garnered a large social following that everyone just watched them throw food at me on the bus and I tried my hardest to not get violent because I was months from graduating, finally leaving that ghetto ass county and I was already threatened of getting sued and beaten in the Philippines (they didn't sue me but they had their kids beat me up as a way of ""atoning""). 

I'm sick of everyone. I never once fit in and the few friends I had were only out of convenience. I know I have a bad habit of overexplaining but I'm working my hardest on it while ashamed to admit how I've regressed from all the trauma I've been through, especially after I was finally out of the house. Even though I was a victim, it's hard to think of being one due to how I was consistently beaten that ""I'm never a victim"" especially with the blessings we received.

I admit my life turned a 180 when my step-dad dated my abusive mom. I went from living next to the slums to a gated townhouse when I was 7 but I was miserable growing up in that townhouse because the times my abusive mother was home, she'd beat me till my whole body's numb with either a belt or a wooden stick or stuff that she'd command me to get from her room and if I wasn't fast enough she'd throw that object (from combs to cutlery especially knives) and throw me out of the house on other nights and when I continued to cry, she'd yell for the guard half across the neighborhood to wake them up but the more people watched, the more I get beaten. It didn't matter whether we were at a mall or at home, at least behind closed doors, it's less humiliating but is it any wonder why I don't want to leave the house anymore? She and her family still wonders. 

I'm just done. I have to keep my schizo a secret to everyone who knows me because of how little they already see me being autistic and how ignorant the common denominator are with mental health, but every day I always feel like I'm losing a war and I'm scared of failing again only to be punished by getting 5150 again for losing control. 

Nobody understands me, what more cared because nobody ever tried to listen to anything I have to say unless it's something they want to hear YET I'm the bad person for walking out or why THEY fucking feel especially guilt. 

I'm just oversummarizing all the shit I've gone through at this point and it already reads like a dissertion now so I don't want to say any more of the shit even my therapists have told me seem ""too horrible to be true"". Idk English is my 2nd language and I was just lucky to learn it young because it was mandatory in my country's private catholic school. 
Idk I never want to hear or see the people from my life ever again but as I get older, I feel more left out because this world is just ableist af. I didn't just witness it from my upbringing but also having to watch how everyone treated my uncle with severe cerebral palsy.. I at least will try to make it for his 10yr death anniversary. 

 Even though I'll never be able to go back to the Philippines, I kept your tombstone in my memory because that was the first time I got to see your full name and birthday. You were the only one to stand up for me against your sister and I'll always carry with me the guilt and anger of not being able to be there for you more. Even though I've been to a handful of funerals growing up, it was your funeral the first time I felt.. different. At that time I didn't know what grief was despite thinking 17 meant I should be more mature..

At least when I'm gone, I managed to burn bridges with everyone, especially my abusive family because I know my narcissistic mother will never be satisfied until she buries me just like she did to my uncle, her own brother. 

If my abusive sister is reading this, if ever. Since not once did you ever wonder what more ask why I blocked you for 2 years? Because you blackmailed me about my abortions because your shitty parents couldn't talk to you like a normal person without yelling at US. Whether it's me or them, you always had a condescending tone yet you blamed ME for your childhood when everyone was at your beck and call, but I don't blame you because I was the family scapegoat while you were the golden child (i was the failure while you were the investment), everything that went wrong, it was all my fault. The fact that you took great offense of me just staring blankly as ""glaring at you like a pest"" didn't trigger me but telling me that ""mom has changed so much while you haven't because the past was the past"" just triggered me and in some ways, I'm thankful. I'm finally free. 

Honestly, I'm glad she probably won't be able to read this because she doesn't remember from her toddler years how our abusive mom laid her hand at her for wetting her bed because she was 3.. not once did I ever see my abusive mom help her with her potty training because she had me and Ellen (the maid) to do all the ""gross"" stuff she wouldn't do. Plus the times her parents fought alot especially when we just migrated to the US. But this is a few among others I'm taking with me to the grave.

 So last post. I was raised beside her more as her nanny than ""sister"" because what should my shitty mother know about siblings when she's the adopted one yet not once did she ever let her own brother sit on the same dining table with her.  My step-dad is sexist that he only really cared for his son while ""girls are just too much drama"" then wonders why no woman respects him because he's attracted to abusers. Sure he could've been worse but he nearly got arrested for being an ENABLER. So the fact they can still be smug just proves how perfect they are for each other. 


If I was such a ""liar"" then why the fuck did my own mother try to kill me especially more so during my adolescence ?  Not because she wants to bury all the shit I had to witness for her? All the shit she says behind everyone's back. Yet I'm the bad person for cutting myself off from my shitty family because not once did I even once think I was ""good"" because I was NEVER good enough for them. No. They always reminded me how I'm the worst pos that she wished she never gave birth to all because why? I was ""difficult""? Literally I had signs that I wasn't like most kids but I never saw that, instead she just reminded me that I was a failure. I only wanted to end the cycle of abuse that I tried to escape.

Tw. Just in case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly sick of being consistently invalidated because I&amp;#39;m either &amp;quot;too young&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m lying&amp;quot; especially of my difficult upbringing. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that even though I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with ASD, I&amp;#39;ve had people tell me off that I can&amp;#39;t be autistic because I&amp;#39;m not r* slur or I have &amp;quot;functioning&amp;quot; limbs said by normal people and some men on the spectrum (their reasoning is that because they&amp;#39;re autistic themselves while making misogynistic comments and it grinds my gears the most that they use their autism to make such comments to avoid repercussions while I get double standards?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came from the Philippines and I moved to the US right before high school and it baffles me how the most racist people in that school garnered a large social following that everyone just watched them throw food at me on the bus and I tried my hardest to not get violent because I was months from graduating, finally leaving that ghetto ass county and I was already threatened of getting sued and beaten in the Philippines (they didn&amp;#39;t sue me but they had their kids beat me up as a way of &amp;quot;atoning&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of everyone. I never once fit in and the few friends I had were only out of convenience. I know I have a bad habit of overexplaining but I&amp;#39;m working my hardest on it while ashamed to admit how I&amp;#39;ve regressed from all the trauma I&amp;#39;ve been through, especially after I was finally out of the house. Even though I was a victim, it&amp;#39;s hard to think of being one due to how I was consistently beaten that &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m never a victim&amp;quot; especially with the blessings we received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit my life turned a 180 when my step-dad dated my abusive mom. I went from living next to the slums to a gated townhouse when I was 7 but I was miserable growing up in that townhouse because the times my abusive mother was home, she&amp;#39;d beat me till my whole body&amp;#39;s numb with either a belt or a wooden stick or stuff that she&amp;#39;d command me to get from her room and if I wasn&amp;#39;t fast enough she&amp;#39;d throw that object (from combs to cutlery especially knives) and throw me out of the house on other nights and when I continued to cry, she&amp;#39;d yell for the guard half across the neighborhood to wake them up but the more people watched, the more I get beaten. It didn&amp;#39;t matter whether we were at a mall or at home, at least behind closed doors, it&amp;#39;s less humiliating but is it any wonder why I don&amp;#39;t want to leave the house anymore? She and her family still wonders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just done. I have to keep my schizo a secret to everyone who knows me because of how little they already see me being autistic and how ignorant the common denominator are with mental health, but every day I always feel like I&amp;#39;m losing a war and I&amp;#39;m scared of failing again only to be punished by getting 5150 again for losing control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody understands me, what more cared because nobody ever tried to listen to anything I have to say unless it&amp;#39;s something they want to hear YET I&amp;#39;m the bad person for walking out or why THEY fucking feel especially guilt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just oversummarizing all the shit I&amp;#39;ve gone through at this point and it already reads like a dissertion now so I don&amp;#39;t want to say any more of the shit even my therapists have told me seem &amp;quot;too horrible to be true&amp;quot;.

I'm 18, and have been feeling depressed for a long time, I can't remember if it started when I was 15 or 16. I hate myself. I hate people around me. I used to be a very hateful person part of the alt-right group and said very hateful things, but I believe my actions have tried to shed that past behind me. I just graduated high school, and now don't talk to anyone from my grade regularly. I maybe share a few texts with one every few weeks.

My 'best friend' James asked me if he could borrow one of my minecraft accounts so he could play with his girlfriend. Like the fucking idiot I am, I obliged and changed one of the passwords on an account to give it to him so he could give it to his girlfriend. I asked him if it worked, and I didn't get a response until 9 fucking hours later from him telling me it did. I was irritated at this and asked why it took him 9 hours to respond to something if the account worked or not if it obviously did since he has been playing with her the entire fucking day. He sheepishly replied that he didn't see the message, which I know is fucking bullshit because I have the same settings as him on discord and I get notified as soon as a message is sent to me. I continued my anger upon him, then apologize like a fucking idiot. I need to learn to stop apologizing for things that aren't my fault, I don't know why I apologize to try and fix relationships when I obviously don't matter to the other person. A week after this, he messages me about what browser he should use, and I ask him if he's saying this to try and make up for the minecraft account incident, and he says no he just wants my opinion, then goes to say it's getting late and he'll talk to me tomorrow. He never did. I know FOR A FUCKING FACT HE WILL SAY HE FORGOT BUT IF I FUCKING MATTERED AT ALL HE WOULDN'T FUCKING FORGET. I haven't talked to him since.

I am poor as fuck I bought a car in June with my dad, and little did we know it had transmission issues and now I need to sink in 1.5k+ for a new transmission, AFTER I SPENT 3.7k on the car, then I need to pay $450 towards car insurance, $150 towards my mom's birthday present, $400 towards my dad's birthday present, and I need to pay for my community college classes. Problem is, I only have enough money to sign up for one, and now my parents are going to fucking kill me because I will graduate later than expected. I fucking hate how such high expectations are set on me I want to fucking kill myself.

I recently just had a falling out with my friend group online that I play League of Legends with because I apparently set someone off. In this group, there is me, E, M, and H. We all poke fun at each other, but I feel as if I'm always the butt of everyone's jokes because I poke fun at a car accident I had when I was little, so H think she is entitled to poke fun at it too. I never let her know it bothered me, but I continued to poke fun at her by mocking her voice, and I pointed out when she kept asking her boyfriend, M, loaded questions like ""Would you still date me if 'X'?"" To me surprise, E and M AGREED with me, but it somehow set H off because later when me and M are talking about haircuts and how I recently got a buzzcut then H, in typical H fashion, begs for attention and tries to make it all about herself (she's done this before) and says ""Guys what do you think about my haircut?"" I say ""Oh my God can you please let us speak stop making everythi-"" then I get fucking kicked and removed from everything. Of course her boyfriend M is siding with her which makes no sense, but I can't tell if I'm gaslighting myself into believing I am the victim or if I was actually just rude to her, cus according to H and M, I was, which makes me feel worse about myself. I tried explaining to M that it wasn't my intention to come off as rude, but she can't make fun of my car accident then get so easily offended by me asking her to not interrupt me, but he says that I'm in the wrong because I made my car accident not seem like a big deal by poking fun at my own accident that happened when I was little, therefore making a joke out of it. Now I am going to lose the only other fucking people I talk to, and I so badly wish for someone to just shoot me in the fucking head.

,SuicideWatch,"I(M18) work at a retail store, it’s the kind of place that you can go hours without seeing anyone. I work entirely alone, no one but me runs the store, it gets very lonely and it’s recently been very mentally exhausting doing mundane tasks and having no human interaction.

Today I was pricing and putting out new clothes, it was a sweater of some kind, however it had this smell, the same smell my first serious girlfriend had. 

We dated for 5 years, most of middle school and half of high school. I loved her, and I guess I still do, but it’s not the same type of love anymore. We broke up 2 years ago, since then I’ve had other serious relationships, none of which have worked out. I no longer care for her too much, she changed a lot during our brake up and after. She was not the same girl I fell in love with. Before she dumped me she became toxic and started to give me trust issues. For weeks I would get anxiety about whether or not she loved me still, it affected me then, and it continues to affect me now and had an impact on my later relationships.

When I smelled that smell today, I smelled her. Her natural scent. It’s not a bad smell, just a uniquely recognizable one. It immediately brought me back to those days filled with anxiety and insecurity. Tears welled up in my eyes and my heart and mind were going a million miles an hour. A couple minutes later a customer walked in and I had to push my emotions away so I could muster a smile and a “welcome, How are you?… oh I’m doing great, thanks for asking, if you Need any help don’t be afraid to ask.” While they shopped I kept muttering under my breath for everything to stop and go away. It didn’t. When the customer left I locked myself in the bathroom for 15 minutes until I calmed down.

,SuicideWatch,"
So I just created a new account to post this even though none of my acquantances/friends actually ever followed me on reddit.

English is not my main language so excuse some errors here and there.

For privacy's sake I'll say I'm 20, rounding up or down some years, and I'm male.

I don't know when it started or why - my memory always seems to fog up faster than everyone else's - but my vision of the world was always a little sad.
Don't get me wrong when I was a kid I do kind of remember being happy, but I also remember opening the window that faced the street I was living on and telling my mum that if I wasn't enough as a kid maybe I shouldn't have been born (note: judging by some clues left behind in my memory I'd say this episode happened multiple, innumerous times since I was at least 7 or 8 years old)

I wouldn't say I was hated back in elementary school but I definitely was bullied back in middle school. Let's say I kind of got my shit together and pulled through patching things up here and there and almost enjoying my last year there.

High school was weird:
- I got a girlfriend
- I got my bestie (still going strong to this day)
- and I got absolutely destroyed in the process

Here's where I want to make one thing clear: I do consider myself to have friends, and these friends have sometimes shared intimate issues with me so I do feel like I was useful. Yet that's just it.

I only feel useful to others. I find my life to be completely void of meaning.
Every time I interact with someone I set myself up for exploitment. To be honest it's rather hilarious to think about but my spirit animal is probably a front porch rug - Just a flat surface that says ""welcome"" to clean your shoes and be forgotten about when it rains outside.

I broke up with my girlfriend right as covid struck. The relationship felt toxic to me and I felt like I was made a fool of.

I don't want to point my finger at her, may someone bless her soul and may I never see her again. The thing is everywhere I go I feel used and never fulfilled.

It all starts with me helping someone. The possibility of them relying on me for something is intoxicating. It feels as though that will validate me.

And I hate this perception of love I have. It makes me fall victim of so many unintentional exploits. I pass more time helping others than helping myself. And I don't even have a standard. I don't know if I'm bi or just crazy. But it's becoming unbearable.
I can't allow myself to be used by everyone and still have feelings for them after they don't even recognize my presence there.

I just see gray. I help others, get home, realize I'm not fulfilled, get forgotten, cry, wake up, repeat.

I keep waking up and checking my phone for messages that arent there.

I fall in love with everyone so I dont really fall in love with anyone. And nobody loves me, or likes me.

I'm sure my friends would go for weeks without realising I have passed. In a way I feel like I already have proof.

Every time I'm with someone I dissociate, it's just too painful to know you want to die when you're trying to be useful to someone.

And even though my will to live is zero I still commit myself to the burdens of others as if that is going to make me a different, better, saner person.

And so I go back to my bed. Wondering if I'm ever going to finish my studies before ending it all. Wondering if I'm ever going to go back to my psychologist as my bestie (who just knows part of this story) suggested. Telling myself I've done enough today when instead I feel like I'm just waste nobody deserves.

No one will miss me.
My parents are disappointed in every result I bring back home and never fail to make me notice.
I've got a wedding to attend to in some weeks so I've been holdin on as to not ruin it, but I don't know how long I can keep going just on inertia.

Haven't felt happy in so long I just know when I'm not feeling the sadness vs when I am.

tl;dr at the end.

i had suicidal thoughts for the majority of 2018-2020. around june of 2020, they started to go away and were almost completely gone until a few weeks ago. then i found out that my honorary sister was charged with multiple sex related felonies.

she knows how horribly it makes me feel to know that this shit happens; it's happened to her more than once, it's happened to my other friends, my coworkers, so so many people. however, she also knows i hate being lied to/having information hidden from me. now i feel i don't have a reason to live.

before i go on, trigger warning: gross sexual implication, pedophilia, statutory rape

this sister was a teacher at a high school. she taught two years there, no problem, right out of college. her third year, shit hit the fan. around the end of the school year, she began having sexual relations with a 17 year old student. it ended the day school ended for them. this stayed hidden for a while;  it happened in 2019 and stayed hidden til mid july of this year (about two weeks ago, july 13, 2022). i randomly got a text from her saying, ""i'm im big trouble. i fucked up bad and i don't know what to do."" cue panic. i begin grilling her, trying to figure out what happened. i find out from our mother (my blood, her ""adoption"") a week after about her relations with the student. i was sick.

it was bad enough knowing that not only did she do the thing she knows i hate more than anything at all, but she also hid it from me. but then she lied about the student's age, saying he was 18. still fucked and i was pissed, but i figured it wasn't technically illegal so i wouldn't have to worry about that.

fucking. nope.

i learned the kid was 17 at the time of their little affair via the news. a detective came to her house and she admitted to every accusation, and i'm afraid she's going to be imprisoned for a long time, possibly over 10 years. this is when i lost all hope and became suicidal again.

what was the point anymore? the one i basically devoted my life to (aside from my parents and blood sister) had committed numerous sex related felonies, hid it from me, and lied to me when i finally heard the ""truth."" then, to top it all off, even though i can forgive her (though trust me, it'll be a while), she's almost certainly going to prison. she's suffered enough for this dumbass mistake. she lost her job and is never gonna be able to teach again, she's gone through a whole lot of shit ever since the affair ended (her blood mother died, she was raped twice and repeatedly sexually harassed by someone with power over her) and i believe it's been beyond enough to atone for her bullshit. but, despite what i think, she's probably gonna be gone for a long time. and i don't want to live without her.

tl;dr: my ""soul sister"" was convicted of fucked up sex felonies and not only hid it from me but lied when i did find out. to top it all off, she's probably going to prison for a long time. i dont want to live without her. and because of that i don't want to live.

tl;dr at the end.

i had suicidal thoughts for the majority of 2018-2020. around june of 2020, they started to go away and were almost completely gone until a few weeks ago. then i found out that my honorary sister was charged with multiple sex related felonies.

she knows how horribly it makes me feel to know that this shit happens; it's happened to her more than once, it's happened to my other friends, my coworkers, so so many people. however, she also knows i hate being lied to/having information hidden from me. now i feel i don't have a reason to live.

before i go on, trigger warning: gross sexual implication, pedophilia, statutory rape

this sister was a teacher at a high school. she taught two years there, no problem, right out of college. her third year, shit hit the fan. around the end of the school year, she began having sexual relations with a 17 year old student. it ended the day school ended for them. this stayed hidden for a while;  it happened in 2019 and stayed hidden til mid july of this year (about two weeks ago, july 13, 2022). i randomly got a text from her saying, ""i'm im big trouble. i fucked up bad and i don't know what to do."" cue panic. i begin grilling her, trying to figure out what happened. i find out from our mother (my blood, her ""adoption"") a week after about her relations with the student. i was sick.

it was bad enough knowing that not only did she do the thing she knows i hate more than anything at all, but she also hid it from me. but then she lied about the student's age, saying he was 18. still fucked and i was pissed, but i figured it wasn't technically illegal so i wouldn't have to worry about that.

fucking. nope.

i learned the kid was 17 at the time of their little affair via the news. a detective came to her house and she admitted to every accusation, and i'm afraid she's going to be imprisoned for a long time, possibly over 10 years. this is when i lost all hope and became suicidal again.

what was the point anymore? the one i basically devoted my life to (aside from my parents and blood sister) had committed numerous sex related felonies, hid it from me, and lied to me when i finally heard the ""truth."" then, to top it all off, even though i can forgive her (though trust me, it'll be a while), she's almost certainly going to prison. she's suffered enough for this dumbass mistake. she lost her job and is never gonna be able to teach again, she's gone through a whole lot of shit ever since the affair ended (her blood mother died, she was raped twice and repeatedly sexually harassed by someone with power over her) and i believe it's been beyond enough to atone for her bullshit. but, despite what i think, she's probably gonna be gone for a long time. and i don't want to live without her.

tl;dr: my ""soul sister"" was convicted of fucked up sex felonies and not only hid it from me but lied when i did find out. to top it all off, she's probably going to prison for a long time. i dont want to live without her. and because of that i don't want to live.

,SuicideWatch,"My parents know that I’m depressed. Not suicidal. But “depressed”. Their very first snap reaction to me telling them was to say that it’s because I’m on my phone too much. Which is super funny. Actually. Eventually they let me know they would help me find a therapist. Still working on that. Hard to find one apparently,
So even though I’m *admittedly* in a very fragile mindset and experiencing dark thoughts, my parents will still tell me about every single thing I do and am that bothers them. Even though I’m struggling and some of the things are a direct result of that.
For example,  I did something that my mom found annoying, that my dad did as well. My mom never confronted him at all, told me that she was annoyed with him but “didn’t want to deal with him” so didn’t mention a word to him. But she laid into me. Even brought up that she doesn’t want to make me feel bad but felt like she needed to be heard by me anyway. I completely over reacted and broke down crying, which surprised her. And embarrassed her because we were driving to go pick someone up and now I was crying. I don’t know how she is surprised. I’m literaly, depressed. And not treated for it yet.
And tonight I was a little drunk and ended up admitting to my dad that him and my mom were the only things I was living for, the only things in my life that I was staying alive for. He had no reaction. Just kind of muttered about that being “stupid”, but no real reaction. Then changed the subject.
So I haven’t been sleeping. Like the past 4 weeks there have been 2-3 nights *every single week* that I haven’t slept a single hour. Just pulled all nighters entirely. And it’s really been dragging me down into some crazy darkness I’ve never seen before. I’ve told my parents this. In the past my doctor told me that if my sleeping issue gets worse that she is going to have to put me on some pretty serious sleeping meds. So tonight I let my dad know that I’ll probably be put on those in October when I go to the doctor. And he didn’t show any concern at all, all he showed was *annoyance*. He told me that if I worked really hard during the day then I would sleep just fine. I told him no…that’s not the case. I’m not sleeping in a much more extreme way than just, not being tired. He told me if I got up early and then worked the entire day and night that I would sleep just fine, I pointed out that last year for 8 months I worked 2 jobs, and would get up for 6am shifts and would work either til 9pm or 11pm, and still struggled with sleeping. Which he knew. And he huffed and asked if I did that for “20 years”? And…no I did it for 8 months. But I struggled sleeping. He huffed that I wouldn’t know until I did it for 20 years. By that logic I wouldn’t have any right to complain for a very long time. Since I’m 23 and have only legally began able to work since I was 16. So, about 8 years I’ve ever even been able to work. Maybe he’ll take me seriously when I’m 36? I told him that I always ended up regretting telling him the things I struggled with because he always found a way to downplay them or make them my fault. And he walked away and went to sleep.
I really truly wonder if I took my life in this bedroom and they found me tomorrow would they wonder if they were somewhat at fault for not taking me seriously, or would they act as if they had no clue I was struggling. If they would regret snapping at me for stupid things. For hearing that I’m not sleeping and not caring.

,SuicideWatch,"I can walk up to anybody. Anybody at all in my life, tell them that I want to kill myself with fully sincerity… and they.. will… not… do …. Anything :)

I can post on my Snapchat/Instagram story to 100+ people. A picture of me looking like shit, directly saying I want to kill my self.. and nobody.. will say..anything :)

I can go to therapy, talk to a therapist sure.. But nobody want to hear me talk about my “bad experiences in therapy” and they insist there are better ones out there without fully understanding the hurt that comes alone with breaking that trust..

It’s like I’m a second-thought to everyone.. people hear that I have a problem and they deflect it as soon as they can onto someone else.. nobody cares about me.. why should I?

I keep thinking about killing myself, but I’m not sure I even want to… I want help and to get better.. but I don’t even know what “better” is… I’m so misguided and poorly raised... I feel like I’ll never survive on my own unless I fix this stuff as soon as possible.. 

I can’t do it alone anymore.. I’ve already went through my trauma alone..

CW: CSA, violence, pedophilia

I'm 22m and have been depressed and suicidal since I was around 12 years old but have had anxiety since I was very young. I've known I would be the one to take my life as long as I can remember.

I'm not sure when but when I was probably around 5 or 6 I was sexually assaulted by a few teenage girls which I never told anyone about and seems to have left me with serious issues.

I remember seeing bras at the store and wanting them for some sexual reason I didn't understand because I had no clue what sex even was. Everything about it seemed to interest me though. I remember my parents watching a crime show and there being a girl who was abducted and tortured and something about it seemed to excite young me.

I wound up discovering porn on the internet around middle school and quickly became obsessed with it. I don't know if it's a normal reaction for most children but I wanted to know what my peers looked like naked or having sex and searched often for that type of content. Thankfully I never found anything.

Unfortunately though I never seemed to grow out of that interest and still the idea of seeing a minor sexually interests me. I feel disgusting for it and know that it's wrong. I tried sating my desires for it with fictional depictions but never felt truly satisfied. I hope I would never act on it but I'm always fearful of losing control of my mind.

Recently my thoughts have become more violent too as my brain struggles to cope and deal with complex emotions. Girls make me feel angry a lot of the time. A mix of jealousy that other people can have sex with them and that they get to look so cute and attractive. Recently I've fantasized about even taking the lives of some of these girls.

I don't even know what I'm writing anymore. I just need to get things out of my head. It's hell being stuck in here and I just want this to be over.

,SuicideWatch,"I want to die so, so badly. I've been plagued with mental illness my entire life one way or another---I had severe OCD as a kid, which ruined my childhood. All I could think about were rituals, how I could avoid certain things, and how to hide my compulsions. That eased up when I got older, but I've always been deeply depressed. Four years ago, I developed PMDD, which is PMS x100. Every month, I feel hopeless, suicidal, anxious, I'm angry, I'm impatient (the last two qualities are not a normal part of my personality). Im pretty sure I lost some friendships because of my deep depression. I'm lonely as fuck. Last year, my boyfriend, who I lived with, broke up with me because I gained weight during the pandemic. He was so fucking mean to me after he broke up with me. We lived together for a month after, while he was looking for a place. And he treated me like shit. He also went on dates off of dating apps while still living with me. And I was still in love with him (I'm definitely not now). He thinks I don't know. He got into a new relationship three months later and he looks so happy in pictures he's posted on instagram with her (I've since blocked him). That hurts because I remember being sad he didn't post any pictures on instagram of me when we were together. People always bring up ""karma"", but it's not real. If it was, he would be miserable, for what he put me through (some of which I didn't mention here), and I'd be in a happy relationship.I ended up losing almost 30 pounds last year, after he broke up with me. But a doctor had me go on birth control to help my PMDD and I gained it all back last November. I'm having trouble losing it again.  I don't want him to know anything about my life because I'm so fucking lonely and I weigh the same now as I did when he broke up with me. I feel so pathetic. 

After that, I essentially lived alone for months. My parents very kindly bought a place where I live so I could rent from them---I had to move three times in three years, the first place was because my landlord was selling the place so I had to leave, which I had a hard time with because mentally, I can't take instability. I pay them market price for rent, more than I've ever paid for rent. It's not a free ride, which is totally fine. They bought a two bedroom because living alone makes me suicidal. I was so excited to get a roommate and have someone to talk to sometimes. But I ended up with this guy who I cannot connect with at all (and I call strangers for my job all the time---not a telemarketer---I'm good at talking to all sorts of people). It's just so awkward when we interact, and he's gone a lot anyway. I'm extremely resentful of him, especially because he makes these odd noise complaints--I had to work on a Sunday so I microwaved oatmeal at 6am, and because it was his day off, he came out and complained----I opened the door before it went off and made sure to be quiet. He leaves at 6am on weekdays for work, but I don't complain because I have a roommate who needs to live their life too. I had to watch a tv show and take notes on it for work and I was in the living room at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and he TEXTS me, from the next room, to turn the tv down. It wasn't on loud---the narrator was louder than everyone else so I had to turn it up a bit. A few hours later I apologized (not sure why, its a reflex) and he said ""I realized that maybe the noise was coming from the pool area"". He didn't apologize, and if I didn't send that text, he probably would never have admitted the pool thing. I'm not a loud roommate in the least bit, but he'll incessantly use the washer and dryer---a few weeks ago, the dryer going off woke me up at 3am.

 But honestly, if he did all that and we actually had a friendship and talked some times, none of that would matter to me. I can't ask him to leave without anyone else lined up because my mom will yell at me and guilt me, like she always has. But his presence is making me depressed as fuck. I resent him because I wish this spot was filled by someone I could talk to sometimes. I work from home, which is isolating, so I'm alone all day and all evening every day. 

This is honestly just a little bit of why I'm depressed. If I wrote everything, it would take up more than the character limit, I'm certain. I had two grandparents die in less than a year, I was sexually assaulted last year, a guy I liked a lot, who I met last October and had regular contact with, told me he didn't want to hook up anymore, and wanted to be friends without benefits, which was shitty but okay, I have to accept that. He hasn't texted me for more than a month now though. A lot of my friends moved away during the pandemic. It's been harder for me to leave the house after the pandemic, psychologically. I don't know how to make new friends here. The PMDD is actively killing me. I tried to kill myself last year because of it. I don't have any control over anything, but I'm fully aware its happening. It's like this person who isn't me is in my body with me, and they're making decisions and saying things, and they're much stronger than me so I can't fight them. 

If I just had someone I could actually have a household with and sometimes maybe we can watch a movie or cook dinner together, I feel like that would help. I don't need them to be with me 24/7. I like and need alone time. But this is too much alone time, and it's genuinely driven me insane. 

I know this all pales in comparison with what other people have to deal with, which makes me feel like an asshole. I tried so fucking hard to fix everything in my life after it fell apart during the pandemic, and I essentially have made no progress. I wish people in my life knew how fucking hard I've tried.

I just want to be free from my fucked up brain. I'm so fucking frustrated that nothing has gotten better in over a year, even though I tried SO hard to make it better.

I&amp;#39;ve been plagued with mental illness my entire life one way or another---I had severe OCD as a kid, which ruined my childhood. All I could think about were rituals, how I could avoid certain things, and how to hide my compulsions. That eased up when I got older, but I&amp;#39;ve always been deeply depressed. Four years ago, I developed PMDD, which is PMS x100. Every month, I feel hopeless, suicidal, anxious, I&amp;#39;m angry, I&amp;#39;m impatient (the last two qualities are not a normal part of my personality). Im pretty sure I lost some friendships because of my deep depression. I&amp;#39;m lonely as fuck. Last year, my boyfriend, who I lived with, broke up with me because I gained weight during the pandemic. He was so fucking mean to me after he broke up with me. We lived together for a month after, while he was looking for a place. And he treated me like shit. He also went on dates off of dating apps while still living with me. And I was still in love with him (I&amp;#39;m definitely not now). He thinks I don&amp;#39;t know. He got into a new relationship three months later and he looks so happy in pictures he&amp;#39;s posted on instagram with her (I&amp;#39;ve since blocked him). That hurts because I remember being sad he didn&amp;#39;t post any pictures on instagram of me when we were together. People always bring up &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s not real. If it was, he would be miserable, for what he put me through (some of which I didn&amp;#39;t mention here), and I&amp;#39;d be in a happy relationship.I ended up losing almost 30 pounds last year, after he broke up with me. But a doctor had me go on birth control to help my PMDD and I gained it all back last November. I&amp;#39;m having trouble losing it again.  I don&amp;#39;t want him to know anything about my life because I&amp;#39;m so fucking lonely and I weigh the same now as I did when he broke up with me. I feel so pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I essentially lived alone for months. My parents very kindly bought a place where I live so I could rent from them---I had to move three times in three years, the first place was because my landlord was selling the place so I had to leave, which I had a hard time with because mentally, I can&amp;#39;t take instability. I pay them market price for rent, more than I&amp;#39;ve ever paid for rent. It&amp;#39;s not a free ride, which is totally fine. They bought a two bedroom because living alone makes me suicidal. I was so excited to get a roommate and have someone to talk to sometimes. But I ended up with this guy who I cannot connect with at all (and I call strangers for my job all the time---not a telemarketer---I&amp;#39;m good at talking to all sorts of people). It&amp;#39;s just so awkward when we interact, and he&amp;#39;s gone a lot anyway. I&amp;#39;m extremely resentful of him, especially because he makes these odd noise complaints--I had to work on a Sunday so I microwaved oatmeal at 6am, and because it was his day off, he came out and complained----I opened the door before it went off and made sure to be quiet. He leaves at 6am on weekdays for work, but I don&amp;#39;t complain because I have a roommate who needs to live their life too. I had to watch a tv show and take notes on it for work and I was in the living room at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and he TEXTS me, from the next room, to turn the tv down. It wasn&amp;#39;t on loud---the narrator was louder than everyone else so I had to turn it up a bit. A few hours later I apologized (not sure why, its a reflex) and he said &amp;quot;I realized that maybe the noise was coming from the pool area&amp;quot;. He didn&amp;#39;t apologize, and if I didn&amp;#39;t send that text, he probably would never have admitted the pool thing. I&amp;#39;m not a loud roommate in the least bit, but he&amp;#39;ll incessantly use the washer and dryer---a few weeks ago, the dryer going off woke me up at 3am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly, if he did all that and we actually had a friendship and talked some times, none of that would matter to me. I can&amp;#39;t ask him to leave without anyone else lined up because my mom will yell at me and guilt me, like she always has. But his presence is making me depressed as fuck. I resent him because I wish this spot was filled by someone I could talk to sometimes. I work from home, which is isolating, so I&amp;#39;m alone all day and all evening every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is honestly just a little bit of why I&amp;#39;m depressed. If I wrote everything, it would take up more than the character limit, I&amp;#39;m certain. I had two grandparents die in less than a year, I was sexually assaulted last year, a guy I liked a lot, who I met last October and had regular contact with, told me he didn&amp;#39;t want to hook up anymore, and wanted to be friends without benefits, which was shitty but okay, I have to accept that. He hasn&amp;#39;t texted me for more than a month now though. A lot of my friends moved away during the pandemic. It&amp;#39;s been harder for me to leave the house after the pandemic, psychologically. I don&amp;#39;t know how to make new friends here. The PMDD is actively killing me. I tried to kill myself last year because of it. I don&amp;#39;t have any control over anything, but I&amp;#39;m fully aware its happening. It&amp;#39;s like this person who isn&amp;#39;t me is in my body with me, and they&amp;#39;re making decisions and saying things, and they&amp;#39;re much stronger than me so I can&amp;#39;t fight them. &lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t need them to be with me 24/7. I like and need alone time. But this is too much alone time, and it&amp;#39;s genuinely driven me insane. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This might be long, sorry I just need to get my thoughts out somewhere

A lot of my family have died and I’m still pretty young, the remaining people are getting old or are ill so I guess I’ve always figured I’ll just end it when they’re gone, but right now I’m feeling like I can’t wait

I live with my ex and for a year we’ve gotten on well like that, but I’m pretty sure they’re moving on and that’s ok that’s what exs do but I have BPD and it’s just hurting me

I’ve tried to grow and be a good person I just know deep down that I’m not. I’ve hurt people with what I say. I’m generally seen as mean and standoffish so I don’t have many friends. It never bothered me much because I’ve always had this vague notion that I’d kill myself at some point.

I attempted before but I was young and it didn’t work. People say it was a “cry for help” which I guess at least it did get me help for while but that wasn’t what I wanted, I just wanted to be gone. Therapy and meds have never fully worked for me. I’m so jealous of people who say it’s “life changing”

I don’t want to be seen as attention seeking or crying for help. I don’t want any attention I just want to be gone. But I know it will break my few family members, they’ve already had so many deaths and tragedies. I know they’re old and I could just wait, but lately it’s all I think about. I guess that’s why I’m posting here, I just want to feel heard but I can’t burden these people with it, I don’t want to scare them. 

Tried calling the samaritans and honestly it wasn’t great, they kinda just listened which I guess is what they’re for, but it felt very one sided and then they kinda ended the call after a while, felt like they wanted to get rid of me.

I’m on new meds and they seem to be making it worse, I can’t even cry I just constantly think about ending it. I was going to do it tonight but I couldn’t find a good location. I don’t want anyone to find me.

,SuicideWatch,"Edit: I should add…I was very social as a child but because of my emotionally abusive and neglectful home, my social skills got hurt pretty badly. So I missed many opportunities during high school and general teen years. And college. Crucial opportunities. It’s not just about “never having sex”. I also do care about a lot of other things in life.

M 22

Do not tell me 22 is young. Have some empathy. I’ve been a romantic and sexual person since late elementary school. Then it was ripped away from me by me being forced to live in a emotionally abusive and neglectful home (and some other reasons). I went through 4 years of high school and 4 years of college and I’ve never been in a relationship nor had any sexual experiences. And I had to watch everyone else get those experiences. It’s so alienating and disorienting. It’s extremely painful. I’m extremely touch starved.

Throughout all of human history, the vast majority of teenagers become sexual with each other. And now I will never have that experience. It’s different when you’re a teenager and you can experiment. It’s a different experience, and now it’s forever gone.

Now for the rest of my life, I’m going to be labeled as a late bloomer. I don’t want to be a late fucking bloomer. Even if I get these experiences in the future, I am still forever going to be the person who went through his teen years and 4 years of college without even having kissed someone. Or being in a relationship. I want to be a person who has had sexual and romantic experiences as a teenager. But I can’t. And I’d rather kill myself than go through life without those experiences.

Just look at this post/comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/wg3l2w/sometimes_im_silenced_by_the_things_my_daughter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Talking about how teens are horny and will always find a way to fuck. It’s true. I can’t relate to anything in that thread and I NEVER WILL. I don’t want to live that life.

Now look at this: https://t.snapchat.com/t1ikZY0J

Yeah just twist the knife. I have to look at actual teens who are dating talk about their sexual relationships. I WILL NEVER relate to this. I want to kill myself just thinking about it. It’s so normalized that teens have sex, yet here I am at 22 and I know nothing of what it’s like.

And before you tell me that this is just the internet, please educate yourself on the actual rate of relationships and sex among teenagers. Also I have my own experience seeing all the kids I went to grade school with have these experiences.

&lt;p&gt;Nobody is even going to fucking respond to this post lmao&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and hopefully you clicked on the links.&lt;/p&gt;

I am done running. Life takes too much than it gives. I don't understand why should I stay. We are all going to die anyway, then why struggle until you die naturally?

I need to join in a month and it's killing me that I have no choice but go. I am broke and the job is 'pretty good' according to friends and family.

So guess what? I am done. Life isn't beautiful and it isn't free. If I need to work that much just to afford a living, fuck it I don't want it.

I have a 15 storey building near me and that's where I am jumping from. I hope I don't survive.

,SuicideWatch,My friend 22F is currently on the brink of being homeless and is expressing she is suicidal. I 23F was forced to move back in with my mom who is judgmental and has bpd. I am currently looking to move out as soon as possible but I just began working a job and am trying to get out of a financial crisis. My friend has been unemployed for a while now and had been living with her boyfriend. They have been fighting and he basically told her to get out which has sent her spiraling. I have tried to be as supportive as I can with the little that I have. She is now making it clear that she no longer wants to exist. I have tried to help brainstorm places she could go including living with family and she expresses this is a hard no. I have struggled with my own mental health and my mom has not been the best at being supportive so I’m afraid that she will offend my friend and that it will impact her negatively.

I am currently looking to move out as soon as possible but I just began working a job and am trying to get out of a financial crisis. My friend has been unemployed for a while now and had been living with her boyfriend. They have been fighting and he basically told her to get out which has sent her spiraling. I have tried to be as supportive as I can with the little that I have. She is now making it clear that she no longer wants to exist. I have tried to help brainstorm places she could go including living with family and she expresses this is a hard no.

3 months clean down the drain has really made me think.

I don’t know why cutting is such a looked down upon method of self harm. Smoking and drinking yourself away are just as bad. And you could do both of them in public without a single person batting an eye. Cutting though- it’s like suddenly, almost everybody cares. 

For me, my cuts are a reminder that i can feel pain- physically, not just mentally. They are a tangible way that I can look at the cuts on the inside of me. *Deep* cuts in my mind, my heart, my being. It’s not something melancholic. I don't want people to feel bad for me if they happen to see them. They’re just reminders that I’m *alive*. 

Same as starving myself. The feeling I get when I haven't eaten in days grounds me to this earth. It's what keeps me going. I can't help but think that if I stop- if I somehow stop feeling the bite of the knife and the emptiness in my stomach that I won't be able to handle being without them.

I just want this to end. All of it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for over half my life now. I’ll be 27 soon, and I’m not entirely sure I want to keep going. I’ve had so many various ups and downs, some of them rather extreme in nature, but I’ve always bounced back and am in fact still living.

I don’t like the idea of continuing to live. Every bond I make with someone ends up breaking, and life without others to share it with is just hollow, and sad. A cold and colourless existence.

I’ve had to struggle for most of my life, but now I feel like all of it seems to have amounted to nothing of value to anyone but myself, and to me, myself is not something worth valuing.

In all honesty, I’ll likely be taking my life as a 27th birthday present to myself. I am so, so very tired. I just want to sleep.

I won’t be reading comments on this post, so argue amongst yourselves if you must, but I do have a message for others suffering a similar existence.

Don’t give up like I have. Please keep fighting. It’s a colossal fucking pain in the ass, but it will be worth it for you to struggle and come out the other end as a better person.

I’ll be 27 soon, and I’m not entirely sure I want to keep going. I’ve had so many various ups and downs, some of them rather extreme in nature, but I’ve always bounced back and am in fact still living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like the idea of continuing to live. Every bond I make with someone ends up breaking, and life without others to share it with is just hollow, and sad. A cold and colourless existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to struggle for most of my life, but now I feel like all of it seems to have amounted to nothing of value to anyone but myself, and to me, myself is not something worth valuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I’ll likely be taking my life as a 27th birthday present to myself. I am so, so very tired. I just want to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t be reading comments on this post, so argue amongst yourselves if you must, but I do have a message for others suffering a similar existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t give up like I have. Please keep fighting. It’s a colossal fucking pain in the ass, but it will be worth it for you to struggle and come out the other end as a better person.

If. But this is unattainable at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, on the other hand, I can just end it right now and that&amp;#39;s it, eternal oblivion. Why to endure all this if I can end it right now and free myself of all my suffering? What&amp;#39;s the point? We all will die some day. It&amp;#39;s inevitable. We are just programmed so, me myself, that we should live on. The only reason that stopped me from this hitherto is my defeat. That all around me, my relatives, coworkers, all the people who know me will know my defeat, no other way. That they won, me — defeated. This I cannot endure. Even after my death, when I won&amp;#39;t be able to feel anything, when there won&amp;#39;t be any of me. And the only reason avoiding this is as of yet I don&amp;#39;t know the way to just disappear that anyone else not know of my dying.&lt;/p&gt;

I realised I was an incel 4 years ago and my mental state gets worse and worse each year. I have been led on for attention by some girls in the past, been so close yet bad luck happens and the worst of all something catastrophic happened to me in February this year. I lost the one woman who actually seemed to give a shit about me. This woman was amazing she was actually an 8/10 and I couldn’t believe my luck. She showed she cared and was concerned about how I never ate food. We dated then my insecurity of her ex 6’4 29 year old good looking boyfriend made me feel inadequate and the incel beliefs told me that she is ‘alpha widowed’ which means he will always be the best she ever had. Not me. I had sex with her for 7 seconds but my dick went soft due to my nerves and compulsive porn addiction. Then I went on to blow the chance and end up getting blocked by her. 

After this rejection I went further into the incel space. I continued to lose weight and the worse of all I became misogynistic and envious of women. I got jealous because I saw how every woman had men willing to have sex and intimacy with them: something I was deprived of. I also saw how women are in such high demand and felt inferior to them. I also hated how some men paid for everything in the relationship and took it in a way where I feel like women live life on easy mode (obviously I understand even with this help, life probably isn’t easy for even them as life can be shit to anyone) but I feel like if I was a woman life would be a lot better.  Luckily I am not a terrible dude. I keep to myself and dont want to be the typical hateful incel to kill innocent people. I just want myself to leave the world. 

Back to dating. My dating life would improve if I had a big dick, was 6’4, black (I feel like black men are the most sexiest to women), good looking, and had money. I know less than 1% of men are this man but I feel like thats what you need to have a good dating life as a man. Sure missing one of these traits wont mean its over. But in my situation being average it is over.

,SuicideWatch,"I have been living abroad for four years, with a major focus on developing my career. Now I am 25, and I have realized that my life is empty: a lot of my old friendships are getting colder and more distant; I am a different person now and I feel that I don't have that much in common with my old friends as well as with most of my family members anymore.

My life is like a race against the clock, I don't enjoy my days anymore: it's just working. I am a freelance model, therefore I've been traveling for work constantly this year, without a real break. Whenever I wanted to take part in social events, I couldn't because I had to work or recover from physical and mental tiredness.

I'm going to start a new life in Milan next month: I'm going to attend one of the best universities in town, living on my own completely in a nice one-bedroom apartment in the historical center, but I don't feel excited anymore. I am not excited about going out anymore, I don't like eating anymore, I can't find anything interesting in many people anymore...everything is disconnected and irrelevant to me. I am going on holiday to one of the most beautiful and posh places in Tuscany this month, but I still feel stressed out about my job and life.

Then I accidentally fell in love. 

Now that's all been destroyed and here I am alone again. Even more lost and isolated and confused and broken than before, as if that was possible. But I know she'll blame herself. There's no way I could possibly make her understand that I'm not doing it because of what she did. I'm just... Going back to what I was doing before she came along.

In a way i don't blame her for doing what she did, i wasn't really there emotionally just because im autistic, and i have been working suppepr extra hard for the lsst 6 months just to save up money so we can move in together. 
I feel like i have been living for her for the last 5 years and i hadn't really had a personal life. 
I was so broken after she came to pick some of her stuff up that i was ready to die, and there is no day it goes by where i don't think of suicide. 
When i was with her i had no friends apart from her( my choice).
Now for the first time in a long time i went to a pub with an old friend that i started talking again and we ended up in her bed. 
It was the best sex i had in a long time but my heart wasn't in it, i just wanted to scream and cry. (I wasn't drunk, i dont drink alcohol) 
Now me and her have been talking for a week and i got the feeling that she's getting feelings for me, witch we talked about and i said to her not to, because its not worth it. Me and her know each other for years and we had fun in the past when both of us are single.
I would of forgave my ex for all shes done just because i really on her being there so much that i really don't know how to live without her. 
She told a family member that she still loves me but she can't forgive herself for what she did.
Im just sitting here contemplating on life and the only thing that i can think of is suicide( tried it twice in the past before i met her) but what is there to stop me now?
I can't feel symphony for others, i know that they will be fine without me. 
I don't know what im doing, im lost and scared and i thik that this might be a goodbye to the world;
Thank you for reading about me and i do hope that you are in a better place;

,SuicideWatch," 

Hello  , I am 24 years old. Since my last depression was greatly reduced by  JP. and After all Psychiatrist help did not work. I have come to this  sub and possibly get a view from you people.

A  short story of my life  is after failing the first try on uni and  realizing my 10 years of league of legends playing did not gave me any  openings because i was bad at it. I have lost all my ego or trust in  myself. Even though i had heavy ADHD i have pushed myself through and  tried again. after failing to go into a good universty in my country . I  went into an offshore uni where i did not learn anything and lived in  poverty. After coming back into my country found a job thanks to a  family connection while working i have found out i had kidney failure on  both my kidneys. But i have believed in myself and work through it with  high medication. I had a stable life where i studied went to gym and  worked. After a year the medication ( Cortisone ) caused both of my legs  to get  Avascular Necrosis.on top of that i have developed a gaut and  as a Man who did not liked to eat any veggies and possibly throw up if i  ate it. Now i am pushed to a severe diet. Following After a 6 months of  surgery and recovery time i have lost my job and i got advised to not  lift any weights. Please do understand that i am not a hot male i and i  have an upcoming 3    [skin tag](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/skin%20tag)  on my face . So now that i have no jobs no skills qualified and no  natural beauty standards. I have  a very hard future that is awaiting.  On this point in my life  all of my trumps has failed and i just left a  24 years of failure behind.  I did promised myself at age 18 that i  would kms if i did not improve on life . Now that 6 years past and got  no kind of advancements in life and only worse medical status . i am  contemplating the only option. I have no future that is awaiting for me  that can make me happy nor i have any kind of dreams or options that can  make me smile. Even if i magically turned into a millionaire and got  new [kidneys.](https://kidneys.got/)   With an existing gaut and Surgecially  weakened legs i do not be using  any of my money to do things that i like. so far any things i liked is  a)turned into a severe failiure/ realised that i had no skill and passed  my prime age of doing it.   b) now due to my medical status i am not  allowed/can't do.

I  have speak this about my family and total of 1 friend but they both  couldn't said anything and just said ""cmon don't do it"" as the doctors i  have went. No one gave me a good option, hope etc. The only realistic  approach was ""you have to realize your positive things and live a life  happy with what you got"" which does not stand in any way shape or  form.Due to me not loving the idea of a ""failure who is born to fail  living in poverty with weak health status""  Since the future that awaits  after my family dies. Is an ugly, alone out of shape dude who can't  even lift/run/jump that lives so he can go to dialyses. Even if i had  these  options i would not be gaining any muscles due to kidney  failiure. And since i do live In a 3rd world country where my life means  nothing. I do not wish to continue.

Since my last depression was greatly reduced by  JP. and After all Psychiatrist help did not work. I have come to this  sub and possibly get a view from you people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A  short story of my life  is after failing the first try on uni and  realizing my 10 years of league of legends playing did not gave me any  openings because i was bad at it. I have lost all my ego or trust in  myself. Even though i had heavy ADHD i have pushed myself through and  tried again. after failing to go into a good universty in my country . I  went into an offshore uni where i did not learn anything and lived in  poverty. After coming back into my country found a job thanks to a  family connection while working i have found out i had kidney failure on  both my kidneys. But i have believed in myself and work through it with  high medication. I had a stable life where i studied went to gym and  worked. After a year the medication ( Cortisone ) caused both of my legs  to get  Avascular Necrosis.on top of that i have developed a gaut and  as a Man who did not liked to eat any veggies and possibly throw up if i  ate it. Now i am pushed to a severe diet. Following After a 6 months of  surgery and recovery time i have lost my job and i got advised to not  lift any weights. Please do understand that i am not a hot male i and i  have an upcoming 3    &lt;a href=""https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/skin%20tag""&gt;skin tag&lt;/a&gt;  on my face . So now that i have no jobs no skills qualified and no  natural beauty standards. I have  a very hard future that is awaiting.  On this point in my life  all of my trumps has failed and i just left a  24 years of failure behind.  I did promised myself at age 18 that i  would kms if i did not improve on life . Now that 6 years past and got  no kind of advancements in life and only worse medical status . i am  contemplating the only option. I have no future that is awaiting for me  that can make me happy nor i have any kind of dreams or options that can  make me smile. Even if i magically turned into a millionaire and got  new &lt;a href=""https://kidneys.got/""&gt;kidneys.&lt;/a&gt;   With an existing gaut and Surgecially  weakened legs i do not be using  any of my money to do things that i like. so far any things i liked is  a)turned into a severe failiure/ realised that i had no skill and passed  my prime age of doing it.   b) now due to my medical status i am not  allowed/can&amp;#39;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  have speak this about my family and total of 1 friend but they both  couldn&amp;#39;t said anything and just said &amp;quot;cmon don&amp;#39;t do it&amp;quot; as the doctors i  have went. No one gave me a good option, hope etc. The only realistic  approach was &amp;quot;you have to realize your positive things and live a life  happy with what you got&amp;quot; which does not stand in any way shape or  form.Due to me not loving the idea of a &amp;quot;failure who is born to fail  living in poverty with weak health status&amp;quot;  Since the future that awaits  after my family dies. Is an ugly, alone out of shape dude who can&amp;#39;t  even lift/run/jump that lives so he can go to dialyses. Even if i had  these  options i would not be gaining any muscles due to kidney  failiure. And since i do live In a 3rd world country where my life means  nothing. I do not wish to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can you give me your opinion. Why shouldn&amp;#39;t i ? or What would you do in my condition ?&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I wrote/currently writing a really long one, like basically just a summary of all the reasons I want to die and why I'm killing myself

I have a muslim arab family who I don't have any sort of relationship with (and would never want to), and the idea of writing one ""in real life"" is out of the window for many reasons. 

This past year has been the hardest year of my life and every freaking day feels like it's my last. Each second I live feels like I'm getting closer and closer to ending it all. And the idea of writing a ""suicide note"" (or anything similar to one) has always just been something I WISHED I could do. Because my entire life I've always just daydreamed of venting to someone about all the reasons I wanna die, and the things I wished I could say before I die, and how much I hate this world and why. But I have SO many reasons, like basically an infinite amount, so realistically I never thought of writing one.

But since I'm really really ready to just end it all, I said screw it who cares. Because even though I definitely won't express myself correctly or even fit 5 percent of the reasons I wanna die, I'm gonna be dead anyway. So why does it matter. 

Also the text is really long. Like realistically over 100 thousand characters

So yeah basically I don't know what to do with it. Help please. I don't know what to do


This is an edit but literally  neevr fucking mind. 50% of teh stuff on there is kind of political and 40% of it is why I hate people and hate this world. And peopel are gonna read it?? Makes no sense Nobody will relate or even understand me and knowing how much im fixating or eveyry little thing scared of how im saying it because I feel embarrassed maybe i shouldnt show it to anyone in the first place. I told my family im ex muslim and this ""suicide note"" thatsbasically like a mini diary i showed to my aunt and dad to try and convince them into not calling the mental hospital people thing idfk what theyre called which didnt even work and now i am quite literally stuck so even in a hypothetical situation i didnt wanna die im gonna die anyway.

&lt;p&gt;But since I&amp;#39;m really really ready to just end it all, I said screw it who cares. Because even though I definitely won&amp;#39;t express myself correctly or even fit 5 percent of the reasons I wanna die, I&amp;#39;m gonna be dead anyway. So why does it matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the text is really long. Like realistically over 100 thousand characters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah basically I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with it. Help please. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an edit but literally  neevr fucking mind. 50% of teh stuff on there is kind of political and 40% of it is why I hate people and hate this world. And peopel are gonna read it?? Makes no sense Nobody will relate or even understand me and knowing how much im fixating or eveyry little thing scared of how im saying it because I feel embarrassed maybe i shouldnt show it to anyone in the first place. I told my family im ex muslim and this &amp;quot;suicide note&amp;quot; thatsbasically like a mini diary i showed to my aunt and dad to try and convince them into not calling the mental hospital people thing idfk what theyre called which didnt even work and now i am quite literally stuck so even in a hypothetical situation i didnt wanna die im gonna die anyway. I havent drank water in two or three days idk at this point cuz i havent slept and in three days max ill be dead. I cant risk any other methods os dying. I fucking hate this world so much i hate everyone and everything. This world is not my place. I was born in the wrong time and wrong place. I was never meant to live. I was born as a human to be dehumanized. I fucking hate this world so mich&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I made a previous post here 2-3 years ago I'm currently 16 in that time my life has changed so much and not for the better, I've gone to rehab a little over a year ago due to my drug use (Nothing more than weed/pot/marijuana and the occasional drink) and in my time there I've realized so much about myself people there help me realize that yes drugs aren't the answer to not having to deal with my problems, I still have a lot of passive suicidal thoughts but recently (The past year and a half) I've had more and more active suicidal thoughts. 

For some back story 
My father has always been abusive physically and mentally when I was about 7-9ish CPS got involved nothing came of that but he did finally stop not because CPS because although we live in the US my fathers side of the family comes from Laos around the time of Vietnam, and they are very respected in there community and he stopped because of the repercussions that having his kids taken from him would have but he is still emotionally abusive along with my mother.

My father has lied about the abuse to CPS my family friends, my mother gaslights or tries to tell me that I always deflect the blame(For anything) onto my father because i mention his abuse in arguments and trying to get her to see how much that has affected my life. I have now realized even as a 3rd grader i suffered from severe depression/anxiety.

But more recently me and my father had a fight that stemmed from me arguing with my sister, I called him out for not doing anything beyond going to work 7-5 while my mother also works a fulltime job and doing all the house work along with me and my 2 younger siblings (15,13) I have 2 other siblings but they are 8 and 5-6, but my father complains when nothing is done and how it stresses him and my mom out while he sits on his ass and does nothing, I also go to school, have a part time job all year round and most of the time I could go to school, come home and have less than 20 minutes to take out and care for my dog, and get ready for work, then have to come home and still be expected to do my evening chores i don't mind doing all of that but he whines and complains that nothing is done while not doing anything himself. 

But during the fight I had called him a ""Lazy piece of shit father who does nothing"" and that is what triggered him to be beyond pissed and I had been holding my dog who in the first place does not like me at all while having the argument but my father had proceeded to walk and stand no more than 3 inches from me and just said ""Hit me"" he has tried that in the past so he could hit me while it being 'self defense' (He also had a camera that would show i hit him first) but the last time he did that i hit him and my mom stopped him from hitting me (At the time 13) and he told me ""Next time i will leave you on the ground in a pool of your own blood. after that i shoved him and told him to ""Step back before i do hit you"" and I went to my room and slammed the door and part of the wood trim came off (Just needed to be put back and nailed back in) and my mom came in and started to defend him i had used my body to push her out of my room and lock the door and then called my aunt to come pick me up, she showed up to my house about 5 minutes later to get me and my mom had tried to stop me and i once again used my body to push her out of the way and once I got outside my aunt was talking to my dad and i had gotten into her car and then waited for my aunt to follow but she stayed to try and get the story of what happened, no less than 3 minutes after getting in my aunts car 1 after another 4 cop cars pull up (no siren, no lights) and i told the officer what happened and included the part of his threat when we last had a fight. 

I had spent the last 3 1/2 weeks at my aunts house with my cousins occasionally smoking weed while there and 2 days ago her neighbor had texted her about a ""Weed smell"" and my cousin (Her daughter 23) asked me if i could stop and i said yes because i didn't want to cause troubles for my aunt and her family so i said i would stop and tonight (About 4 hours ago) had gave me an ultimatum of i either go home or she will call the police but not to just make me go but search the house (That would also get my aunt in trouble) even though she didn't do anything nor do anything illegal and so after about and hour of me standing in my aunts kitchen and staring at the wall (I don't talk to my parents after the fight) while my father sat there saying nothing (My mom is currently trying to get a divorce) while my mom sat there and threw insults at me and blamed me for things out of my control.

But to the point my mental health has gone down and down due to this and i have had about 4 active suicidal thoughts a day each thought is there for about 1/2 hour and has been in a downward spiral and my mom only throws some pills (Anti depressants) and basically tell me to deal with it. and i can't be here it gives me flash back (Most likely from C-PTSD) and if in honest the only thing i care about here is my dog (Different from the one earlier stated) and i'm starting to things that the only way for me to be happy is if im dead and all i want is for me to be happy but i have to live with the person who most likely is the cause of possible C-PTSD and my mom defends him all that i'm told is that im a disappointment why am i not better how i can't do anything right.

,SuicideWatch,"This is what Dubai is for me...

Last year I decided to left France and start a new life in Dubai. After 22 years of careers through military, firefighter, paramedic, policeman, teacher, consultant... I decided to left this crazy, country of racists, homophobic, close-minded and aggressive to restart a new life.
In fact, I've been harassed by the director of the fire department who never accepted that I married a transgender from Philippines. I'm divorced now by the way.
After I sold my house and resigned my career I traveled 13 countries in Europe, South America and Middle East. Until I found Dubai. During this time I use all my money in trading and forex and I was almost millionaire. Homeless but comfortable situation.
Later I.lost everything because of new waves of Covid. Doesn't matter I still have a good health, my arms and I'm a genius (I mean high IQ).
So I decide to restart here. I bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3000$ a month. Time for me to settle down a new life here.
My miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. Everything was fine until may. 
On May 14th I ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. Regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell.
I'm self taught and I worked hard to improve the system. But I found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. Impossible.Too many issues. And it's like a scam. He deliver to the clients  and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore...
I still work to found out a system that I created and able to work in the UAE. I purposed it to my boss. But he doesn't wanna change anything.
During this time I notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. Finally on July 14th I decided to stop.
Our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during August from France.
Finally today, he kept my miners (50k usd), he never paid my salary and I had to explain my daughters that I can't see them this summer.
I lost everything. I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my food, I can't pay my insurance and now I'm sick...
I'm so stupid to believe people. I've been to police but as he is local and I have no official contract there's nothing they can do.
I've been to his competitor company to tell them that I can do this system for them. They was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. But later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. The boss try to know my system I created to keep it for him and later get rid of me.
Today, I'm in a very bad situation, I keep fighting, I guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. I'm starving and I have fever now...
After one year... I really still.love Dubai. But as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode...

,SuicideWatch,"Not too long ago, I had a date for myself. August 13. That was the day I would end my own life using researched methods to make sure my death was as painless and quick as possible. It was the day that I would have died alone in my house before my family returned from vacation with no one else but my dog obliviously resting by my cadaver.

A part of me still wanted to live. It's the part of me that wrote that post in this subreddit, and it's the part of me that convinced me to reach out to a friend to liberate my feelings for once. I cried. I said the reasons I had come up with to live just weren't enough for me anymore. Not hobbies. Not family. Not natural beauty. It just felt like everything was a lie or an illusion.

During that call, I was able to come up with a reason to stay alive. I could not deny the fact that suicide is a horrible thing. Yes, in some circumstances it's necessary, but in most it's not. My family had already suffered a suicide. It was my aunt's husband. He hung himself in a drunken stupor. Maybe the alcohol made his weak spot show and whatever haunted him took advantage. I don't know. I never knew him. He died well before I was born. Regardless, I knew that if I committed suicide, the trauma would reopen several wounds in my family. My aunt and her side of the family would grieve again but more viscerally this time. My mom suffers from clinical depression like me, so my suicide would destroy her. Other relatives may lash out at my parents and point fingers to cope with the pain, causing irreparable rifts to balkanize my entire family. 

I don't want to bring anymore pain into this world. There's more than enough.  I think my medication was able to help me have some sense of reason during this time. I suffer from seasonal depression ironically during the summer. The past summer was one of my worst depressive episodes ever. I did consider suicide, but I didn't even have the energy to actualize it, as grim as it may sound I was fortunate for that. 

Still, I was bitter at the world. I was bitter that people I'd try to be friends with would reveal something bad about themselves that would make me want to distance myself from them. I was bitter that I'd be singled out for ridicule, condescension, bullying, and other mistreatment behind the scenes, so that everyone else got to enjoy the beautiful persona of someone who had hurt me. I was bitter that my efforts to overcome my depression seemed to always result in going back to square one after a very short period of time. 

After talking with my friend, I was at least able to let that bitterness give me some more reasons why I shouldn't end my own life.

1. This world is full of *pendejadas* (Bullshit. I prefer the word in Spanish because it's more colorful to me), but I'm not gonna let it be my reason to end my life. Why? I don't think this world is worth ending my life over because it's a crock of horseshit, *and I'm not going to let horseshit get me to do something I shouldn't do.*
2. I have come to accept that since the world is full of *pendejadas*, I might as well let it become my norm. If I'm numb to it, it can't hurt me or haunt me. Emotional pain would become a slap on the wrist. I can manage my expectations. I can lower my standards to a reasonable extent. It'll help me appreciate the little good things that come by.
3. In a world full of *pendejadas*, there are also people full of *pendejadas*. So I shouldn't take anything personally. Not my boss, not my roommates, not my bullies, not my family, not my fake friends, no one. If I'm going to give a shit, no one is going to get it but me. I'm here to care about my own shit, my own well-being. What anyone else does means nothing. I'm just trying to be comfortable.
4. A promise to myself: The more this world tries to be cruel to me, the more I will take care of myself. It's the best revenge after all: good health. If I can't have happiness easily, I could at least make sure I eat enough food, drink enough water, maintain good hygiene, clean my room, distract myself with media, pursue hobbies, etc. *This world is apathetic to me, so I shall be apathetic about its apathy.*
5. It's very easy for me to be obsessed with something outside of myself as a distraction. Some stupid event. Some mundane person. Some worthless thing. Some useless activity. When really, I should just be obsessed with myself. What do I want to do with my life? What do I want to do for fun? What do I want to have for lunch? It's about *my* decisions. My self-care.
6. In order to fulfill this ultimate self-care, I must reduce the *pendejadas* in my life. I plan on doing so in the following ways:
   1. Keeping my social circle small and being extremely picky about who I let in and who I keep around. I will label people. I'm not going to form attachments easily. I will expect the worst out of any person.
   2. I think most humans aren't worth a relationship of any kind. So I'm not going to concern myself with finding a romantic partner (I'm aromantic any way), having children, or making new friends. I'm not closing myself off, I'm just not on the look out anymore. Forming new relationships will no longer be something I try to do (unless it's for my survival, like for work).
   3. I accept that things will never be the way I want them to be. 90% of the sex I have with men is mediocre. Many friendships I have fail because I end up overlooking how they mistreat me or they just end up mistreating me inevitably. This world will never accept me or accommodate for who I am based on my salient identities such as race, gender, and ability, at least not in my lifetime. 

I'm tired of my dramatic suffering. I'm tired of shitty humans. I'm tired of the world employing its innovative torture methods on me. I didn't ask to be here, I didn't agree to anything, and I just want to go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;li&gt;In a world full of &lt;em&gt;pendejadas&lt;/em&gt;, there are also people full of &lt;em&gt;pendejadas&lt;/em&gt;. So I shouldn&amp;#39;t take anything personally. Not my boss, not my roommates, not my bullies, not my family, not my fake friends, no one. If I&amp;#39;m going to give a shit, no one is going to get it but me. I&amp;#39;m here to care about my own shit, my own well-being. What anyone else does means nothing. I&amp;#39;m just trying to be comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A promise to myself: The more this world tries to be cruel to me, the more I will take care of myself. It&amp;#39;s the best revenge after all: good health. If I can&amp;#39;t have happiness easily, I could at least make sure I eat enough food, drink enough water, maintain good hygiene, clean my room, distract myself with media, pursue hobbies, etc. &lt;em&gt;This world is apathetic to me, so I shall be apathetic about its apathy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s very easy for me to be obsessed with something outside of myself as a distraction. Some stupid event. Some mundane person. Some worthless thing. Some useless activity. When really, I should just be obsessed with myself. What do I want to do with my life? What do I want to do for fun? What do I want to have for lunch? It&amp;#39;s about &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; decisions. My self-care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to fulfill this ultimate self-care, I must reduce the &lt;em&gt;pendejadas&lt;/em&gt; in my life. I plan on doing so in the following ways:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping my social circle small and being extremely picky about who I let in and who I keep around. I will label people. I&amp;#39;m not going to form attachments easily. I will expect the worst out of any person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think most humans aren&amp;#39;t worth a relationship of any kind. So I&amp;#39;m not going to concern myself with finding a romantic partner (I&amp;#39;m aromantic any way), having children, or making new friends. I&amp;#39;m not closing myself off, I&amp;#39;m just not on the look out anymore. Forming new relationships will no longer be something I try to do (unless it&amp;#39;s for my survival, like for work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept that things will never be the way I want them to be. 90% of the sex I have with men is mediocre. Many friendships I have fail because I end up overlooking how they mistreat me or they just end up mistreating me inevitably. This world will never accept me or accommodate for who I am based on my salient identities such as race, gender, and ability, at least not in my lifetime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of my dramatic suffering. I&amp;#39;m tired of shitty humans. I&amp;#39;m tired of the world employing its innovative torture methods on me. I didn&amp;#39;t ask to be here, I didn&amp;#39;t agree to anything, and I just want to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: I used to want to kill myself. I changed my mind after talking to a friend because it made me realize that this world is bullshit, most people are bullshit, most things are bullshit. And I&amp;#39;m not letting bullshit influence my actions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Throw away account because I have family on Reddit. Basically I’m miserable. A part of me feels guilty for even considering writing something like this. For some context, I’m an 18 year old female, people would say I have an amazing life. I’ve got a big family and parents that love me so much, my upbringing was great, I’m a spoilt child, have the best support system from my family too. However I have an ED and suffer everyday of my life with chronic nausea, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD years ago and have tried both therapy and medication along with self soothing techniques. Nothing has worked. I have had hundreds of tests done, bloods, stools, urine, fitness, gyno, I’ve seen both a therapist and a nutritionist and I’ve even done hypnotherapy. 

Long story short, i get nausea every single day, it starts the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep (if I can even sleep that night). Accompanying this nausea i have extreme stomach twitching, it’s not painful but it’s extremely uncomfortable, It makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, so bad I wish to rip my stomach out. No body knows what’s causing these symptoms and they have just been pinned to anxiety which is fair enough if only I could cure my anxiety. Every day of my life I’m miserable, I lost interest in all that I used to love like my cat, reading and gaming, I don’t go out because I’m just constantly uncomfortable and nauseated, I’m barely strong enough now to even walk anyways, I have no friends anymore, all I can do is sit about and stare into space. I’m so numb to everything that I can’t even cry anymore, in fact I feel like I can’t show any emotion anymore. I don’t laugh, I don’t cry, I don’t show anger or sympathy, I can’t even force a smile. 

I’ve never had an appetite and I don’t eat a lot of food because it makes me easily uncomfortable or irritates my body, this lead to a ED diagnosis at a younger age. I’m severely underweight and lacking basic minerals to stay healthy, I survive on protein shakes and biscuits for the most part. I had seen an ED therapist for a while but nothing changed. 

At this point I don’t know what to do anymore, my parents are clearly exhausted and so am I, I don’t find the point in living anymore and literally the only think that is stopping me from suicide at this point is knowing I’d bring my parents and little siblings so much pain, even tho part of me feels like being gone would relieve the load from my parents shoulders. I see my siblings living their lives every day so carefree and happily, never having to worry about throwing up or giving out and it makes me that little bit more miserable. I know it’s not their fault and I don’t wish for them to be miserable like me at all btw, I suppose I’m just jealous of them. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this or why I wrote it but I just wanted to get it off my chest because I can’t share it with anymore else. I don’t want to tell my parents I’m suicidal, even though I’m pretty sure they’re already aware. I’m at a loss because what is there to do at this point, I’ve tried everything, I’ve reached out for help, I’ve been on meds, I even started self harming this last year just to convince myself I can still feel something.

,SuicideWatch,"This is what Dubai is for me...

Last year I decided to left France and start a new life in Dubai. After 22 years of careers through military, firefighter, paramedic, policeman, teacher, consultant... I decided to left this crazy, country of racists, homophobic, close-minded and aggressive to restart a new life.
In fact, I've been harassed by the director of the fire department who never accepted that I married a transgender from Philippines. I'm divorced now by the way.
After I sold my house and resigned my career I traveled 13 countries in Europe, South America and Middle East. Until I found Dubai. During this time I use all my money in trading and forex and I was almost millionaire. Homeless but comfortable situation.
Later I.lost everything because of new waves of Covid. Doesn't matter I still have a good health, my arms and I'm a genius (I mean high IQ).
So I decide to restart here. I bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3000$ a month. Time for me to settle down a new life here.
My miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. Everything was fine until may. 
On May 14th I ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. Regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell.
I'm self taught and I worked hard to improve the system. But I found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. Impossible.Too many issues. And it's like a scam. He deliver to the clients  and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore...
I still work to found out a system that I created and able to work in the UAE. I purposed it to my boss. But he doesn't wanna change anything.
During this time I notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. Finally on July 14th I decided to stop.
Our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during August from France.
Finally today, he kept my miners (50k usd), he never paid my salary and I had to explain my daughters that I can't see them this summer.
I lost everything. I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my food, I can't pay my insurance and now I'm sick...
I'm so stupid to believe people. I've been to police but as he is local and I have no official contract there's nothing they can do.
I've been to his competitor company to tell them that I can do this system for them. They was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. But later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. The boss try to know my system I created to keep it for him and later get rid of me.
Today, I'm in a very bad situation, I keep fighting, I guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. I'm starving and I have fever now...
After one year... I really still.love Dubai. But as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode...

,SuicideWatch,"So back story grew up oldest of three brothers with and drunk abusive father that abused us until I was least 15 idk my parents split up we also constantly moved.
My mother is bi polar and schizophrenic. We had to go through livin with a parent that goes through that and get blamed every time she went to hospital. When they split I went with her alone so someone would take care of her. She still struggles with it to this day.  Around 20 to 21 I got with a girl that was pregnant by another man she was a family friend so we ended up falling in love when I went over there to protect and watch over. We broke up right before the child was born but got right back together and we’re on and off for 8 years the whole time her telling the kid I’m his real father. Even tho her father constantly told people at his parities and when trick or treatin I’m not really us dad. Long story short the youngest brother kills himself in 2019. Me and the girlfriend last a year after and than break up but she won’t let me talk or see the kid anymore. My middle age brother goes through a divorce at same time and loses some rights to his daughter but can still see some and least talk to her. We both have now been on heroin for last two years. I have finally been trying to convince him for us to both quit for good for his daughter and grandma. Also cause feel like we lost youngest brother to coke. He started getting really depressed off it and night killer himself he was on it. So I feel it even more wrong for me and other brother to do drugs cause they took out youngest from us. The biggest problem we live with grandma that is like our mom and she enables us tremendously. Giving us money every day and letting us use the cars. Even when we have told her not to trust us etc.

Hopefully this time she sticks by not enabling idk tho cause she said she give no one anything anymore but she still gave me money. Fortunately I actually want us to quit especially my brother cause he has the most to lose. Everytime we try to he breaks I even went to the hospital and put myself on a l2k just to quit but came back to him and his friend that lives with us using. So I started again. Anyway sorry for long sob story just hope people can wish us luck on getting clean because I’m beyond codependent on my brother I can’t lose another and be left alone. I hate us hurting our grandma tho cause she done nothing but be there for us our whole life. That’s why I feel like I’m give up on life if we don’t make it this time.

,SuicideWatch,"You know what I mean? Hi, sorry, just another scream in the void because where else should screams go? I don't know, this is the weirdest suicidal ideation I've ever had in my life. I'll give you some context, I suppose.


I've got my fair share of trauma. I've collected all the abuse types, so to speak. Diagnosed with BPD when I was 19, never had the ability to hold on to a job or a relationship. Whenever I found someone to give me affection my entire world would revolve around them; I'd obsess over them and if I felt like they didn't love me I would feel every nerve in my body set ablaze. It was a pain that was blinding and suffocating and it felt like the only way to end it was to extinguish my very existence. I've had kidney stones that felt like ecstasy compared to that raw, burning pain of feeling unloved. Every time I've ever wanted to die, it was a very, very active thought that I MUST die, immediately. But...


I got better for a while. I actually joked that I was the first person to be cured of BPD. I had untreated Grave's disease, my thyroid was frying my brain with a daily overdose of thyroid hormones. I never got treatment because every time a doctor tried to treat me they would sternly tell me, ""if you continue to leave this untreated, you will die."" Man, I wanted to die. I hated myself. I hated my life. I always thought, ""good, if it kills me that's one less thing on my to do list!"" So I let my brain fry like that for years. I finally accepted treatment one day because the person I was in a relationship with at the time begged me, and it was the first time I actually felt that I had a person who loved me as much as I loved them (very rare for a BPD, lemme tell ya). So I did it. I got it fixed. And holy shit. Holy shit. Bliss. 


It was a slow change. Not immediate. As my physical symptoms went away and my body was healing, my headspace started to shift too. At the age of 25 I was finally born. For the first time in my life I was able to keep a job. I was fucking awesome at my job, too. I started feeling capable. I started feeling confident. I stopped hating myself. I started... liking myself. I started loving myself. I would think of all my past suicide attempts and have these horrible panic attacks thinking that I almost missed out on all of this joy. I almost prevented myself from experiencing this wonderful life. It hurt my heart to think of my past self suffering. She deserved better. But I was happy to finally be able to give myself better. I sent myself telepathic love letters to the past; I'd think as hard as I could to please hold on because holding on will get us to here, and I love you so much, past me, so please keep being strong. I still had rough days but they were just days. I was happy. 


Then the world ended. Thanks 2020. I tried staying strong for so long. I lost my job, but I tried to be optimistic about it because I'd been feeling like I wanted something better. I lost some friends. I lost my partner. I got my first apartment and was (and still am) single. I had always been in relationships since I started dating; I was codependent as hell and I couldn't take being alone. But I learned to love being single. It's a lot easier to be alone when you don't despise yourself. I found a lovely group of friends, I talked to them every day. I had a lot of money saved up to pay my rent without working for a while. I was down. But it was just a low point. It was nothing like that searing, burning pain I used to feel. Not even comparable.


But it keeps... getting lower. I still don't have an income and it like I can't figure out how to get myself to work now. I have started attaching my worth to my crush again. My bank account is overdrafted the entirety of my rent payment this month. I'm out of money. I keep getting into these moods where I feel like my sweet friends don't care about me. They hurt my feelings sometimes and I know I feel too much. I know I'm too sensitive. But they hurt me and then act like it's my fault I'm hurt and I feel like the best thing I can do is just... Disappear. 


And that's what I want. I want to disappear. I want to get in my car. And drive. And I want to feel the tires gently start to lift off the road, getting higher and higher, miles and miles above the earth, until finally I plummet into a black hole. It doesn't hurt like acid, it hurts like Novocaine. There's no feeling at all but you know the drill is going too deep. And I just want it to stop.


I want to stop worrying about money. I want to stop worrying about being too sensitive. I want to be held. I want to feel loved. I want to vanish. I want to be seen. I want to be heard. I want to be cherished. I want to be enough. I want someone to care. I want the Novocaine to wear off. I want to feel. 


Sometimes I imagine how it would feel to drive very fast, and stop even faster, crashing my car into a tree. And when I imagine it, it feels like nothing at all. I know, I KNOW it would hurt so bad if I really did it. It would hurt a lot and I may feel pain forever. But I would feel. God, I would feel. 


Anyways I'm not really sure what to do about all that. I won't hurt myself because I can't. I care about myself too much. I know I don't want to be dead, I just don't want the life I currently have. But I feel like I will never have the one I want. It feels so out of reach. And I feel like my brokenness is so trivial compared to where I was years ago. Past me felt real pain. Past me would laugh if she heard someone like me talk about being suicidal because she'd see right through it. She'd say, ""you're not really even suicidal. You don't even know pain.

Hi, sorry, just another scream in the void because where else should screams go? I don&amp;#39;t know, this is the weirdest suicidal ideation I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my life. I&amp;#39;ll give you some context, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got my fair share of trauma. I&amp;#39;ve collected all the abuse types, so to speak. Diagnosed with BPD when I was 19, never had the ability to hold on to a job or a relationship. Whenever I found someone to give me affection my entire world would revolve around them; I&amp;#39;d obsess over them and if I felt like they didn&amp;#39;t love me I would feel every nerve in my body set ablaze. It was a pain that was blinding and suffocating and it felt like the only way to end it was to extinguish my very existence. I&amp;#39;ve had kidney stones that felt like ecstasy compared to that raw, burning pain of feeling unloved. Every time I&amp;#39;ve ever wanted to die, it was a very, very active thought that I MUST die, immediately. But...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got better for a while. I actually joked that I was the first person to be cured of BPD. I had untreated Grave&amp;#39;s disease, my thyroid was frying my brain with a daily overdose of thyroid hormones. I never got treatment because every time a doctor tried to treat me they would sternly tell me, &amp;quot;if you continue to leave this untreated, you will die.&amp;quot; Man, I wanted to die. I hated myself. I hated my life. I always thought, &amp;quot;good, if it kills me that&amp;#39;s one less thing on my to do list!&amp;quot; So I let my brain fry like that for years. I finally accepted treatment one day because the person I was in a relationship with at the time begged me, and it was the first time I actually felt that I had a person who loved me as much as I loved them (very rare for a BPD, lemme tell ya). So I did it. I got it fixed. And holy shit. Holy shit. Bliss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a slow change. Not immediate. As my physical symptoms went away and my body was healing, my headspace started to shift too. At the age of 25 I was finally born. For the first time in my life I was able to keep a job. I was fucking awesome at my job, too. I started feeling capable. I started feeling confident. I stopped hating myself. I started... liking myself. I started loving myself. I would think of all my past suicide attempts and have these horrible panic attacks thinking that I almost missed out on all of this joy. I almost prevented myself from experiencing this wonderful life. It hurt my heart to think of my past self suffering. She deserved better. But I was happy to finally be able to give myself better. I sent myself telepathic love letters to the past; I&amp;#39;d think as hard as I could to please hold on because holding on will get us to here, and I love you so much, past me, so please keep being strong. I still had rough days but they were just days. I was happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the world ended. Thanks 2020. I tried staying strong for so long. I lost my job, but I tried to be optimistic about it because I&amp;#39;d been feeling like I wanted something better. I lost some friends. I lost my partner. I got my first apartment and was (and still am) single. I had always been in relationships since I started dating; I was codependent as hell and I couldn&amp;#39;t take being alone. But I learned to love being single. It&amp;#39;s a lot easier to be alone when you don&amp;#39;t despise yourself. I found a lovely group of friends, I talked to them every day. I had a lot of money saved up to pay my rent without working for a while. I was down. But it was just a low point. It was nothing like that searing, burning pain I used to feel. Not even comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it keeps... getting lower. I still don&amp;#39;t have an income and it like I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to get myself to work now. I have started attaching my worth to my crush again. My bank account is overdrafted the entirety of my rent payment this month. I&amp;#39;m out of money. I keep getting into these moods where I feel like my sweet friends don&amp;#39;t care about me. They hurt my feelings sometimes and I know I feel too much. I know I&amp;#39;m too sensitive. But they hurt me and then act like it&amp;#39;s my fault I&amp;#39;m hurt and I feel like the best thing I can do is just... Disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s what I want. I want to disappear. I want to get in my car. And drive. And I want to feel the tires gently start to lift off the road, getting higher and higher, miles and miles above the earth, until finally I plummet into a black hole. It doesn&amp;#39;t hurt like acid, it hurts like Novocaine. There&amp;#39;s no feeling at all but you know the drill is going too deep. And I just want it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to stop worrying about money. I want to stop worrying about being too sensitive. I want to be held. I want to feel loved. I want to vanish. I want to be seen. I want to be heard. I want to be cherished. I want to be enough. I want someone to care. I want the Novocaine to wear off. I want to feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I imagine how it would feel to drive very fast, and stop even faster, crashing my car into a tree. And when I imagine it, it feels like nothing at all. I know, I KNOW it would hurt so bad if I really did it. It would hurt a lot and I may feel pain forever. But I would feel. God, I would feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I&amp;#39;m not really sure what to do about all that. I won&amp;#39;t hurt myself because I can&amp;#39;t. I care about myself too much. I know I don&amp;#39;t want to be dead, I just don&amp;#39;t want the life I currently have. But I feel like I will never have the one I want. It feels so out of reach. And I feel like my brokenness is so trivial compared to where I was years ago. Past me felt real pain. Past me would laugh if she heard someone like me talk about being suicidal because she&amp;#39;d see right through it. She&amp;#39;d say, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re not really even suicidal. You don&amp;#39;t even know pain. You&amp;#39;re choosing to be weak. You&amp;#39;re choosing this.&amp;quot; And she&amp;#39;d be right. I am. But I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop. I really don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just when everything became better, I was raped.
Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everything I&amp;#39;ve worked through from my childhood came back with it.
The nightmares, the anxiety attacks, not being able to eat or shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My doctor can&amp;#39;t do anything anymore, and my psychologist is on holiday for two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21 years old, and I have been living with the wish to just end it al since I was 7.
I know I have tried everything there is.
I don&amp;#39;t want to go through all the therapy I had, again. I promised myself that if I tried everything and it didn&amp;#39;t work, I could let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I will miss the opportunity to try new things I might enjoy, beautiful moments with friends or family. I know what I will leave behind, but it isn&amp;#39;t enough to stay anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found peace in my choice.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've got no right for sympathy or space to be heard. I'm sorry for posting it. Could have written just for myself, but I feel that the symbolic value of telling about it to others can make me feel being heard. I'll soon delete it. 

It's all my fault. My loneliness, self-hstred, increasing anxiety and slow abandonment of any human lifestyle. I wasn't working or solving problems only in transport between jobs and now, when came home. I'm tired but I'm not. 

I envy people that were told they are loved. I envy kind and generous people. I envy confident ones. I envy people with strong resilience. I can envy people that don't try to run away from their families. I envy attention. 

The older I get the less I believe myself when I dream I can run away and pretend to be normal. That I can become better, that i can have moments of happiness.

I caught myself thinking that there's nothing left in my life that makes it worth it. Then I rembered how happy I feel when I put my alarm ten minutes later early cool morning and stay under warm blanket. That's the only thing that gives me strength.

I'll never make anyone happy. I can't afford to have kids. I don't love anything and anyone, including myself. I no longer believe that I can get love by  being polite, studying gard, doing my low-wage part-time jobs responsibly or making good films. 
You'll never make good films because you've started doing them to get love you want. That's why you had no progress throughout film school. You literally liked only one film of yours  because you liked the person you worked on it with. You're literally the worst. Asshole. 

I have a dream. I don't want to kill myself - just like so many people that fight these urges I just want it all to end. I want to lose my memory: my visual, muscle and reflex memory. It's ok, I don't have that many skills. I want to forget parents, him and her, I want to forget shame and a habit to beat myself up. It's all my fault. It's a very adult self-hatred, I'm proud of maturing.  

I was trying to control myself and not let bad thoughts out. I'm keeping silent about suicide thoughts, self-hstred and real unwillingness to shoot our next film. I improved, I'm trying to keep myself together. I have no energy to improved but I try really hard to keep yogether. And still whenever I slip I'm the biggest asshole in the world. ""How could you tell me you were fighting suicide thoughts. Like why would you put it on me? I'm not an audience for that."" Thanks. Now I feel even more guilty. 

I'm so tired. I want it all to end. I want to stop fighting desire to smash my head against the wall and punch myseld in the stomach with all my force. I want to stop fighting urge to scream to you how angry I am, how lonely it has been for me. 

I've cried so much tonight. But I'm doing a good thing, I'm trying to put it all out, I'm trying to understand what's going on. I haven't even reached out to anyone, that's veryvresponsible. There is a chance for me. If I have enough energy I can invest concentration and energy into thinking better, into making my thoughts go in a right direction. I will be able to overcome my ego and fear. I will be able to concentrate on perfecting my storytelling skills. I will not kill myself. I will not be a miserable lonely loser. It will take time, but I'll get there. I'll be calm, I'll be likeable, I'll have something to tell.sbout myself at the parties. 

I've got a suspicion what a trigger might have been. Fuck you, stupid man. You're the worst, you've got no taste, you handle bad moods even worse than I do and you're dumb as a newborn pigeon. Never want to hear about you again. There's a reason I cut people I loved from my life and convince myself they never really existed. 

I want a healthy clear brain. I want a strong ego that doesn't need anyone else. I want a stone heart. I want resilience of a grass lane. 

It got better now, which is good. I've stopped screaming and sobbing, I won't need to occupy suicide prevention line, I got it myself. I'm a writer. I should learn how to construct that lie of a healthy reality. I want to forget and stop aching. If I tell myself more often I might forget what the truth is.

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t know if i truly wanna kill my self or not but god im reaching my breaking point. Im tired of always being scared; I have OCD and constantly worry about sickness, or hurting other, etc etc. Just this week I was debating whether or not give up oil painting cause I had read about the toxicity of oil paints, i spiraled and threw out all my solvents, and paints that were not of natural oil. You would think that would calm me down but no, I’m still freaking out if smelling oil paint or any kind of paint will give me a chronic disease. I’m so tired of being afraid of everything, I’m tired of being depressed. Or not being able to do dumb shit without being afraid of fucking getting cancer. I can’t even enjoy something that’s suppose to be relaxing.

I went through a lot as a kid, my parents weren’t the best. At least I don’t think so I don’t know what I experienced was love, I was pampered, they bought me anything and everything. I was spoiled. But behind close doors I was yelled at, pinched, hit with belts, manipulated, threatened, the list goes on. I was mostly my mother while my father was absent due to work; he doesn’t even remember my birthday. I remember the moment where my mother truly hurt me; as Hispanics giving the “belt” was a typical punishment. Though when I was young I can’t remember what I did, I could’ve been in elementary. My mother had gotten her hands on a whip from my older sisters previous Halloween costume, she folded it and whipped me on my fore arm leaving a lash mark. I remember crying, apologizing to her. She cries as well but never apologized. I was a kid. 

I think most of my issues started from then, I developed OCD. Constantly worrying about anything and everything, I was was gonna grow up to be a murder, if I was gonna die tomorrow if I didn’t wash my hands, etc. My childhood instead of being filled with happiness and rainbows was filled with fear and loneliness. I would come home to a house filled with fighting, my father drank, cheated, my mother was always in the kitchen and my sister ,bless her, tried her best to be a mother figure. But despite that I grew up thinking that the yelling and the pain was love. That I should be grateful, when other kids had nothing. And I had a computer, iPad, etc. To this day I’m scared to admit that my parents hurt me.

Self harm, I didn’t know what that word meant till middle school. I use to wonder why anyone would ever mutilate themselves, but slowly I started to find out why. I started to use rubber bands to slap my wrists, punch walls to bruise my knuckles, I just wanted to find any way to feel something.  Not long after I found a razor and started; after spending hours in the bathroom, I came out happy. As if I let out all that tightness; so I kept doing it. It made me forget. My wrists, stomach, forearms ,thighs covered; most of the cuts were shallow and didn’t leave scaring.

It’s wasn’t long till my mother found out, she cried. Though I was given no comfort, on the country she just called my therapist to handle it. As my father was in the living room without a care in the world watching his soccer game, I was taken to the hospital, assisted, well I wasn’t my distressed mother was. The doctors never took my word, and it was clear from the moment I got there. So I started to lie, they had already deemed my cuts to be shallow and not enough to be hospitalized and since I basically told them I was fine they just referred me to a psychiatrist and sent me on my way. Did the psychiatrist help? No whatever I said in trust went through my mom, and she often twisted my words or just basically said things I did not say. Since I couldn’t escape the psychiatrist, therapy or medication I turned to cutting. I remember being so desperate to cut that I’d rip eyebrow cutters or shaving razors to just get my hands on one. And I did, this time what was shallow cuts became gashes and they scarred. Then I started to attempt my life, five separate times I attempted and no one knows. It was in middle school as well as my freshmen year of high school. I just remember crying and brushing my knuckles frustrated that I was such a pussy for not going through with it, I was in pain why couldn’t I just make it stop.

That leads to now I’m going to college in the fall, an art school, majoring in illustration. Stoped my medication, the pills never worked so why bother. I also didn’t stop cutting, no one knows but what I found I became more sensitive. Little things , little fears would be resolved in hurting myself. Like my intrusive fears of oil painting, I love oil painting I want to keep doing it but I’m afraid of cancer, and other chronic sickness so what do I do. I cut. God I’m pathetic why am I writing a Reddit post of my life, maybe because I just want someone to care to not look at me as if I’m crazy to not insult me or manipulate me like I was all my life. To not think my OCD/ intrusive fears are stupid, I want to be treated like a person I want to live a normal life but I can’t do that. I can’t even make decisions for myself without being scared, I’m a grown ass person and I’m crying about the smallest things.

,SuicideWatch,"Over 9 years. I have wanted to end it all for almost a decade. I can't do this anymore. I've tried meds, I've done therapy, I've tried yoga, outdoors time, I even took a fucking six month hiatus off working(I was threatened with the psychward) and now all my fucking savings are gone. I tried to go back to work last month and almost got committed. 

It just never got better. Never not once. intrusive thoughts are always there. Awful horrible thoughts about hurting others. Incest, murder, violence. They won't leave. I want to hurt myself every fucking day. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Then there's they physical pain. Chronic aches and headaches and hives. The fact that I just got diagnosed with a mental disability, but I'm not ""disabled enough"" for help.

I acknowledge I'm blessed enough to have a roof over my head. I'm blessed enough to have food and clean water. But man. If I die I'd save my folks so much money. My family wouldnt have to live with their knives  and meds (even just ibuprofen) locked up at all times. They wouldn't have to monitor the bathroom after I eat to see if I purged. They wouldn't have to check if  I swallowed my pills. They would have to keep an eye on the gun safe to make sure i didnt try and break in.they don't have to do full body checks to make sure I didn't hurt myself. No more threatening to shove me in the hospital. More hospital bills. They wouldn't have to worry about me ever again. They have other kids to worry about. I shouldn't be doing this to them.

 Idk what to do. I want to end it but because of my break down I don't have access to anything. My folks even check to make sure i swallowed the damn pills so i cant save them up.  Idk if this makes sense. I just want peace. I want it all to end. I came so close and blew it. I got caught. And now I'm trapped in this eternal hell.

I&amp;#39;ve tried meds, I&amp;#39;ve done therapy, I&amp;#39;ve tried yoga, outdoors time, I even took a fucking six month hiatus off working(I was threatened with the psychward) and now all my fucking savings are gone. I tried to go back to work last month and almost got committed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just never got better. Never not once. intrusive thoughts are always there. Awful horrible thoughts about hurting others. Incest, murder, violence. They won&amp;#39;t leave. I want to hurt myself every fucking day. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Then there&amp;#39;s they physical pain. Chronic aches and headaches and hives. The fact that I just got diagnosed with a mental disability, but I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;disabled enough&amp;quot; for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge I&amp;#39;m blessed enough to have a roof over my head. I&amp;#39;m blessed enough to have food and clean water. But man. If I die I&amp;#39;d save my folks so much money. My family wouldnt have to live with their knives  and meds (even just ibuprofen) locked up at all times. They wouldn&amp;#39;t have to monitor the bathroom after I eat to see if I purged. They wouldn&amp;#39;t have to check if  I swallowed my pills. They would have to keep an eye on the gun safe to make sure i didnt try and break in.they don&amp;#39;t have to do full body checks to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t hurt myself. No more threatening to shove me in the hospital. More hospital bills. They wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about me ever again. They have other kids to worry about. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk what to do. I want to end it but because of my break down I don&amp;#39;t have access to anything. My folks even check to make sure i swallowed the damn pills so i cant save them up.  Idk if this makes sense. I just want peace. I want it all to end. I came so close and blew it. I got caught. And now I&amp;#39;m trapped in this eternal hell. Maybe I could scrounge enough up for a gun, but my folks are managing my payments too. Idk I hate this. It&amp;#39;s been so long.&lt;/p&gt;

I live in an apartment that was given to me by my grandma since my step dad died and my mom got strung out. She sells drugs now and is even less of a mother than she already was. I guess I can say I've been through a lot. Neglect, abuse, sexual assault..but honestly none of that really matters. It's the aftermath of everything that fucks me up. I have horrible mood swings. Every single day, I go through periods of extreme anger and sadness. When I'm angry, I like to ruin things for myself. When I'm sad, all I can think about is killing myself and how unlovable I am. That gut wrenching feeling occurs every single day, but even when I'm okay. I feel so empty, nothing and no one can fill the void. I've made so many people hate me. I don't have anyone close in my family. My grandma pushed me into an eating disorder, and my brother sexually assaulted me. I have a best friend that I constantly ruin things with, even though they are my everything. No one can fill the void. No amount of pills, or alcohol, or weed, or whatever substance I choose to abuse this week will ever change the fact that I am so empty and alone. My thoughts won't stop and I don't know how to be okay no matter how hard I try. I don't know how to stop ruining things for myself. I don't know how to love people like normal. I don't even think I'm capable of being love or loving someone. And the people that tell me that the small things matter. Getting out of bed, taking a shower, cleaning, amd taking care of myself in any way. That shit never works for me, and I don't understand why. I can do it, but it doesn't stop the consistent empty void I feel every single day. It doesn't stop the intense mood swing. I don't want to feel this anymore and I can only think of one escape.

I attempted suicide in May. I survived, but everyone made it pretty clear how much they didn't care. I was put on Lexapro, and I guess it kind of stabilized my mood. But I still felt so empty, so I stopped taking them. I went through the withdrawal and nearly lost my mind, but I'm still here. I haven't had therapy or anything since, and my first therapy appointment is on the 11th. But I can't tell anyone anything about the stuff that has happened to me without bringing some serious legal trouble onto my parents. And the things I can talk about seem so miniscule.

,SuicideWatch,"I struggle with life, the concept of living, just the idea of waking up another day when almost every moment of joy is just demolished by weeks of sadness.

**I have always been like this.** I don't get this world , I just don't get the humans I interact with. **Why do I feel this immense sense of alienation like I am from another planet?**

I no longer even have emotions apparently, I can only feel the worry inside my guts, or my heart beating so fast as if it were about to explode. I can't even cry when I am extremely sad or miserable, I can't force myself to let my emotions out, not even by screaming out loud.

**Can you really regain control over your own body after you've been abused?** It really sucks how trauma works, especially when it's recent. You can't just think about something else after the incident. It really sucks when you put a lot of value in your studies and one week before an exam you just get the shit beaten out of you. You try to save the day by burying yourself under your studies, but that's not how trauma works, so instead you just show up to an exam completely absent-minded. You feel like there's some sorta disconnect between your body and consciousness, like ""My legs are moving towards my seat, but my brain is somewhere else.""  type of shit. Your brain wants to confront the incident despite knowing goddamn well that it's not the time for such matters. Now, even your most valuable activity has destroyed your self-esteem, brought to you an immense amount of insecurities, you start to wonder whether you belong in this lecture hall or not.

**No matter how many people tell you how good you are at something you will never believe it when your self-image is just distorted.** Yes, you remember your past, the good, the bad, and the ugly. You remember your achievements, you know some good things you have done, your self-image is not some piece of shit human being, it's just a distorted image, you don't know who you are outside of your studies because you don't belong somewhere. You start to question your own choices, decisions, and preferences. You feel like a phony, not because you suck up to people, because you are probably lying to yourself, ""but how would I know since the only voice I listen to is mine?""

Well since my amazing parents do not let me leave my fucking house and have any sort of life (parents that also hate me and insult me and abuse me 24/7, I literally hear words like ""idiot, retard, go fuck yourself"" like idk, 10 times more often than I hear my own name), what I am doing is rotting at home, attempting suicide, crying, sometimes gaming and masturbating because that's the nicest thing I can do but even this is already boring and tiring, oh and also, I can't even express myself! I cannot dress how I want, I cannot look how I want, I cannot be myself like I want, why? Well you fucking guess why, I hate """"""life"""""""", I can't even call it life because what I'm ""living"" is not life, it's vegetation, I'm literally not fucking better than a plant, I do nothing more than a plant does, I mean I can walk and talk but other than that I'm a fucking plant and I get treated like a fucking plant too, like a disgusting plant made from pure dog shit at that.

You cannot call it a life when you have no social life or romantic life or fucking any adjective you put before life, I do not have it

Other people are enjoying life, having fun, doing all these fun stuff, and I am rotting, and hurting when I see them doing all the things I wish I could do

Someone is dying, I either can't take it anymore and kill myself, or I snap and commit an unspeakable crime, either way its not gonna be my fault if this is what I'm dealing with 

And for any of you that say ""oh when you're an adult you will be ok"": 

No, I will not, you cannot tie a birds wings all his life and then cut him loose and drop him from a roof and go ""fly bitch""

I want to be there for her without her feeling like I’ve invaded her privacy OR without her feeling like her husband betrayed her trust.. she needs all the people she can get in her corner right now.. so..

Fast forward a year and I get a new job that I like, but then my mom gets cancer. I felt like it was my ""duty"" to take care of her since I am living here, but I couldn't balance my job and going to the doctor 5 days a week. So I quit. I spend 3 years taking care of her and she dies anyway, in my arms even. For some reason, my older sister gets 50% of the inheritance, even though it was me who sacrificed my life to take care of mom. My dad gets 40%, and me and my younger sister get 10%.  Now my dad is left alone, so I stay to take care of him. He also doesn't have his drivers license. Sister buys a boat, dad pays off the house. I pay for an equal share of a giant tombstone, which cost about 50% of what I was given.

I finally get back into work, have to explain to employers why I was unemployed for so long in my 20s. The new job I work at is terribly filthy, like dust that smells of gunpowder and sulfur and it doesn't wash out. It's a night shift job. My dad doesn't let me sleep in the morning. I'm extremely unhappy, but I'm making enough to support myself, but Idk how much I can keep this up. The smell, the itching, the lack of sleep. Not worth $1000 a week. Then I have a hernia, my insurance doesn't cover me. I get put on light duty for 1 week. I have a panic attack at work during over time and leave. Get fired. Can't get unemployment. I coast on whatever I had saved up.

I get another job that I really like with people who are cool. But I don't make enough to even cover rent if I were to move out. Covid happens. My dad makes me quit my job, but says he'll support me, because he's afraid I'll catch covid being around people and bring it home with me. He's old and talks about dying all the time. It's not a good time. Then my car breaks in half from rust. So now I only drive the family car, which belongs to my dad who can't even legally drive it.

I ask for nothing, I drive him everywhere, I help with yardwork, I take care of the dog. I also still pay my phone bill, while unemployed, getting no income at all. Draining my savings. But he'll support me, right? Two years into this stupid pandemic. I'm out of money. He starts paying my phone bill but acts like it's such a massive burden and talks to me like I'm a gigantic failure. He says he doesn't need my help. He does. He still doesn't have his license to drive. He now has heart problems, isn't eating, won't listen to me trying to help. He complains about money, makes $3000 a month retired, has my moms inheritance, $25000 in the bank ""for funeral expenses"".. again with the dying talk. 

What am I doing here? what was all that for? I'm wasting my life for people who hate me. I'm a burden, a failure. How am I supposed to be independent ever? Do I wait for dad to die? will he leave me anything? Will I be homeless? Can I find work ever again, at my age with my lack of experience and history of quitting? Man... It feels like the best thing is for me to just not exist anymore. I haven't been suicidal in years, but this is really destroying me. If I cost so much to keep alive maybe I'll just stop eating.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey Redditworld!  


Not doing so well, hence why I am on this sub. Anyway, lets get into it, shall we?

**TL;DR: I'm so irrevocably BORED of all this. Can I please have a different challenge at this point?**

Lately, I haven't been feeling the best, dealing with these niggling little fantasies about turning myself into something akin to roadkill lately. A part of the first-degree murder I'd like to commit upon myself is to find a way to make my body disappear. Or at least be hard enough to find so as to allow anyone who will miss me to find closure and/or headcanon that I *didn't* gank myself. But that's neither here nor there...

The reason for this post is that I've come to terms with the fact that I'll be making my exit soon. I was hoping to wait until 40 (I'm 33 now), but now I don't know... I've stopped taking my meds, I probably going to stop going to my therapy appointments--I just don't really see the point or importance anymore. Been struggling with my mental health problems for over twenty years--two thirds of my life--and I feel like I haven't moved anywhere.

I think about this the same way I think of my mother and her siblings. They are all in their 40s/50s, they all had trash childhoods and whatnot, but my mother was the only one able to pull herself up by her bootstraps, raise four children (the fifth one died of crib death), spend much of her 20s and 30s being sucked dry by her parasitic siblings, and make *something* out of herself, and I'm really proud of her. But I also think about her brothers/my uncles stuck in the same vicious cycles they've been stuck in for literally as long as I've been a part of this world. And I see this whole mental health struggle of mine turning into one of those vicious cycles.

So... Like I said, I've been dealing with this for twenty years at least. And it's not so much that I'm ""sad"" (because I've grown bored of being ""sad""), it's not so much that I'm angry (because I'm bored of that too), nor am I particularly confused (as that has also lost it's novelty too). I feel as though I've taken a step back and looked at all of this for what it really is, as far as what this particular individual is concerned. There really is no point to any of this.

There really is no point. I've spent twenty years going back and forth with medications with all these side effects, and then I have to take two and three more medications to deal with the side effects of the first pill, and MORE pills to deal with the side effects of the pills that are supposed to STOP the sided effects that started this whole geschichte to begin with. I've been back and forth with therapist after therapist who don't really have anything unique or interesting to say from one another. Been back and forth with psych ward stays who pump me full of meds to ""stabilize"" me and send me on my way. Been back and forth with myself, turning over a new leaf and finding a new outlook on life, only for that disingenuous outlook and view to drain me emotionally as I try to keep it up, and back and forth with the emotions themselves because that's literally what schizo-affective bipolar is. Been back and forth with friends and family, but same with the doctors: these Hallmark greeting card platitudes, as well as all of these multi-paragraph and multi-faceted contradictions about why I'm supposed to stay here as everyone else's source of supply and validation, when I can't even supply to and validate myself.

Basically, I've reached a point in my life where I'm just completely bored with this whole struggle, I'm no longer fascinated with (my) mental health, and I'm tired of fighting the same challenger for a reward that doesn't even seem like its worth it anymore.

Don't know how long I have at this point. I was hoping for to wait for another seven years (hell, I should at least allow myself that, right?), but last time I stopped my mental health treatment, I crumbled to dust in about three months.

,SuicideWatch,"First off, if you're reading this , I'm going to assume that you're feeling really down , maybe even suicidal. I want to say that I'm sorry for your pain and suffering. 

I suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts up until about 5 months ago. There is hope. As long as you tough it out , you're allowing for the opportunity to come for things in your life to get better. If you take your own life, that chance of your life ever getting better goes away. 

Here's what's helped me get better. 

1. Medication- this was probably the biggest game changer for me. I had severe depression for so long that my brain needed help to get back to being happy again. 

2. Try to change your perspective- instead of being sad , try appreciating every little and big good thing in your life. Write down all of the positive things that you can think of in your life , read it everyday as a reminder of you have to. 

3. Spend time in nature and in the sun- Both nature and the sun can improve your mood. Fresh air is great. Watching animals is a fun way to pass time. Even going out at night to look at the stars is a good way to pass time.

4. Journal- when you're feeling down or even happy .. take time out of your day or week to Journal and get your thoughts out on paper. Keep it to reflect on , or burn it if you choose to. 

5. Cut toxic people out of your life - this can help you feel a lot better. People that are toxic to you can potentially bring you down!

6. Take a break from social media and unfollow , unfriend , or even block people that you don't like - seeing people on your friend's list that you are no longer close with or had a falling out with can really bring you down. It can also bring you down when you compare your life to their lives. Remember, people only show you what they want you to see on their social media. 

7. Get enough sleep- for me personally if I don't get enough sleep.. my depression can come back in full swing. I become irritated and sad. 

8. Hygiene- keeping up with your personal hygienic needs.. like taking a shower and brushing your teeth before bed can really make you feel a lot better. 

9. Set goals - either small or big or both!

10. Time- give yourself time. Don't cut your life short over feelings that are temporary.

I knelt down and put my head to the floor. I shut out her noise but the demons a Roar.   
No where to go no one to see. No one I can sit on the couch and hear them family out.  
No. It was just mw. No one nor comfort at all. So so so alone and my world pile of shit.  
I said you better go she still went on.  
I cut my leg open the worst i have done. I exploded with fear at the sight of my wound she didnt notice the sky had no moon.   
She saw what I had done and was shocked and I was numb  
My god how I bled. I knew was too much I knew this was it. That terror that mighty terror filled all my all apologising apologising to everyone. Then thought of my cats and then that was the hardest to imagine them wondering where I am for the rest of their precious lives.  
Then the acceptance   
acceptance waves breaking  
acceptance stars  
acceptance jupiter I was at a beach no people no one at all.  
i flipped my switch and knew no other way.   
Acceptance so much confusion. This is it?  
""Where is the ambulance?""  
""At trinity""  
Thats like whale beach to collaroy.  
I knew that was it id gone to far. All my own doing.  
I said ""tell them to forget about it"" I gave up and stopped trying to live I closed my eyes. Flashed every car that went past they didnt stop I dont blame them but for someone else would have been danger.  
Then all of a sudden blue red lights and Im up into and away. Thanks for saving me and if you dont see disappointed id be. My gaslighter became my hero my lifesaver what a cruel world. 5 hours later stitched up and shown the door. I took some shots of the dawn. In total shock still I am. All I remember is the acceptance the peacfulness.   
But I have learnt nothing. I gave a hug and devoted myself to my gaslighter. She went ballistic at me a few hours later. Normal friends is what I need. Not psychotic mirrors with teeth.  
The lonliness is worse than ever my concentration levels are going and I think of negativity.  
I feel cast aside for more important. I am no one and its hard to accept. I want to finish one thing. but I cant. I cant edit photos anymore the self doubt crushes me and i just give up. I need a reason I need a purpose.

No. It was just mw. No one nor comfort at all. So so so alone and my world pile of shit.&lt;br/&gt;
I said you better go she still went on.&lt;br/&gt;
I cut my leg open the worst i have done. I exploded with fear at the sight of my wound she didnt notice the sky had no moon.&lt;br/&gt;
She saw what I had done and was shocked and I was numb&lt;br/&gt;
My god how I bled. I knew was too much I knew this was it. That terror that mighty terror filled all my all apologising apologising to everyone. Then thought of my cats and then that was the hardest to imagine them wondering where I am for the rest of their precious lives.&lt;br/&gt;
Then the acceptance&lt;br/&gt;
acceptance waves breaking&lt;br/&gt;
acceptance stars&lt;br/&gt;
acceptance jupiter I was at a beach no people no one at all.&lt;br/&gt;
i flipped my switch and knew no other way.&lt;br/&gt;
Acceptance so much confusion. This is it?&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;Where is the ambulance?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;At trinity&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
Thats like whale beach to collaroy.&lt;br/&gt;
I knew that was it id gone to far. All my own doing.&lt;br/&gt;
I said &amp;quot;tell them to forget about it&amp;quot; I gave up and stopped trying to live I closed my eyes. Flashed every car that went past they didnt stop I dont blame them but for someone else would have been danger.&lt;br/&gt;
Then all of a sudden blue red lights and Im up into and away. Thanks for saving me and if you dont see disappointed id be. My gaslighter became my hero my lifesaver what a cruel world. 5 hours later stitched up and shown the door. I took some shots of the dawn. In total shock still I am. All I remember is the acceptance the peacfulness.&lt;br/&gt;
But I have learnt nothing. I gave a hug and devoted myself to my gaslighter. She went ballistic at me a few hours later. Normal friends is what I need. Not psychotic mirrors with teeth.&lt;br/&gt;
The lonliness is worse than ever my concentration levels are going and I think of negativity.&lt;br/&gt;
I feel cast aside for more important. I am no one and its hard to accept. I want to finish one thing. but I cant. I cant edit photos anymore the self doubt crushes me and i just give up. I need a reason I need a purpose.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks fo letting me vent I cant hold this or hide it. I am in perpetual doubt and a grinning demon handing me the pain&lt;/p&gt;

I felt i wasn’t ready to become a medical professional at that point and my family lashed out on me to the point threatened to beat me up and disown me. Note that i am a student that gets high grades and always on top of my class but this one event where i failed resulted in my family treating me differently. Lately im so lost and i want to end it and the only thing thats keeping me from killing myself is the girl that helped me through this. I don’t think she can handle me dying of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Consciousness is just self flagellation at this point. There's no way out and the ROI on existence gets deeper in the red every hour.

Every day I seem to have a less 'get up and go' than the prior one. Everything I try, or do, seems to fail miserably. I get walloped with unexpected bad news on a regular basis, and I feel constantly as though the next big thing will be the one that finally pushes me over the edge, exhausts any last bit of hope. I'll never get out of debt, my parents are only getting older and poorer and sicker, and I feel like every day has a moment when I can see some light from outside this deep well in which I live but then, later, realize it's just an illusion. 

I get up the energy once or twice a week to apply for another job, something not soul-crushing, and yet despite dozens of applications I haven't so much as heard back.

I get walloped with unexpected bad news on a regular basis, and I feel constantly as though the next big thing will be the one that finally pushes me over the edge, exhausts any last bit of hope. I&amp;#39;ll never get out of debt, my parents are only getting older and poorer and sicker, and I feel like every day has a moment when I can see some light from outside this deep well in which I live but then, later, realize it&amp;#39;s just an illusion. &lt;/p&gt;

I wake up and my day is ruined, reminded  by the fact that I have to bear the sadness and nothingness until I finally do it. 

You know that feeling when you are just sitting there and waiting for the bus to arrive? Or you're standing in a line with a bunch of people, or you're broke and you're waiting for your salary. That's how I feel nowadays. I'm just waiting to die. Sitting idly. Waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting...

I can't defeat my body. I've tried to kill myself 3 times in the past. Every time, there is this force that keeps me from doing it. I just freeze at the moment. Yet, I regret failing to do it every single day. I wish I had killed myself at the first opportunity.

I am a living contradiction. I'm an enigma, a paradox. Nothing makes sense inside of me. I yearn for interaction, connection to feel related to others, but I am inherently unable to relate with anyone. Because of my personality deep down, I strive to be different than anyone else. And I hate the fact that I try to be different than anyone else. I'm alone on this whole earth, and the loneliness is killing me. I care for others, yet I don't really care about anything at all. I search for something that doesn't exist. I do things that I don't want to do. Knowing that this world is just suffering, I am unable to relieve my self from it.

I know that everyone has problems and I acknowledge that people have problems. But the thing is, I wish I had problems, I wish my life was dramatic, and I had ups and downs. I wish I felt fear, I wish I felt anxious. I wish I felt excitement. But I feel nothing, my constant state of mind is below a regular person's saddest day. My happiest day is below a regular person's normal day.

Whether or not I even want to be happy is an another story. Deep down I feel like I want to be happy. But how can you yearn for something that'll never happen. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing makes me excited. I tried to get help, see therapists, and it didn't work. Maybe the problem is just inherently in my mindset.

,SuicideWatch,"No money, phone is off, no car or driving privileges, live in the middle of nowhere with my mom. I failed her, I failed myself. I have all this stuff I have to try to sell, I guess a small garage sale will do it. I'd make a lot more selling online but I have no transportation or money for shipping so at most I'll get 5% of what my stuff is worth and that's just so it's out of everybody's hands. Trying to figure out what I can fit in my backpack because I can't burden my mother anymore so being homeless is the only choice have left. On the other hand I might not have a choice but to stay with her because I am still on probation for a DUI I got last year and I don't know how far away I am allowed to move or if I will have to start the required substance abuse counseling over again or how I will be able to comply with it. I have nothing, I have no one, I am losing everything, getting no value for anything I own because I don't have enough money to do things like sell my car through private sale properly. I don't even feel right having my mother pay for the fee to downgrade my liscence to a photo ID. I don't understand why the photo ID isn't free if you need it to participate in society. If I can't make it through the rest of probation due to no transportation or whatever I am afraid they will make me sit in jail for two months. Everyone acts like it's no big deal but if that happens I will be even more lost and even more far away from anyone who could remotely help me. When you're done they just let you out with whatever possessions we're on you and you have to do who knows what. In an unfamiliar area with no map and no way to call someone to come get me.

I failed her, I failed myself. I have all this stuff I have to try to sell, I guess a small garage sale will do it. I&amp;#39;d make a lot more selling online but I have no transportation or money for shipping so at most I&amp;#39;ll get 5% of what my stuff is worth and that&amp;#39;s just so it&amp;#39;s out of everybody&amp;#39;s hands. Trying to figure out what I can fit in my backpack because I can&amp;#39;t burden my mother anymore so being homeless is the only choice have left. On the other hand I might not have a choice but to stay with her because I am still on probation for a DUI I got last year and I don&amp;#39;t know how far away I am allowed to move or if I will have to start the required substance abuse counseling over again or how I will be able to comply with it. I have nothing, I have no one, I am losing everything, getting no value for anything I own because I don&amp;#39;t have enough money to do things like sell my car through private sale properly. I don&amp;#39;t even feel right having my mother pay for the fee to downgrade my liscence to a photo ID. I don&amp;#39;t understand why the photo ID isn&amp;#39;t free if you need it to participate in society. If I can&amp;#39;t make it through the rest of probation due to no transportation or whatever I am afraid they will make me sit in jail for two months. Everyone acts like it&amp;#39;s no big deal but if that happens I will be even more lost and even more far away from anyone who could remotely help me. When you&amp;#39;re done they just let you out with whatever possessions we&amp;#39;re on you and you have to do who knows what.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m not really looking for advice, just need to get this off my chest. I have suffered enough abuse at the hands of psychiatry and medicine in general.

Last minute my surgeon fell ill and I was transferred to another one who was less experienced. Word of advice: *don’t ever let this happen to you*. I got mutilated. Horrifically.

It’s been a few months. I shower once a week, sleep all day and forget to eat. I am weak and sickly, often too lethargic to leave my bed. I did not heal. My scars keep reopening. My body is irrecoverably damaged. There is absolutely nothing I can do about it. Not a single day goes by without me wanting to kill myself. I gave up. I had plans for the future but I know I will not survive.

I wish I let it kill me instead of getting that surgery. It was supposed to save me. I lost sensation in half of my body while some areas can only feel pain. I find it hard to so much as get up, let alone shower or change my clothes. I don’t leave my house. I don’t have an appetite anymore. I look in the mirror and I cry. Every time. I am merely a shell of a human being. There is nothing behind my eyes anymore.

I love my partner, but I lied. We can’t be together forever. I am slowly dying and I will be gone soon. He has shown me nothing but love. I was his only hope. He was my only hope. He says when I’m gone he no longer has a purpose. I will have blood on my hands.

&lt;p&gt;Last minute my surgeon fell ill and I was transferred to another one who was less experienced. Word of advice: &lt;em&gt;don’t ever let this happen to you&lt;/em&gt;. I got mutilated. Horrifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a few months. I shower once a week, sleep all day and forget to eat. I am weak and sickly, often too lethargic to leave my bed. I did not heal. My scars keep reopening. My body is irrecoverably damaged. There is absolutely nothing I can do about it. Not a single day goes by without me wanting to kill myself. I gave up. I had plans for the future but I know I will not survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I let it kill me instead of getting that surgery. It was supposed to save me. I lost sensation in half of my body while some areas can only feel pain. I find it hard to so much as get up, let alone shower or change my clothes. I don’t leave my house. I don’t have an appetite anymore. I look in the mirror and I cry. Every time. I am merely a shell of a human being. There is nothing behind my eyes anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my partner, but I lied. We can’t be together forever. I am slowly dying and I will be gone soon. He has shown me nothing but love. I was his only hope. He was my only hope. He says when I’m gone he no longer has a purpose. I will have blood on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"The title explains itself. If there was a pistol, right next to me at all times, I guarantee you I would not be typing this message. I've had more mental breakdowns this past weekend than I've had in fucking months.

These problems don't just come and go for me. They always leave a scar, that I've been refusing to acknowledge for quite some time. Now, I'll acknowledge it. It hurts. Everytime another mental breakdown starts, it always hurts more than the last and makes the scar bigger for it to hurt even more the next time.

It hurts so much that if I was presented with the opportunity to off myself during any point these past few days, I would definitely take that opportunity in a heartbeat. But, it's never presented itself. Always locked away in a closet, in a place I'm not supposed to be in. That fact has singlehandedly done more to prevent my suicide than half the shit I hear coming from others online.

I've given up on most of my goals. I don't feel like preserving myself for any reason whatsoever. I deserve all this shit anyways. I've been a dick to the only people who could save me, and allied with those that beat me down to a bloody pulp. And then there's the fact that I'm worthless. Thousands of people die everyday and the world moves on. Adding to that list won't do anything. In 30 years, those that loved me will have been remember a false version of me, and those that see this post will forget I ever fucking existed in a matter of weeks.

I may indeed be loved, but I haven't been true to anyone in years. They love a cardboard cuttout of a kid who claims to be a man, and they'll remember me as that, even when I'm gone. The truth is, the moment I'll be the most me I will ever be is the moment I pull the trigger and my brains splatter against the wall. That moment will be the one time in my life people will see me for who I am, realize all of the signs and signals I've been throwing at, connect the dots and find my true character, and they'll fucking ignore it.",t2_c9f3o1ri,False,,0,False,The only gun in the house being upstairs in my parent's bedroom has saved me more than anything else,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_wf6czy,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1659532545.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title explains itself.
