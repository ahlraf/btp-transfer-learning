,EdAnonymousAdults,"Gained 8 pounds but .5 pounds sends me into a downward spiral of how to loose it…I hate this crap 😂fckkkk why can’t I just be happy already god damn it lol
I want to go back to restricting so bad 💀 I’m gonna try running at the park in the morning so I can try and balance things out healthier.
If I go back to restricting, I’ll binge and then purge. But because I’ve been having trouble purging I’ll gain. And that number will continue to rise not to mention the damage I’ll be causing to my body.
At the moment that’s why I’ve gained. I want to gain by simply eating right and not from failed purges. I’ve been craving cheese and fats in general so tomorrow I’ll try and get something with that down. But fuckin hell. The gaining in general when I look b at myself is so damn Devastating…I hate it. When I was well below the uw mark I felt so happy mentally being able to look at myself but felt so damn shitty physically. And now I feel like shit mentally and “well enough” to do basic physical activities. I can start working out again and such. But omg. 😭😂 I’m barely eating and I’m gaining so rapidly. (Ik it’s cause the failed purges but I’ve also been semi eating) Like I’ll eat a 100cals two hours before my normal b/p times so I can force myself to keep something down. My metabolism isn’t to bad surprisingly. From cheat days I’ll gain like two pounds and thats about avg. If I restrict during the week I’ll loose about 3. (With successful b/p) and without b/p I’ll loose about 5lb. I’ll maintain with failed b/p.. So thats how Ive managed to get up to 8lbs gained. A cheat on weekends and a week of failed b/p. I reckon if I just eat normally and balance out my meals. I’ll be able to simply maintain where I’m at. But I’m scared. Like actually scared that if I eat normally without casting out cals through binging then purging I’ll gain significantly more instead of maintaining.  I hate this thinking. 

(I just need a place to tell people my thinking cause paper has a special loneliness to it lol, posting makes me feel less alone honestly)

(I generally crave veg, fruit, fats, meat and chocolate. If I’m craving carbs it’s usually straight up white bread. My strong cravings being fruit, ubread and chocolate. I like dark chocolate 😂😂 like fuck. (((All of which are safe foods!!! 🙄))) 

Like the ONe hurdle I’m having is being able to eat in bigger quantities. Like eating anything over 100 cals in a single session is so Daunting. I managed to lift it to 270 but then I feel the need to not eat for the rest of the day which as we all know by now results in binging and guilt: then with me “purgingggggggg 🫠 we’ll fail purges haha

Anywho it’s just a constant struggle is all. Like I can’t say I’m happy gaining 8lbs because I feel like ass when I look at myself now. Plus I didn’t do it in the best way possible 😬😓

Think I might post diary entrees on here about my struggles , any suggestions on where it’ll be allowed ? (Subreddits)

Oo and I haven’t been obsessed with rereading what I post so that’s why it’s everywhere. (I used to be hella subconscious about how people view and read my post in fear of being judged or upsetting people)

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Hi all. Let me know if this isn’t the right sub for my questions/processing. TIA

TW for mentions of medical testing, food, weight loss, exercise, etc. (no specific numbers)

Recently I had routine blood work and my numbers indicate pre-diabetes. I’ve been researching how to prevent pre-diabetes from developing into full on diabetes. Most of it has to do with addressing diet and body movement. 

I’m honestly a bit confused and triggered by these results from my blood tests. I’ve always had blood sugar readings on the lower end, and suddenly they’re high. My triglycerides have historically been within range, and suddenly they’re all messed up. All of this is coming after months of losing weight in a HEALTHY WAY. Not engaging my ED to the best of my ability. 

It has taken me a long time to get to a point where I can lose weight without triggering my ED, and now this pre-diabetes diagnosis is thrown into the mix. It feels like a huge monkey wrench. 

I guess my question is: should I begin focusing on all of the aspects that the WHO and CDC recommend for preventing diabetes? These include staying away from certain fats, increasing body movement, losing weight (which I’m already doing), etc. I’m fearful that doing so will trigger my ED further, but I’m also terrified of developing diabetes.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Yesterday I drank a lot. Ate unsafe foods. Purged. Drank more. Ate more unsafe foods. Passed out and woke up today around 9am. 
Then I found out that me and my family were gonna go out to eat later for lunch (1pm). 
Long story short I caved and made an excuse I had to get my card inside and that they could wait in the car a bit. 
I go inside, open the top cabinet and take out the bottle of lax I had hidden. I drink three servings and meet them back in the car.

Fast forward we’re at the restaurant and I put up with same crap that always happen when i order steamed veg.

“Do you mean this (points to a greasy asf fck stir fry)?”

No, I’m sorry could I just have some plain steamed broccoli?

“Oh well we have this. (Points to different oily garbage)Is that what you want? I’m sorry I don’t understand what your trying to order.”

Can I have plain, just plain broccoli, on a plate with nothing else on it? That’s all I would like please. Just plain broccoli on a plate. 

“Oh well I’m not sure if they do that, but I’ll ask.”

Rest of the table orders and food arrives.

*sets a plate of steamed carrots and broccoli down in front of me”

Thank you.

Fast forward past the non stop comments of “you want some” “that’s all your eating” “here have this”. We enter the annoying small talk.

Brother-in-law: “I’m already getting full. I don’t think I can take another bite.”
(Referring to the appetizer of egg drop soup that was served in a tea cup sized bowl🙄)

Sister: “Yea me too.” (While main course’s are being delivered to table)

They ate their food while continuously saying they were full. My sister ate like three pieces and was pretending to be stuffed. Her husband ate like half of his massive portion. Ughhh Like “okay????” Like omfg why is it y’all get so damn full after two bites of fuckin food and still weigh xxx pounds?? Like y’all eat when y’all go home, y’all eat crap all the time. But only when we go out do y’all pick at y’all plates. Ik for damn sure when y’all head home with y’all leftovers your both going to eat that in addition to that stupid ice cream you kept pushing on me. Why can’t we just go out and have actual small talk?? No. Better yet let’s stay home! Let’s stay home and I’ll cook for y’all. It’ll taste better and I wouldn’t waste 82 fuckin dollars on food your just gonna fuckin peck at. Like bro ughh I’m not paying for us to go eat food. I’m paying for the day out. To eat out. That’s why it’s pricey. The least y’all could do.
Anyway. It’s bad enough to have to do the whole damn back and forth with the waiter and whoever they need to bring over to “clarify” and make an even bigger scene. But holly shit I can’t even enjoy the overly priced rabbit food? I gotta listen to these people who are getting free food talk badly about my mom while she’s their. I CANNOT SPEAK UP. I can’t. I’ve tried, and I’m immediately left completely with denial and self hate for not being able to. I hate them. Honest to god the fact that their so fuckin judgmental. Jesus fuckin Christ. Like the waiter made a comparison between me and my sister that we looked like my mom. Instead of letting my mom get just a lil bit of enjoyment from it cause she’s been so stressed with moving and been trying to get me to go back on my word and move in with her 😒😞(I’ll worsen my stupid ED, you’ll understand that at the end)My sister gave this upsetting almost disgusted look and looked at her husband at which he replied with justifying it. He said “oh the waiter just said it to be nice. It’s just a phrase. He didn’t mean it.” 🤨??
My mom sat their in silence and just smiled while trying to enjoy her food. I just stayed silent b/c I’m tired of having to stick up for her and just be ment with walls on all sides..I- 

I’m just so damn drained from these last two days. Like omfg man. Once I’m back home and they leave I have to listen to my brothers degrade her worth and the food she just bought for them (50+$)
I gotta listen to her complaining about how full she is, how it hurts etc etc. 

Like ughhh I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense. I’m just so done with my family. I’m tired of this ED crap too. Everything just makes me want to unalive myself nowadays. I don’t feel like I have a voice. I just want out already. I want out. Take it, take everything just leave me alone. For fuck sakes. 

I can’t wait to move. Ik it won’t take away my worries but it’ll give me a place to go away and breath. Just fuckin breath man. Anyway once I got home I went to bed waking up occasionally to take a dump. (3-4pm) Speed a couple hours later and I finish off the bottle of lax, make some detox tea and eat a fiber one bar.
It’s so hard keeping my stupid b/p crap in order though with how my family behaves. I’m aware they all prolly struggle with disordered eating but Jesus Christ. I’m trying, why can’t y’all help me a little bit and just acknowledge what’s y’all doing is fucking me up even more? Ik that sounds selfish but all my worries come from a place of love. Ok what I said and it’s (typed) said from irritation with everything b/c we don’t talk like a normal family. Everyone has their own head up their ass and doesn’t just want to come to a damn agreement. And I’m just tired of picking up their pieces already. Hence why I’m moving and trying to recover b/c I’m not going to stay here. If I must stay here, stay breathing and all that crap. I’m not going on like this. Aight no damn way. I’m going to live right by me. I’m getting my voice back again. 

Sorry this was hella long, if you managed to read this far you care more then most people and I just want to tell you thank you for listening. You have no idea how much that means to me especially in the current state I’m in. 🥹🥹💕

Don’t worry :) I’m staying up tonight and I’m just gonna relax with my detox tea and watch non food or ED related crap on YouTube. (Still working on cleaning my medias of ED or triggers lol)

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams I am a Graduate student at Rogers State University, and I am doing a research project on eating disorders for males. More specifically if there is some type of trauma in your childhood is there an increased risk of developing an eating disorder in the male population. Males have been overlooked for a long time in this research and I want to change that. This is completely confidential, no personal identifiers are asked nor shared. 

You can stop at any time if you feel triggered or uncomfortable. I am looking for 

300 males to complete my 2 surveys which should take between 10-15 minutes. Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope to shed more light on this subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link which you will read and sign the informed consent, then continue towards the surveys. Have a great day.

The cassette catches the reel. 

The magnetic tape weakens. At that point of contact it finally tares. 

Those pre-recorded lines seem to become corrupted. 

Those words are no longer binary products of an eating disorder. 

As quickly as they were created to sooth the suspicions, the behaviors, the absences, the many many rules. 

Something loosened the tension to the point of a slack hemp rope. 

I forget the most important object in my life is my eating disorder. 

I just risked losing it, risked removing it's reticence, risked its restraint, jeopardized the cold comfort it sets in my life. 

""I never eat more then 1000Kcals a day, if I do....Well I will run that off no matter how late it is. I mean I have ran at 2am. Well closer to 3am, 4am.""

I suddenly become a synonym for fear. 

My eyes narrow. My throat dries........

I feel the tension tighten. 

I can't fill my lungs with oxygen. I cannot for the length of that conversation comprehend the mayhem of the chaos I have summoned. 

I think please don't take this away from Me. 

Don't look any further. 

Do not push against the open door....don't regret Your kindness or confuse guilt for support.

Like that the vain fearful nature of Humanity tempers any further inquiry. The comment goes unattended.  

No surprised tone, No judgement of erratic behavior, No reflection on my words which by an act of exhaustion have been liberated from the Scribes Quill. 

The statemen has been redacted from general publication. 

Omitted from public consumption. 

I feel almost pious. August despite my chains. 

Maybe she knew or simply is too ineffectual to care. 

You see my friend You cannot fail to project the signs of anorexia no matter the size of the stage or the time taken to thread the boards. No prop can obscure my thin shoulders. Nor can any scenery deflect from My Gaunt face. Nothing but the final applause can hide the lost years of my life. 

Maybe my Anorexia is Lady Macbeth, My bulimia that Scottish play that must not be spoken and Drunkorexia had spoken my words to the frailty of the Danish Prince's Madness. 

Did She know “Fair is Foul, Foul is Fair” or that ""My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.""

Though I would reason no one seems to reflect on my efforts to my treasons.... but they are my reasons… Mine and Mine to live alone. 

Like the meticulous nature of a sunrise or sunset in its benign nature the malevolent attributes of concern pass.

I reset....Call to my understudy line, line fucking line now.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"So…the long story short, I contacted a hospital in early July to ask about their eating disorders programs- they have a partial hospitalization program and an intensive outpatient program. The ball had really been rolling for me to take an extended leave from work from September-December to attend these programs and find a way out of this.

Until yesterday. The man I spoke to is going to speak to the dietician today and make a case for me, but I might not be able to be vegan in treatment. I’m in panic mode right now. He knows it’s an ethical lifestyle for me, but he’s concerned about diversity of food options and balancing nutritional content. I’m freaking out. He’s going to call me today, most likely. I suggested bringing in my own foods after working with the dietitians to make sure they meet requirements, and he said he would mention that.

I have been vegan for almost 15 years, and it was NEVER used to fuel my disorder. I told him that it actually opened up a whole new world for me with food. If he calls with bad news today, I’m going to tell him that I won’t be doing the program then, and that it’s a shame that rather than work with someone on fixing unhealthy and disordered coping mechanisms, they’d prefer someone to abandon an entire belief system.

I see copious posts like this in the Marriage and RelationshipAdvice subreddits. The OP *always* mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks ‘how to point out that there spouse has gained weight.’ They always make sure to include that their wife/sometimes husband looked “amazing and fit/like a supermodel” and was really into going to the gym/eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. But how should you point it out? Literally fucking don’t. 

I’m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn’t already have one. 

My abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight (I was always at a very healthy BMI) and compared my body to the bodies of other women. But he would constantly tell me how “perfect” I would be if I just lost ten pounds, putting me in the UW category. Looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. He is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that I can’t shake a decade later. 

And the comments in these posts are LOADED with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like ‘suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together/getting a gym membership.’ ‘Maybe it’s a mental health issue/binge eating.’ And there are always even worse comments like, ‘you’re still young and haven’t been married long. You should get out while you can.’ ‘Your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their ✨helth✨.’ Fuck that.

People would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over FUCKING WEIGHT GAIN. Like, are you serious? I have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women NATURALLY look like supermodels. It is a full fucking time JOB to look anything remotely close to that. It is an illness. It is exhausting. 

And bodies are SUPPOSED to change. But how can I ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? I am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. In fact, he always finds me most attractive when I feel like I look like a hot mess (sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc.). He has never expected me to look a certain way/pressured me to be thin. But it’s terrifying. I am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which I do still struggle with.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Recently moved in with roommates, which I think will be good for me long term but I'm worried that I'm going to end up loosing it and binge all of their ""forbidden"" food they keep all over the place. 

I am trying to recover for 2 months now (trying to find a therapist specialized in ED but so far I will have to just rely on my regular therapist until I find someone more versed in this issue) and I'm not restricting myself in calories any longer. 

However when I tried going full ""eat whatever you want"" mode I just end up binging bad. I'm not at that stage yet where I feel like I can just let go of the reins completely. I have been able to have pretty good success with just focusing on eating healthy and ""maintenance"" calories, and keeping my triggers out of the house.

But now with moving into this new place with all of my triggers everywhere... I just don't really know how to handle it. I already ate a little bit of something that wasn't mine after spending two days thinking about it nonstop and telling myself not to do it. 

I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. 

It's one thing hurting myself with my ED but it's going to effect other people possibly too ... 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, does anyone have any advice on how to compartmentalize my ED so that I don't end up eating other people's food?

Update:

Definitely feel a binge is inevitable. Well I made it two weeks without restricting/binging. That's longer than... Well I can't really remember when actually. Maybe I'm giving up too soon but right now everything just feel a little too much.

My name is Jenn, I am a former anorexia sufferer and currently doing a Master in Psychology.

We are seeking participants over the age of 16 years who are in recovery/ recovered or remission from Anorexia Nervosa. To take part in a qualitative study to share their experiences of recovery and how their mindset has been affected during the recovery process.

This research is in collaboration with the University of Chester school of psychology and has been given full ethical approval. This study will be asking individuals personal questions relating to their recovery journey including mental health, depressive thoughts and thoughts around suicidality. Therefore, we invite only those who feel able and comfortable disclosing their experiences to take part in the study. All who identify as experiencing Anorexia Nervosa are welcome to participate. You do not need to currently have or have had a formal clinical diagnosis to participate in this study.

If you decided to participate, or seek further information on that study (e.g., how your data will be used, inclusion and what questions will be asked), please click the following link to access participant information.

The study is voluntary and should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. However, there is no time limit. Your wellbeing is important to us, so please be aware that some questions could cause distress. Only take part if you are comfortable doing so. Should you find any question triggering or feel unable to continue with the questionnaire you are under no obligation to continue and can withdraw at any point. Any information provided will be kept anonymous and treated with complete confidentially.

Many thanks

Please give me your best tips on how to handle the ED self-hate dialogue.

I had 6,000 calories yesterday and about 5,000 calories today. I just finished a bowl of lo mein and bourbon chicken at 11pm and that was after eating a full pint of full fat ice cream, chocolate, Oreos, Greek yogurt, a REAL pb&amp;j and chips. Knowing I will wake up again tomorrow feeling even heavier than today is almost too much to mentally endure. The ED part of me wants to down laxatives to get rid of the food and water weight. The edema is unbearable in every way.

But so is having my ED tell me I am a failure for fucking eating. For literally giving my body what it needs to function.

I’m trying to talk myself out of going for my long run again tomorrow that I tell myself I enjoy. But it’s pretty fucking hard to enjoy anything when you are beyond exhausted from restriction. I managed to successfully rest and lay around all day today. I’m forcing myself to sit with the discomfort, but fuck is it virtually impossible to do.

I want to cry and scream, but I’m also so weirdly happy and giddy that I finally am allowing myself to eat without rules. I love food. Food is delicious. Food makes me happy. So much delicious food.

I broke down to my husband tonight because I realized he has never known me without my ED and I desperately want for both of us to meet that person someday. I knew her a long time ago, but that person also dealt with severe Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I had never known her to be confident and comfortable in her own skin. She wore leather jackets in 90 degree heat and still compared herself to everyone else. She still never measured up. 

And I know I am not my ED, but for the past ten years, I have felt like I *am* my ED. It’s not living when all you think about is getting to finally eat your next meal. 

Not being able to make memories and really *be* in the present moment with the people you love because you are obsessing over your daily caloric intake in your head, and mentally planning meals out for the week ahead or agonizing over every bite when at a social function because you don’t know the exact calorie count. I’m always tired. I’m always irritated. I’m just always fucking miserable.

Part of me is truly fucking done living this way. I still hear my ED part and it’s still trying to drown out everything else, but the part that is fucking fed up with this bullshit is starting to sound much louder than it did before.

I just finished a bowl of lo mein and bourbon chicken at 11pm and that was after eating a full pint of full fat ice cream, chocolate, Oreos, Greek yogurt, a REAL pb&amp;amp;j and chips. Knowing I will wake up again tomorrow feeling even heavier than today is almost too much to mentally endure. The ED part of me wants to down laxatives to get rid of the food and water weight. The edema is unbearable in every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so is having my ED tell me I am a failure for fucking eating. For literally giving my body what it needs to function.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Today was a real mixed bag of fucking ridiculousness, I just feel like I want to talk as my husband will not understand and I don't talk to my therapist about this stuff. 

I've gained some weight due to the fact that my entire family and myself have pretty much been sick with one virus or another since probably March. So I've been home either sick or caring for sick children, and my food and exercise routines are all out of whack. From August last year till around two months ago, I was finally almost at my lifetime ""goal weight"" (which forever changes, but I was very much in the ballpark and feeling SO GOOD about being on top of everything for once), but I've been thrown off course by all constant illness.

Today I went to my blood donation appointment. I had the interview beforehand and because my weight is a little higher than it was at my donation a month ago I was able to donate more blood today, which should be a good thing but of course I felt like a huge failure and so embarrassed.

We move to the donation chair. As usual, I had barely eaten beforehand, and hadn't drunk as much water as I should have, because one of my motivations for donating blood, (besides it being a good thing to do to help others) is to Burn Maximum Calories, i.e. by eating as little as I can before and after, to get the biggest calorie burn possible. I know this is all so ridiculous, and probably not even REAL. Normally it doesn't affect my donation, but the trip home can be a little lightheaded sometimes. Today, I was obviously dehydrated so the nurse missed the vein in one arm, and then when they got the vein in my other arm, it was a really slow flow of blood and blew out and caused a haematoma, so they couldn't proceed today.

So now I'm back home, I've got both elbows wrapped up, a large painful swollen arm and bruise where the vein blew, and I can't donate again till next week. I'm disappointed that my ridiculous restrictive behaviour and obsession meant that I wasn't able to donate. It's times like these I really notice how messed up my brain is. On the way home, I couldn't stop ruminating on the whole situation, I feel shame for having gained weight, and disappointment for not being able to donate and frustration and anxiety for my calorie burn plans being thwarted for today. I feel like I'll be a failure forever, my weight is out of my control and I'm basically out of control in life. No balance. I'm a grown adult with kids and marriage and a career, this shouldn't be what's happening for me.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I mostly identify as post-ED. I haven't purged in months and genuinely don't want to purge again. I have some days where I eat more than I should (but not an out-of-control binge) and some days where I eat below maintenance and feel fine. In doing so, my weight has been pretty stable, a high ""normal"" BMI, but I'm noticeably getting more fit as I've been consistently working out more. I feel satisfied that I look good enough, even if I could look better. I feel satisfied that I eat well enough, even if I could eat better. It's better.

So if I'm pretty much at peace, why would I want to get cosmetic procedures to change my body? Recovery warriors would decry my decision, saying I should learn to fully accept it as it is. But I thought it would be worth it, far more worth it than any ED behavior.

The idea behind CoolSculpting is that when fat cells in an area are pinched off, frozen to death, and eventually cleared by the immune system, it reduces the fat levels in the area *proportional* to the level of fat in the rest of your body. (As we know, fat gain and loss affects fat everywhere. Someone with a BBL won't lose her relatively big booty if she loses weight, and someone with chunks of fat removed from her breasts in a reduction won't get huge boobs again if she gains weight.) My desired results wouldn't be something I would have to micromanage daily. The long-term proportional change would persist at any weight (although it's most pronounced if you're not too lean but not too fat for a clear contrast - like me!).

The first thing I got was flanks. No matter whether I was at my fattest or my thinnest, I didn't like the inward dip. I thought my figure could look so much more womanly if only its width would keep smoothly increasing from my waist down to my hips.

For one side at a time, I endured the tight pinch of the applicators, the sharp cold that soon turned me numb, and the godawful massage afterwards to break up the hard crystallized fat. I thought I was going to look so newly shapely at an event later that week. Imagine my shock when I was told it was going to be extra swollen for days at first, and only after a month would I start seeing the difference, with final results after three months!

Once that time passed, I did notice. It felt weird for my hand to brush by my hip and feel a nothingness where the boundary of my body was once expected. It indeed gave me smoother uninterrupted curves, and my hipbones were pronounced the way they were at a lower weight before. I thought, *Thank you!* Now that I knew it worked, I booked my next appointment - tummy. They said they wouldn't do my upper abs because there wasn't enough fat to pinch, but I could do lower abs. Who wouldn't want a flatter lower belly, right?

This time, the two-minute massage was TORTURE. The fat had to be broken up vigorously over my organs, not backed by nearby bone; last time I couldn't help but go ""ah!"", but here I couldn't help but scream and cry. One minute has already felt like way too long (""is it almost done?!"") when I was told ""halfway there!"" For a week afterwards, my tummy was bruised and painfully swollen.

I'd like to say it worked. But I honestly don't know how my lower tummy would look different now at my level of fitness had I not done it. This seems to be a common ""didn't do anything"" area anecdotally unless you have a pronounced tummy and get multiple rounds.

My third appointment, since I couldn't do upper abs, was frontal bra line. The pinch hurt worse, but the massage was so easy, since the fat was being crushed over my rigid ribcage. Now I have ribcage definition at a higher weight than I've ever seen it, and my bras feel more comfortable. (Proper-fitting clothes feel much better on harder body mass.) I do wish I could've gotten upper abs to even it out, though, because I think my waist is less inwardly curved in comparison now.

Then I got CoolToning, better for tummies with less fat to lose (and also buttocks and thighs!). The magnetic stimulation feels bizarre; it makes your abs suck outward harder than EVER, painful at first but easy to adjust to. Not everyone can handle 100% intensity, but I could. The muscle toning is real. It gave nice results and pushed me further along in exercise progress.

I have no real conclusion to this post, it’s more me thinking aloud and interested in others input on the matter. I will say I feel this is more an issue with the other ED discussion sub than this one. This one does feel more cautious and careful to not purposefully trigger people.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple years ago, I decided to actually care about my health. Since that point I've considered myself to be in semi-recovery since I'm at least making an effort. There's been some ups and downs and some big steps forward. But in the last 6 months it's mostly been sliding backwards.

These days, I feel like my recovery is tenuous as fuck. If I didn't have a support system around me, I would most likely go back to all the behaviors I worked so hard to get rid of.

I remember how things were pre-recovery and I don't want to go back there. Definitely not. But today and tomorrow, it's easier to just do what feels natural, feels right, makes me feel good.

I know there are consequences but I feel like my mind fucks me over every time, telling me, ""X issue isn't due to your ED! You've been so healthy lately! It's probably something else!"" Maybe this sounds stupid like...obviously your increase in symptoms is due to an increase in disordered eating...but I guess I have a mental barrier there.

I keep having this feeling like I want to give up. I want to be done with all this. I don't want to relapse, I don't want to keep fighting for recovery, I just want this whole part of my life to be cancelled. I keep fantasizing about running away and changing my identity or whatever.

So I had an eating disorder as a teenager (pretty severe at times) from around 13 to 21. I'm now 29 and had spent the past number of years eating fairly normally, with a few remaining ""quirks"". However, I have experienced a lot of trauma in these years and have a number of other mental health issues, that were massively exacerbated by getting neuro-psychiatric long covid last year. I had been struggling with a neurological disorder for a number of years prior to this and everything got a lot worse with the infection. It also really affected my ability to eat food and my body started reacting to everything and I have ended up only having a few foods I can eat so I am currently on a very restrictive diet of only a few foods. I also started intermittent fasting so I would have fewer food reactions. So the way I interact with food resembles disordered eating superficially.   


However, I am not actively restricting food quantity and I am not making an effort to lose weight. But I also feel psychologically unable to force myself into purposefully gaining weight (which I should do, as I am a fair bit underweight now). That doesn't seem to be limited by physical symptoms but I can't seem to get into the mindset that would allow me to do this. Also, I have been spending quite a bit of time looking up celebrity bmis and weights, looking at photos of thin celebrities, examining my protruding bones in the mirror etc... And I think this is because things have been so incredibly hard that my brain resorted back to what it deemed to be a coping strategy in those teenage years: ""at least I am communicating my emotional pain through my body, even if that won't get anything addressed.""

I participated a lot in the online forums in the 2000s, especially Futurebird's Thin Pages. There were meetups etc, all sorts.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Apologies sometimes I feel it’s not my place to post here. 

It has been...

I would like to say some time, I think 5-6 years since recovery started and I describe myself as 2 maybe 3 years bulimia free. 

But moments carefully placed from time to time return me to the memories where I begin a process of emotional grieving and I mourn for the extreme aspects of my Eating Disorder that were so deeply loved with a cold mechanical passion.

As marble brings a cold prestige to a home.... Anorexia brought to me a sense of protection, while bulimia brought a sense of atonement. 

Life felt less coarse, less like a pitted cement surface to the touch and feel.

At the age of 38 slowly staggering towards my 39th birthday with the regret my drunkorexia accords me. 

I have one eye on the past which always feels so present with my vision very rarely slipping from my ED habits which seemed almost redundant now while also being so necessary. 

I exist in a spectrum of required thoughts and actions. Fasting, restricting and questioning the validity of the calories represented by that trick of the mind kj/kcal nil. 

I used to weep for the things I lost in the fire but now I know beyond truth that my only love and god taken talent was my eating disorder. 

As I stand at the checkout listening to the passive movement of time in beeps and sighs, I wait for the store clerk to ask ""Chewing Gum, Cat Food and lots and lots of alcohol. No food....""

I respond forgetting we are all ED suffers. Just not all with this sense of awareness so nurtured by time.......

""chewing gum is food. There’s Cat food in there too. The alcohol will sustain existence I guess."" 

As she hands me my change and I allow it to pass to the charity box which I don't read, contemplate, examine or allow the subject of the box to influence my day except the touch of the sun-bleached plastic now rigid by the passage of years and the indiscriminate clanking of the coins. 

I am brought back to that guilt I am so culpable of enshrining in that taste less remark that’s not fair to someone who is trying to be a human being with empathy and concern while I am resolved to be a creature not unlike a man. That is simply the product of many metal moving parts. 

""it’s hard giving up smoking. Good for You. Stick with it.""

""Oh the chewing gum....No I didn't give up smoking...I gave up food.""

When my operating system resets I remember I am not fully recovered. I am missing memory capacity and my data has been corrupted. 

So I agonise on that missing information. 

Then I realise that’s why I am so protective of My Eating Disorders. 

That’s why I feel guilty. 

That is why as I approach my forties my life seems less vast and ineffectual. 

Its feels less important and contradictory to my 20s and 30s. 

My Eat Disorder seems less of a burden and more of a sense of intimacy lost. My one true childhood love. My teenage reckless affection and my adult desire. 

When I become despondent or depressed by the loss of social contacts and contracts that I ended or lost. 

I remind myself the Moon can never fall in love with The Sun since neither will meet in the Day or the Night. Though they still pursue one another’s affections. 

Finally, I take comfort in the fact The moon can gaze upon the stars in all its glory. 

Slowly I am accepting the consolation..... I will not and no one will Love this creature made of mercury. 

But When I look up at night, I can see the stars. 

Thank You for reading I just wanted to write this. Where people would understand.

&lt;p&gt;But moments carefully placed from time to time return me to the memories where I begin a process of emotional grieving and I mourn for the extreme aspects of my Eating Disorder that were so deeply loved with a cold mechanical passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As marble brings a cold prestige to a home.... Anorexia brought to me a sense of protection, while bulimia brought a sense of atonement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life felt less coarse, less like a pitted cement surface to the touch and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 38 slowly staggering towards my 39th birthday with the regret my drunkorexia accords me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one eye on the past which always feels so present with my vision very rarely slipping from my ED habits which seemed almost redundant now while also being so necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exist in a spectrum of required thoughts and actions. Fasting, restricting and questioning the validity of the calories represented by that trick of the mind kj/kcal nil. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to weep for the things I lost in the fire but now I know beyond truth that my only love and god taken talent was my eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand at the checkout listening to the passive movement of time in beeps and sighs, I wait for the store clerk to ask &amp;quot;Chewing Gum, Cat Food and lots and lots of alcohol. No food....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respond forgetting we are all ED suffers. Just not all with this sense of awareness so nurtured by time.......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;chewing gum is food. There’s Cat food in there too. The alcohol will sustain existence I guess.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she hands me my change and I allow it to pass to the charity box which I don&amp;#39;t read, contemplate, examine or allow the subject of the box to influence my day except the touch of the sun-bleached plastic now rigid by the passage of years and the indiscriminate clanking of the coins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am brought back to that guilt I am so culpable of enshrining in that taste less remark that’s not fair to someone who is trying to be a human being with empathy and concern while I am resolved to be a creature not unlike a man. That is simply the product of many metal moving parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;it’s hard giving up smoking. Good for You. Stick with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh the chewing gum....No I didn&amp;#39;t give up smoking...I gave up food.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my operating system resets I remember I am not fully recovered. I am missing memory capacity and my data has been corrupted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I agonise on that missing information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realise that’s why I am so protective of My Eating Disorders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I feel guilty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why as I approach my forties my life seems less vast and ineffectual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its feels less important and contradictory to my 20s and 30s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Eat Disorder seems less of a burden and more of a sense of intimacy lost. My one true childhood love. My teenage reckless affection and my adult desire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I become despondent or depressed by the loss of social contacts and contracts that I ended or lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remind myself the Moon can never fall in love with The Sun since neither will meet in the Day or the Night. Though they still pursue one another’s affections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I take comfort in the fact The moon can gaze upon the stars in all its glory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly I am accepting the consolation..... I will not and no one will Love this creature made of mercury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But When I look up at night, I can see the stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank You for reading I just wanted to write this. Where people would understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be safe be well, be good to Yourself and allow others to be good to You.&lt;/p&gt;

1. it happens more frequent and it has become more severe 
2. my binges are carb-heavy (400-860 grams of carbs per day with even more than 5kgs of solid food) and I know if I continue to binge, I will die young, I'm just 18 and I have great academic achievements,

I want to be able to build my body back up so I can bulk up my intake without feeling bad about it because I’ll be working out. I know this thinking will end me with a different diagnosis so I’m concerned and looking on what to do. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

The issue is that sometimes after eating food I'm sensitive to I can bloat like crazy. In terms of water weight it can be up to 7kg / 15lbs within a short period of time. I am male and don't have estrogen cycles.   


So I've never understood how this is possible but somebody in a forum mentioned that empty fat cells remain in the body and they can in fact absorb water. Visually when this bloating happens it is mostly around the midsection, where the most loose skin/empty fat storage is located. So intuitively this makes sense.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if there is any science to this, or what to search for in terms of papers to learn more. Or if someone else has food intolerances + weight loss + massive bloating.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I posted this in the main edanonymous sub but figured I'd post here too....     
      
I've been thinking about this since replying to another post yesterday and I thought it would be worth trying to start a discussion. I'm not saying I'm an expert on this topic btw, though to be fair I fucking should be at this point, god knows I've got plenty of experience to draw on.     
       
Obviously this is a generalisation, but in my experience people with eating disorders tend to be more vulnerable in relationships, whether that's because of low self-worth, pre-existing trauma, dodgy health, etc. And let's be real, the type of people who are attracted to you when you're actively disordered tend not to be... the best.     
      
I'm 33 and I'm now in my first ever healthy relationship. Prior to this, I was *famously* bad at figuring out when a relationship was abusive. Like, I literally spent my teens and 20s legally classed as ""vulnerable to sexual exploitation"" because I was such an utter liability.     
      
As an example... after I broke up with my most recent ex, I very reluctantly spoke to the police because he was literally stalking me and sending me v disturbing material. They asked if the relationship had been abusive, and I was like ""Naaaaah... it wasn't healthy but I wouldn't say it was *abusive*!"" They asked more questions, turns out not only was it *definitely* abusive, they considered me at high risk of literally being murdered. I'd managed to convince myself that stuff like breaking my fingers and strangling me til I lost my voice and had black bruises around my neck, was no big deal and probably something I deserved. That stuff wasn't even the reason I broke up with him.     
      
This guy was super into me being younger than him, and very much encouraged my eating disorder - he wasn't overt about it, but he definitely knew what he was doing. Imo those things are both massive red flags. As it turns out, he ended up admitting to fantasising about my childhood abuse and apparently moved on to trying to find images of the abuse online (that's what he says at least, def could've just been looking for images in general). Obviously this is a bit of an extreme example, I guess my point is that normal, healthy, supportive partners do not encourage eating disorders. It's not normal for severely unwell people to be someone's ""type"". It just isn't.     
       
I also think, if someone is saying very triggering things about your body or if they encourage you to restrict/lose weight/whatever, knowing you have an eating disorder...  they most probably know what they're doing. It's not a ~lol boys are so dumb~ situation, or a case of someone being blunt or socially awkward. They know it hurts and for whatever reason they've decided to do it anyway. Doesn't automatically mean they're a predator, but at the very least it's a shitty thing to do.     
      
Idk. Is this something people have noticed or think about much? Do you guys think you've got what you need to figure out what sort of behaviour is or isn't ok?

Like I said, I'm definitely not an expert but I have a LOT of information on the topic lol.",t2_d6gkw24e,False,,0,False,Eating disorders and abusive relationships (TW for DV and SA),[],r/EdAnonymousAdults,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_w3s9e9,False,dark,0.94,,public,13,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1658338258.0,text,0,,,text,self.EdAnonymousAdults,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this in the main edanonymous sub but figured I&amp;#39;d post here too....     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this since replying to another post yesterday and I thought it would be worth trying to start a discussion. I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m an expert on this topic btw, though to be fair I fucking should be at this point, god knows I&amp;#39;ve got plenty of experience to draw on.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is a generalisation, but in my experience people with eating disorders tend to be more vulnerable in relationships, whether that&amp;#39;s because of low self-worth, pre-existing trauma, dodgy health, etc. And let&amp;#39;s be real, the type of people who are attracted to you when you&amp;#39;re actively disordered tend not to be... the best.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 33 and I&amp;#39;m now in my first ever healthy relationship. Prior to this, I was &lt;em&gt;famously&lt;/em&gt; bad at figuring out when a relationship was abusive. Like, I literally spent my teens and 20s legally classed as &amp;quot;vulnerable to sexual exploitation&amp;quot; because I was such an utter liability.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example... after I broke up with my most recent ex, I very reluctantly spoke to the police because he was literally stalking me and sending me v disturbing material. They asked if the relationship had been abusive, and I was like &amp;quot;Naaaaah... it wasn&amp;#39;t healthy but I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it was &lt;em&gt;abusive&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot; They asked more questions, turns out not only was it &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; abusive, they considered me at high risk of literally being murdered. I&amp;#39;d managed to convince myself that stuff like breaking my fingers and strangling me til I lost my voice and had black bruises around my neck, was no big deal and probably something I deserved. That stuff wasn&amp;#39;t even the reason I broke up with him.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy was super into me being younger than him, and very much encouraged my eating disorder - he wasn&amp;#39;t overt about it, but he definitely knew what he was doing. Imo those things are both massive red flags. As it turns out, he ended up admitting to fantasising about my childhood abuse and apparently moved on to trying to find images of the abuse online (that&amp;#39;s what he says at least, def could&amp;#39;ve just been looking for images in general). Obviously this is a bit of an extreme example, I guess my point is that normal, healthy, supportive partners do not encourage eating disorders. It&amp;#39;s not normal for severely unwell people to be someone&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;. It just isn&amp;#39;t.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think, if someone is saying very triggering things about your body or if they encourage you to restrict/lose weight/whatever, knowing you have an eating disorder...  they most probably know what they&amp;#39;re doing. It&amp;#39;s not a ~lol boys are so dumb~ situation, or a case of someone being blunt or socially awkward. They know it hurts and for whatever reason they&amp;#39;ve decided to do it anyway. Doesn&amp;#39;t automatically mean they&amp;#39;re a predator, but at the very least it&amp;#39;s a shitty thing to do.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk. Is this something people have noticed or think about much? Do you guys think you&amp;#39;ve got what you need to figure out what sort of behaviour is or isn&amp;#39;t ok? Do you know what steps you can take to protect yourself if you need to? Like I said, I&amp;#39;m definitely not an expert but I have a LOT of information on the topic lol.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I’ve been doing better. I’m bulimic, and really trying to recover to get my non-bloated body, my non-foggy brain, and my life back, but I’m still at the point where I regularly relapse.

About a week ago I had a breakdown and cried to my husband. He’s fully aware of my struggles and more often than not witnesses them.

“I will never get better.” I admitted to him. “You should just leave me. I’ve been saying I’ll eventually recover and be over it for so long now. I need to be honest with you. Genuinely, I don’t think I’ll ever truly recover.”

His response shocked me.

“I always knew that.”

It’s not that he doesn’t believe in me, support me, or want me to get better. I can tell that he does, more than anything. But he’s known all along that I’ve been lying to myself, and to him. To everyone. I’m that obvious. I’ll do better for a little while, excite myself with my tangible progress, finally start to feel okay, and inevitably relapse in a way that is messy, destructive, detrimental to not just my body but entire life, feel extremely disappointed in myself, and get back on the wheel, only for it to all happen again, exactly the same.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

I studied English and psychology in college. I know more than anyone how true the above is. And yet I’ve been guilty of it. I do the same thing, over and over, and still I’m shocked when nothing changes.

It was a weird relief hearing that. I didn’t have to change. I was accepted. I was, on some level, understood. The worst parts of me, the thing I hate most about myself, was just part of the package. It was okay.

I’ll do better for a little while, excite myself with my tangible progress, finally start to feel okay, and inevitably relapse in a way that is messy, destructive, detrimental to not just my body but entire life, feel extremely disappointed in myself, and get back on the wheel, only for it to all happen again, exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied English and psychology in college. I know more than anyone how true the above is. And yet I’ve been guilty of it. I do the same thing, over and over, and still I’m shocked when nothing changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a weird relief hearing that. I didn’t have to change. I was accepted. I was, on some level, understood. The worst parts of me, the thing I hate most about myself, was just part of the package. It was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purged one more time after that. The guilt I felt was immense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit purging that night.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I feel so…angry. Sad. And triggered.

This literally happens whenever I am around my ED mom. We have such a complicated relationship. I’m really not even sure anymore if you can call it a relationship. 

Yesterday we all went out and it was really nice spending time together as a family. But I’m starting to notice things now that I previously didn’t as I process all of my unresolved trauma. Last night I realized that my dad is also deeply affected by ED, and I’m not even sure he realizes it.

My mom’s ED affected us all. Me. My sisters. And my dad. No one was immune. We were out from 6pm until almost 10:30pm. My dad mentioned towards the end that he was hungry. He then said he hadn’t yet eaten that day. 

I was mad and surprised to hear this. My dad is 66. I asked why he didn’t eat before he left the house, knowing that we would be out late. I want him to take care of himself. He then said that he and my mom don’t usually eat until 8pm or so. I said, “why so late?” He just kind of shrugged. He then texted me after we all got back home and said he had a salad. A salad. That was all he ate all day. And my mom never cooked growing up, so everyone was left to fend for themselves. I recall my dad often snacking on Oreos and ice cream. None of us have ever had a healthy relationship with food.

We also had a family picnic last weekend and I brought ice cream sandwiches for everyone as I didn’t want to come empty handed. There were quite a few leftover and I left the box in my parent’s freezer. My dad finished them off, like multiple at a time, and last night he was shaming himself for it. He grabbed his gut and said he can’t lose it. It’s like my dad is stuck in a binge-restrict cycle and he doesn’t even realize it. It breaks my heart. 

My dad was also super fixated on getting in as much steps as possible last night. Everyone in our family wears stupid fitness trackers. My sisters (and now mom) are marathon runners. I am a long distance runner and even my dad has taken up long distance running in his later years. 

But he was absolutely obsessed with the steps last night. My dad and I were kind of joking around about getting our steps in. I didn’t really like it, but my dad kept pushing the issue wanting to know how many steps I was at. My dad doesn’t know I have relapsed, so he didn’t understand that what he was doing could potentially be triggering. My mom *does* know I relapsed though. She was the first one to notice. 

At the end of the outing, my dad asked how many I had and I told him. It was a high number. He was disappointed in himself as his number wasn’t as high. And he’s like, ‘you went for a run today, didn’t you?’ I said yes and then my mom said, “well I got (insert astronomical numbers of steps here).” And then she proceeded to say, “I get up at 5am every day and go for an hour swim, then go running for a few hours later on.” And then she goes swimming again. She does this every single day. 

I was seething with rage by this point. She KNOWS I relapsed. And I’m trying to understand how she claims she is concerned about me when she would *deliberately* trigger me like that. And she acted cold towards me all night last night, so I don’t believe she is clueless. My dad also got out of the car to hug me goodnight and my mom didn’t. She just said, “bye”. I know EDs can be competitive in nature, but still. It’s just really hard for me to believe anything other than that the only reason she wants to call me out on my relapse is because she views it as a competition between us both. 

And today I pushed myself even harder on my run. She’s in my head and I can’t get her out. 

I vented to my husband about everything this morning and he gently reminded me that she struggles with mental illness too. And that’s what ED is—a mental illness. But still. I’m tired of having empathy for her. I’m tired of being triggered every time I see my family. I’m just tired.

I just have so many emotions after last night. I feel sad knowing just how much ED has impacted my entire family. I hate that I have to realize and process all of this. It is exhausting. I feel for everyone—especially my dad now. I am struggling to feel anything other than hatred towards my mom right now. And maybe that is the ED part of me expressing that hatred, but it’s palpable.

&lt;p&gt;My mom’s ED affected us all. Me. My sisters. And my dad. No one was immune. We were out from 6pm until almost 10:30pm. My dad mentioned towards the end that he was hungry. He then said he hadn’t yet eaten that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mad and surprised to hear this. My dad is 66. I asked why he didn’t eat before he left the house, knowing that we would be out late. I want him to take care of himself. He then said that he and my mom don’t usually eat until 8pm or so. I said, “why so late?” He just kind of shrugged. He then texted me after we all got back home and said he had a salad. A salad. That was all he ate all day. And my mom never cooked growing up, so everyone was left to fend for themselves. I recall my dad often snacking on Oreos and ice cream. None of us have ever had a healthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a family picnic last weekend and I brought ice cream sandwiches for everyone as I didn’t want to come empty handed. There were quite a few leftover and I left the box in my parent’s freezer. My dad finished them off, like multiple at a time, and last night he was shaming himself for it. He grabbed his gut and said he can’t lose it. It’s like my dad is stuck in a binge-restrict cycle and he doesn’t even realize it. It breaks my heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad was also super fixated on getting in as much steps as possible last night. Everyone in our family wears stupid fitness trackers. My sisters (and now mom) are marathon runners. I am a long distance runner and even my dad has taken up long distance running in his later years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he was absolutely obsessed with the steps last night. My dad and I were kind of joking around about getting our steps in. I didn’t really like it, but my dad kept pushing the issue wanting to know how many steps I was at. My dad doesn’t know I have relapsed, so he didn’t understand that what he was doing could potentially be triggering. My mom &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; know I relapsed though. She was the first one to notice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the outing, my dad asked how many I had and I told him. It was a high number. He was disappointed in himself as his number wasn’t as high. And he’s like, ‘you went for a run today, didn’t you?’ I said yes and then my mom said, “well I got (insert astronomical numbers of steps here).” And then she proceeded to say, “I get up at 5am every day and go for an hour swim, then go running for a few hours later on.” And then she goes swimming again. She does this every single day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seething with rage by this point. She KNOWS I relapsed. And I’m trying to understand how she claims she is concerned about me when she would &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; trigger me like that. And she acted cold towards me all night last night, so I don’t believe she is clueless. My dad also got out of the car to hug me goodnight and my mom didn’t. She just said, “bye”. I know EDs can be competitive in nature, but still. It’s just really hard for me to believe anything other than that the only reason she wants to call me out on my relapse is because she views it as a competition between us both. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I pushed myself even harder on my run. She’s in my head and I can’t get her out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vented to my husband about everything this morning and he gently reminded me that she struggles with mental illness too. And that’s what ED is—a mental illness. But still. I’m tired of having empathy for her. I’m tired of being triggered every time I see my family. I’m just tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have so many emotions after last night. I feel sad knowing just how much ED has impacted my entire family. I hate that I have to realize and process all of this. It is exhausting. I feel for everyone—especially my dad now. I am struggling to feel anything other than hatred towards my mom right now. And maybe that is the ED part of me expressing that hatred, but it’s palpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for letting me vent.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I hate how on a daily basis I feel I found a balance between the ED and the ""real life"" (husband, work, hobbies, etc) but how much the lesser change ruins everything and reinforces the ED thoughts and behaviours. It's so frustrating and it always makes me as much angry and sad each time. So here are today's examples...

Tomorrow is a bank holiday where I live and bank holidays are so triggering because they are the perfect opportunity to binge eat: no obligation but time to eat and time to rest... Since I have one binge eating episode per week for a couple of years I try to stick to this schedule to deal with the bank holiday: I can only binge on weekends, no exception, as hard as it is. Anyway, my plan was not to binge, to follow the usual routine and all, so no food shopping or anything: I stick to my routine and there's usually no binge on Thursday, this is what I do since more than 2 years so I can do it this week.

So I was in this good mindset, repeating that I only have to do what I did during the last 110+ weeks, it's totally doable, everything gonna be fine, etc, and then bam!, we've been informed of a major change of the work hours and schedules because of the current heatwave. And of course, it immediately caused me some anxiety and, since binge eating is my coping mechanism, a massive urge to binge. I tried to breathe and stay rational, to calmly assimilate the informations and their impact, there's nothing complicated or grave, but the pulsion to stuff myself was so strong that as soon as I could take my lunch break I went to a supermarket to buy some sandwiches, pastries and donuts... Which is stupid and I hate in itself, but even more because it incidentally cancel all the previous efforts related to the bank holiday...

**\[TL;DR / conclusion\]** I hate how my anxiety and so BED make me unable to deal with unplanned things, even the littlest ones, how I need my routine to deal with life, and how the lesser change causes/amplifies some binge eating urges which can totally overwhelm me. I hate how each progress (limiting enough the ED to have a semblance or normal life) is so precarious and never acquired. I hate that my instinctive reaction to anything unusual, any strong emotion, any change, etc, is to gobble food.

I mean, be safe about it, but please, at least consider it.

Seriously, please.

My personal experience: The first time I tried magic mushrooms was in January of '21. I felt euphoric and noticed a lot of simple pleasures i had taken for granted before then which was cool. At one point, i was so warm i took off my shirt and was hanging in my apartment in a sports bra. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and for the first time in my life I truly loved myself, flaws and all. I loved my body genuinely in a way that i thought other people only faked for views and likes. I tried an apple and, for the first time, i saw food as nourishment and not just a necessary evil that my flesh prison demanded. After that i started eating whole fresh foods and cooking real recipes, working out, building strength, and loving my body. It completely changed my relationship with food, exercise, and my body. A year and a half later and i take them once every few weeks to few months as needed and have gone from a suicide attempt in 2018 to loving life in a way i never thought was possible. 

The last time I tried to run before my trip, i broke down crying after about a minute because I hated myself so much and vowed to never run again. I'm currently training to run a marathon.

My scientific background: I hold a MSc in Biomedicine from Tufts and wrote my masters thesis on psilocybin therapy. Some highlights include: 
- they are one of the safest, if not THE safest drug you could possibly try, including weed and alcohol
- there is no medically documented instances of hallucinogenic perception persisting disorder (sustained hallucinogenic symptoms after the initial trip) from psilocybin despite there being hundreds of documented administrations of the drug. That is, no permanent negative side effects. (There is, however, anecdotal evidence online of such instances)
- in treatment of depression, psilocybin showed efficacy in ~70% of patients compared to Lexapro's (SSRI) 30%
- similarly promising data exists for treatment resistant depression, eating disorders, and OCD
- administration of only a few doses (1-4) has been shown to yield sustained positive effects on mental health up to 6 months afterwards, meaning no need for daily medication and no sustained side effects (beyond the first 24 hours following administration)
- they also pose promise as treatment for PTSD, inflammation, anger issues, social issues, addiction to other substances (especially alcohol or opioids), and more

I'm happy to type up more info on how to explore this safely or to post my thesis if people are interested.

Edit to clarify some good points people keep making: Part of being safe with this is making sure that you are in a positive mindset when you take them and are ready to heal.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Just a rant. I've started an office job which means my physical hunger levels have absolutely tanked leading to me really struggling to not lose weight (I'm in treatment and will get kicked out/sent to hospital if I lose too much). At the same time, my mental hunger is the highest it's ever been due to boredom.

As a result I keep wanting to eat but not feeling hungry and it's the biggest recipe for guilt ever because it feels like if I eat according to my mental hunger/cravings I'm being greedy because I'm not physically hungry.

So am I really not going to lose my overshoot weight? A YEAR ago I was 20 pounds less than I am now (pre-ED). You’re seriously telling me I’m not gonna lose the weight? Everyone’s saying “you’re an adult now” like it’s been a YEARRRR. Adulthood weight gain does not happen just like that.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Cross posting this from r/EDanonymous.

I am a male student who for 9 months was unable to find work and lived off of a disturbingly low budget (did not really recognize how bad it was at the time). My weight plummeted because in order to pay for other things I had the mindset that I could just skip meals. 

I ended up moving and finding a part-time job and while I'm still struggling I am able to afford an appropriate amount of food and am sometimes getting food for free. I am budgeting properly and know how my money is being spent and how much I can still spend, but I am fearful of spending money and keep reverting back to eating less. It is true that not eating would give me more breathing room, but I am able to get by now without skipping meals.

I've told myself that I'll look better skinnier anyways and  that I don't want to gain back the weight but I honestly feel less healthy and weaker and want to be back to normal, but at the same time I am pretty accepting of where I'm at and don't fear getting worse, but I also do?

I try to snap myself out of this kind of thinking and just eat normally but I feel guilty if I spend money on food or go over [removed] calories. I don't bring food to work with me and I try to go to bed on an empty stomach. There are some days where I aim to eat as little as [removed] calories. I also feel really full and uncomfortably bloated if I try to eat my old normal now. I end up eating around 2000 calories on the odd day where I feel particularly weak.

I realized I might have an issue after eating around 2000 calories the past few days because I have felt so fatigued at work, and this resulted in me feeling too full and also very guilty and thinking about eating less again. 

One thing I did not mention in the original post is another fear of regaining the weight comes from the fact that I am no longer able to do strenuous activities like I did before because of an injury. I fear regaining the weight because I won't be able to put on as much muscle.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared. 

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I had stopped seeing her for almost three months due to my relapse and I told her yesterday that I could no longer in good conscience continue seeing her while deliberately hiding my relapse.

But it became too much. The weight was too heavy to carry on my own. But I didn’t want to burden anyone with it, especially because right now, I have no intention of recovering. I hid it from everyone. My husband finally said something after my mother reached out to him and he admitted he noticed how much weight I had lost and wasn’t sure how to approach the subject because we all know how complex EDs are. They have copious triggers, which must be approached very delicately. And I do know it’s exhausting for people to know what to say and how to say it.

My husband expressed his concern and he expressed concern on behalf of my mother. So I made an appointment with my therapist. No more secrets. Yesterday, I said to her, *WHY* is this all happening now? Like, all of these things from my past, why can’t I just get over it? Because outwardly, things in my life have never been better (and it’s true). So WHY can’t my stupid messed up mind catch up with me? 

And she said that’s exactly it. She said, “You have been through so much trauma and there are so many complex layers and you have just been moving through it. Surviving. You never had time to pause. But now you have stability in your life. You have a stable job after years of instability. You are in a stable relationship and now married after years of abuse and unloving partners. And even your relationship with your family is much better now. So now you have time to pause. You can start to digest.”

And she said that it is just too much for me to pause and allow the feelings to come up that have been building over decades and I just can’t allow myself to feel all of this pain and digest everything. So I fall back onto my ED as a means to cope. 

And it really shook me to my core. Like, it really does all make sense now. 

I am not ready to recover yet. And I know like any addict—because that’s what an eating disorder is—I have to be ready to recover, but I am at least grateful I confided in her. She is a safe space. I am at least grateful I don’t have to harbor this awful secret anymore and I have someone who is qualified to help me carry it.

So….


Went on holiday for my birthday last week with my friends, hated my body the whole time, felt gross in holiday clothes and it really hit me hard. 
It’s knocked me into relapse on restricting and I barely ate all week and had a massive B/P session when I came home. 
The day after we got back a friend messaged me a number for a new coke plug they got and I hit them straight up and bought a fair amount…like more than I can really afford. This was on the impulse it would stop me eating for a while. 

That was Monday….it’s now Thursday night I’ve had around 6 hours sleep since and I’ve cleared through most of it. Have eaten so little it’s insane even for me in restriction (won’t mention cals here). 

I’m glad not to have eaten but I’ve had non stop nose bleeds for the past 8 hours, got a banging headache and all I can think to do is keep getting high to help me ignore it and I’m scared I’ll stop and binge my face off.

The only times I can bring myself to eat more is if I&amp;#39;m high, so now I&amp;#39;m forming a cannabis habit just to try to get more food in me. Sometimes I&amp;#39;m hungry and the moment food is in front of me, my hunger disappears and I can&amp;#39;t eat. Or sometimes I&amp;#39;m starving and I&amp;#39;ll take a few bites, only to get &amp;quot;tired of eating&amp;quot; and stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find much help for disordered eating, everything is about eating disorders. Any advice as to what to do or where to find more help?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m sick and tired of alternating between anorexia and bulimia. I’ve gone from average/slightly overweight, developed my ED, brcame severely underweight, and “balanced” to “healthy weight” over the last year. I eat well and try not to think about it too much. But I inherently do.

Trying to eat “normally” is SO hard. I feel disgusting every time I do eat. It’s way easier being bulimic. It’s almost easier being anorexic, I just drink every night so those calories add up so much. But I’d rather be anorexic and skinny than “normal.” I think I’d just rather have an eating disorder. It gives me something to focus on, and I feel so much dopamine from achieving my weight or intake goals. 

I want to quit stimulants because they bloat me, and I’m tired of feeling like I can’t function if I suddenly run out of them prematurely for the month. I’ve finally fixed my hormone issues and can restrict for daaaays without stimulants. But stimulants make me eat healthy because they give me the dopamine necessary to eat “normally” and not KEEP EATING. And if I don’t take them, I either 1) binge or overeat constantly 2) do not eat at all. And it sucks. I wish I’d never taken adderall. Or coke. Or meth.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared. 

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

So many people asking what I do or what’s my “secret” (mental illness ha).

I'm in a discord server for people in my area and the people who are just a few years older than me are so much more mature. They go to bars, breweries, vineyards.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've found a really bad way of suppressing my appetite. I can't do coffee anymore due to gastritis, and can barely stay on tea because even the little bit of caffeine makes me really anxious and shaky and gives me bad stomach cramps.

I've found that if I take ibuprofen, I become too nauseous and tired to eat anything, and somedays I don't even think about food because of it. I lost a considerable amount of weight a couple of years ago, and it was because I had given myself an ulcer and couldn't keep anything down. It was extremely painful and I have no interest in experiencing that again. But I just couldn't ignore how much weight I lost in the process. I've developed a routine that has kept me with perpetual gastritis that physically stops me from eating most days, but I can keep the intense stomach pain down because I just take PPIs to counteract the ibuprofen. This routine has been going on since my early teens, and now I'm a young adult in university.

I really believed - for years - that I could just do this routine forever and keep the weight off/lose as much as I wanted whenever because I was taking the PPIs and, thus, I was safe. But I've recently become aware of how ibuprofen damages the kidneys, and it was only after some concerning symptoms began occurring that I looked over my medical records and noticed a downward trend in my eGFR. My PCP has not mentioned it to me, likely because I'm younger and people can have fluctuations in their eGFRs that are normal. I'm pretty sure mine is normal, as well. But I'm unhappy now that I know I can't continue this routine of mine if I want to have healthy and functioning kidneys when I hit middle-old age (if that's even still possible now).

I don't have faith that I can stop, though. I've habitually associated every piece of food with taking ibuprofen for an incredibly long time, and it's become like a punishment. My god, it's so incredibly toxic, but it works so well it's terrifying. I feel like I have the devil and angel on my shoulders because gastritis has been the perfect cover for people around me who are suspicious of the weight loss or vomiting; they know I've had ulcers and chronic gastritis and so they just think I'm one of those people who can't eat a whole lot. And no one is suspicious when I refuse food because ""no, no, I can't; my stomach is bothering me right now."" And yet, it's turned around to bite me in the ass because now there really are foods I can't have, such as coffee, which was a really great appetite suppressant for me, but I can't have it now for fear of the scorching hot lava it now produces in my stomach. The nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramping keep me from gaining weight, but it's so so painful; I love it but I hate it. It's completely changed my microbiome: one day I'll be cramping hard with constipation and the very next is all liquid. Every time I pee it's disgusting and foamy and I wish I could just go back to the coffee because at least it kept me regular.

I have been looking into some better ways of suppressing appetite, such as fiber supplements. And I think they could lead to enjoying a healthy meal more, which I've been striving towards. I've read that taking a fiber capsule before a meal slows digestion so you get full faster. I don't know. I'm leaning towards that right now as an alternative because I just don't see this routine being able to last much longer, or, rather, *me* being able to last *on* it much longer.

Earlier this week I delayed dinner while spinning plates, and was starting to stress about what to eat, then I remembered how disappointed I am with my body lately, and I remembered that I don't have to eat dinner...so I just had alcohol instead.

Then the next night I just made a small dinner because I didn't have the energy and didn't feel like I deserved anything more. And I remembered that I ate a cupcake at work.

I feel passive. I don't have the energy or self-assurance to lean in or to walk away. It feels like the day is going to decide for me when or what I eat, because I can't even decide. I just want to be a robot right now -- ignore the emotions and just do basic things other people need.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared.

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

I live with them and they know I don't eat and that's good to them.

I’m on the low end of normal. Not underweight. But I’m not done losing. I don’t want to be done losing. I relapsed two months ago and I guess people are starting to catch on, so now I’m annoyed. I want to continue my ED behaviors in peace. I know that’s the ED talking, but still. My mom—who also has an eating disorder—reached out to my husband yesterday expressing her concern and sent him a pic of me from a few months ago and a pic I just took the other day. 

My husband said he noticed too, but did not want to say anything out of fear of further triggering me. And then this morning I wake up to a text from my dad asking if I’m eating enough and how I need to eat more and that he’s worried, etc. He’s retired and always worried about the world. I just genuinely want him to enjoy his retirement and not worry about his mentally ill adult daughter. 

I offered to make a doctor’s appt to give my husband some peace of mind because I really don’t want him to worry about me which is why I have kept my relapse to myself. He asked me if I relapsed and I of course lied and said no, and promised I have it under control. Jesus. EDs really *do* feel like an addiction. I hate the lying. But I want to continue losing.

Hello I am 24(M) and looking for some advice because I really don’t know where else to go. I recently had a major mental breakdown after a year of over excersizing and under eating. I was counting calories and eating  a significantly low amount of calories for about six months and started to slowly increase my calories but I fear I was too late. After one year of under eating, intense weight lifting and working out for six days a week for two plus hours I started to have severe fatigue, anxiety and panic attacks and muscle pain.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Long post. I need to get my thoughts out and hear from anyone who can relate. Thank you to anyone who reads. 

I strongly believe that what ultimately led me to developing an eating disorder was my mother. My mother has an eating disorder. And I’m just now beginning to process it and it feels incredibly overwhelming. My relationship with my mother has always been so strained. So much trauma. The “mother wound” is real and I think it is largely because of her eating disorder. 

She couldn’t mother me or my sisters in the way we needed her to. My dad described her like another child to take care of, feeling like he had 5 daughters instead of 4. My mother has never been able to take care of herself. She only is able to work part time and she literally could not survive on her own.

Looking back on everything, it all makes sense now. Hindsight really is 20/20. I started putting the pieces together back in 2016 when I had relapsed. Little things she did, they started to make sense. And her health issues really started to explain so much. I actually asked her, “do you have an eating disorder?” I wanted to know. A part of me *needed* to know. I didn’t get an answer, but her unwillingness to answer was itself an answer.

She has always been small. In fact, I recall my sister and I discussing that from behind, when trying to find her at the grocery store, she could be mistaken for a child. At certain times, her voice will often match—childlike and innocent sounding even though she is nearing 65 years old. 

My sisters and I were always left to fend for ourselves when it came to meals. 

She never cooked. She still doesn’t. And she had our whole family’s normal as one meal per day. Something I still do decades later.

She was always “sick” and by sick I mean vomiting. She would always be in the bathroom. She would vomit regularly. Usually after meals, or late at night when she thought everyone else was sleeping. She still vomits regularly. And I think now it is because she has gastroparesis.

She struggled with low blood pressure and passing out when I was younger. I remember she actually had to carry a blood pressure monitor with her for a time.

She has thyroid issues and needs to take medication for it.

Every time we go out to eat, she takes approximately 3 bites and then always claims she is too full to continue.

She has brought her own salad dressing when we would go out to restaurants.

She has dealt with severe chronic constipation for years and relies heavily on laxatives for relief.

She hoards food and there would be SO much expired food that would need to be thrown out whenever I or my younger sister would visit.

She had a scare with her liver some years ago.

She has had issues with her bladder for as long as I can remember.

She is *always* freezing and needs to have a sweater with her at all times.

And now in her later years, she has taken up long distance running. The weird things still continue. The not eating more than 3 bites and asking for a box.

She was one of the first people to realize I had an eating disorder. And I think it’s because she knew what to look for. She knew the signs.

And part of me feels like she felt like she had to compete with me. And every time I start to look “too thin” for her liking, she will make it known. She has even reached out to my husband before, likely projecting. But still, she wasn’t wrong.

I have so many feelings that come up when it comes to our relationship.

She couldn’t be the mother I needed. The mother my sisters needed, too. And today, she still isn’t. She simply can’t.

But today, I am able to look past the hurt and hatred and see a woman who is also seriously wounded, that came from a traumatic background and likely used her eating disorder as a coping mechanism. Just like I have.

And the thing that terrifies me most is that I *am* becoming my mother and I try tooth and nail to fight it, but I can’t. The more I fight it, the more I realize I am acting just as she did. Just as she does. I am terrified for what this means for my future. I struggle to hold a job. I use my ED as a coping mechanism to in a sense, rebel against the responsibilities of adulthood. I just want to be a child because I *feel* like a child. I feel like I truly am not cut out for this world.

And I think that is how my mother felt. That is how my mother *still* feels.

And I can’t help but feel a profound sense of sadness in place of the anger and hurt I have felt towards her all of these years. Because I get it now. I understand her anguish because now it’s my anguish. 

And while part of me still feels hurt and angry, it wasn’t her fault. She was just traumatized and addicted, just like I am.

Mom, I forgive you.",t2_dh388orn,False,,0,False,I’m 30 years old and my biggest trigger is my mother and I hate that I am becoming her,[],r/EdAnonymousAdults,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_vdq69k,False,dark,0.97,,public,54,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,54,,False,False,self,1655398126.0,,[],{},,True,,1655397616.0,text,0,,,text,self.EdAnonymousAdults,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post. I need to get my thoughts out and hear from anyone who can relate. Thank you to anyone who reads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that what ultimately led me to developing an eating disorder was my mother. My mother has an eating disorder. And I’m just now beginning to process it and it feels incredibly overwhelming. My relationship with my mother has always been so strained. So much trauma. The “mother wound” is real and I think it is largely because of her eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She couldn’t mother me or my sisters in the way we needed her to. My dad described her like another child to take care of, feeling like he had 5 daughters instead of 4. My mother has never been able to take care of herself. She only is able to work part time and she literally could not survive on her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on everything, it all makes sense now. Hindsight really is 20/20. I started putting the pieces together back in 2016 when I had relapsed. Little things she did, they started to make sense. And her health issues really started to explain so much. I actually asked her, “do you have an eating disorder?” I wanted to know. A part of me &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to know. I didn’t get an answer, but her unwillingness to answer was itself an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has always been small. In fact, I recall my sister and I discussing that from behind, when trying to find her at the grocery store, she could be mistaken for a child. At certain times, her voice will often match—childlike and innocent sounding even though she is nearing 65 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sisters and I were always left to fend for ourselves when it came to meals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She never cooked. She still doesn’t. And she had our whole family’s normal as one meal per day. Something I still do decades later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was always “sick” and by sick I mean vomiting. She would always be in the bathroom. She would vomit regularly. Usually after meals, or late at night when she thought everyone else was sleeping. She still vomits regularly. And I think now it is because she has gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She struggled with low blood pressure and passing out when I was younger. I remember she actually had to carry a blood pressure monitor with her for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has thyroid issues and needs to take medication for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time we go out to eat, she takes approximately 3 bites and then always claims she is too full to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has brought her own salad dressing when we would go out to restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has dealt with severe chronic constipation for years and relies heavily on laxatives for relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hoards food and there would be SO much expired food that would need to be thrown out whenever I or my younger sister would visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had a scare with her liver some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has had issues with her bladder for as long as I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; freezing and needs to have a sweater with her at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now in her later years, she has taken up long distance running. The weird things still continue. The not eating more than 3 bites and asking for a box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was one of the first people to realize I had an eating disorder. And I think it’s because she knew what to look for. She knew the signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And part of me feels like she felt like she had to compete with me. And every time I start to look “too thin” for her liking, she will make it known. She has even reached out to my husband before, likely projecting. But still, she wasn’t wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so many feelings that come up when it comes to our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She couldn’t be the mother I needed. The mother my sisters needed, too. And today, she still isn’t. She simply can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, I am able to look past the hurt and hatred and see a woman who is also seriously wounded, that came from a traumatic background and likely used her eating disorder as a coping mechanism. Just like I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing that terrifies me most is that I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; becoming my mother and I try tooth and nail to fight it, but I can’t. The more I fight it, the more I realize I am acting just as she did. Just as she does. I am terrified for what this means for my future. I struggle to hold a job. I use my ED as a coping mechanism to in a sense, rebel against the responsibilities of adulthood. I just want to be a child because I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like a child. I feel like I truly am not cut out for this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that is how my mother felt. That is how my mother &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I can’t help but feel a profound sense of sadness in place of the anger and hurt I have felt towards her all of these years. Because I get it now. I understand her anguish because now it’s my anguish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while part of me still feels hurt and angry, it wasn’t her fault. She was just traumatized and addicted, just like I am.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I see a lot of posts like this so I apologize if it's repetitive, but I just have to say that I never thought that I'd start feeling apathetic about my ED. I mean, I still have a lot of rules and rigidity regarding food. I'm still terrified of being overweight, but not to the extent that I used to be. Like, if I'm going on a long walk with my family, I'll eat more than usual so that I don't feel like shit. In the past, I would never do that. Yeah, I feel guilty, but I just tell my ED voice to suck it. It's like my ED is an annoying pest that's never going to leave, so I've just decided to try to live with it in the least harmful way possible (AKA harm reduction). We both have our desires and we both stomp on each others quite often. 

At 22 years old and dealing with my ED since I was 13, I can't be bothered to listen to everything it says anymore. I'm gonna have that extra spoonful of PB because I want it,  gosh darn it. And I've done enough research—probably years of my life if I add it all up—researching stuff about nutrition. One spoonful of PB is not gonna kill me. Skipping a walk will not make me balloon up. No food is good or bad. The anxiety and guilt that I feel for eating to raise my low blood sugar or heal my pounding headache is unjustified. 

Another example is that I started birth control. In the past, I would only go on certain forms bc of fear of weight gain (which there is so much misinformation about online. do your own research and I'm sure y'all will be relieved!).

I’ve been eating 100-300 below maintenance off-and-on for a few months and I’ve lost a slooow gradual 5 lb since November. If I cut too low, my body absolutely cannot tolerate it.

Does anyone else feel like they just physically can’t tolerate a deficit? The days are generally fine, but I lay awake with no hope of falling asleep until I eat something.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been eating 100-300 below maintenance off-and-on for a few months and I’ve lost a slooow gradual 5 lb since November. If I cut too low, my body absolutely cannot tolerate it. Tried to go lower for LITERALLY ONE DAY and my muscles are aching and I can’t sleep and now I’m c/s-ing a plain slice of bread. I didn’t even restrict THAT much today, but I’m super active and my body freaks the fuck out when I’m in like a 500 cal deficit. Does anyone else feel like they just physically can’t tolerate a deficit? The days are generally fine, but I lay awake with no hope of falling asleep until I eat something. It triggers me when people who have never restricted can cut calories super low without repercussions…I feel like I’ve used up my body’s tolerance for restriction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just some insomnia thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

Idk exactly everything about her life - but we’ve shared some deep shit. Started texting but eventually now we just have Snapchat. 

I’m in a decent recovery phase for the last two years- and she’s looking much more alive than she was a few years ago so hopefully she’s doing some kind of recovery too. 

We don’t even talk about the Ed anymore even though like 2009-2014 we could always text each other how much we were struggling. I remember texting her to give me meanspo often during that time. I’m much taller than her so we would compare numbers and bmi to trigger each other.

&lt;p&gt;Idk exactly everything about her life - but we’ve shared some deep shit. Started texting but eventually now we just have Snapchat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in a decent recovery phase for the last two years- and she’s looking much more alive than she was a few years ago so hopefully she’s doing some kind of recovery too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t even talk about the Ed anymore even though like 2009-2014 we could always text each other how much we were struggling. I remember texting her to give me meanspo often during that time. I’m much taller than her so we would compare numbers and bmi to trigger each other. &lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"TW: mentions of weight gain/fluctuation (no numbers)

My SO bought me a FitBit for my birthday last summer, and I am religious about wearing it. However, last summer I was also diagnosed with long covid, and have been being treated for it ever since. After my first time catching covid, my symptoms were primarily GI issues. That in combination with being put on an elimination diet, and then getting the FitBit and exercising more, caused me to lose a fairly significant amount of weight rapidly, to the point where I was referred for IP treatment.

Fast forward to the Fall (I promise I'll get to my main point soon, brevity is not my strong suit!): I was on a waiting list for IP, and still sick from long covid. I ran out of leave time at my job and got fired. I was already super depressed before getting fired, because my symptoms rendered me pretty much housebound. I became even more sedentary, and gained back all the weight I had lost in about the same amount of time it took to lose it. Because of the weight gain, I was taken off the IP waiting list, which was super invalidating, but looking back I'm glad I didn't go to treatment.

Fast forward to a month ago: I caught covid a second time. A lot of my GI issues had gotten better by this point, and luckily they haven't flared up again yet. But this time around, I am struggling with PEM (post-exertion malaise), meaning that even a small amount of physical activity or socializing can wipe me out for days afterwards. I went running twice this week, and the day after that, I had chest and muscle pain, shortness of breath, couldn't get off the couch, and heavy brain fog.

Before I went running that first day, I noticed that my FitBit felt a little tight on my wrist...and realized that it no longer fits comfortably like it used to without adjusting the strap one notch. It is heartbreaking and humiliating. I'm not trying to become underweight again, but my body has deconditioned so much over the past year that I would like to start exercising again (also to help with depression). But if exercising means that I fuck myself over for days afterwards...what am I supposed to do? 

I'm sick of being sick. I'm sick of feeling fat and lazy. I'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but not being able to do anything about it.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I’ve struggled with an eating disorder for 10 years now. My abusive ex-partner acted as the catalyst. It was my way of coping with the abuse and his frequent comments about how perfect I would be if I “just lost 10 lbs” would be absorbed. I tried treatment in the past and failed because I couldn’t cope with having to gain weight—especially because I wasn’t even underweight at this point.

I did okay for a few years—definitely not recovered by any means, but I was restricting far less and I stopped my lax abuse, though I totally fucked my digestive system up because of my ED. But it would still creep in here and there—subtle. Refusing to eat at gatherings, incessant calorie counting, eating only one meal per day, etc.

It started rearing its ugly head again intensely once I convinced myself I had to look a certain way for my wedding and the all consuming thoughts resurfaced once again. Prior to that, I maintained a healthy weight and convinced myself it was okay. But the reality is I’m really only comfortable in a small body. 

I turned 30 recently and I believe that is what precipitated my relapse. I feel like a false adult so to speak. I suck at being an adult and I just want to get lost in my eating disorder. How society (mainly men) have always perpetuated the need for women to look a certain way really fucked my head up. I am seeing laugh lines and fine lines on my forehead and I just can’t cope. I am terrified of getting older. And I just overall feel like I’m generally failing at life. I’m using my ED as a crutch. I want to go back to that childlike sense of innocence that I frankly never was able to experience due to childhood trauma and a mother who also has an eating disorder, but I didn’t realize it until a few years ago when I finally started putting the pieces together.

I read an article that stated that one of the ‘seductions’ of anorexia is that it is an anesthetic and that’s exactly why I think I keep doing this. It makes me feel numb to life and it doesn’t leave room for fear and dark thoughts that inevitably creep in. But it doesn’t leave room for anything at all, really. My performance at my job is starting to be affected since my relapse. I’m afraid it is only a matter of time before my marriage is affected as well.

And how many nights I have gone to bed so early because I just can’t cope with the extreme hunger anymore.

But I am just so focused on getting physically smaller, that everything in my life is getting so much smaller as a result. I can’t stop and honestly, I don’t want to stop. I find a sort of comfort in this darkness because it is all I have ever known.

&lt;p&gt;it hit hard. I had to grab groceries after, and I couldn&amp;#39;t even get out of the car to buy food, let alone think about eating food, and gaining weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t go inpatient, but I can&amp;#39;t gain weight either.. :&amp;#39;(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me vent fam&lt;/p&gt;

The last few years I’ve been struggling with disordered eating but people close to me say that I’m fine. I feel lost and know I’m not healthy but not “sick” enough. 

I’m 27, 5’8, and weigh 97 pounds. I am shaky (glad I’m not a doctor because my hands shake horrendously), always cold, my nails break like crazy and I shed like a golden retriever. I know I am not fat and I don’t think I am. I’m nervous and anxious at the thought of gaining weight and looking visibly larger than I always have looked. I have always been underweight. Stress makes me not eat or gag when I put anything in my mouth. I also don’t feel hungry, and when my partner mentions that I only had a small amount of dinner it bothers me because I ate food and drink wine like normal people do. I visited a friend who was doing an inpatient stint and I weighed less than her and was freaked out. 

I’ve been to nutritionists, have had a colonoscopy and just saw my GP for a physical last week and when I mention my concerns they ask questions to determine if I am anorexic and every time nobody says anything or that according I the DSM I am not anorexic because I don’t meet the fixation on food or have body dysmorphia factors. 

My partner know I have some kind of disordered  eating and they think I’m not too sick. We have been talking about having a baby and it scares the fuck out of me. Not the parenting part, but looking pregnant. I would have to go off my meds and I don’t think I could mentally or emotionally deal with a baby belly and not snapping back to pre-baby body.

I also don’t want to starve a baby if I can get pregnant so I think it’s time to do something about the food thing.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've been in quasi-recovery since leaving treatment in February. I normally get &gt;!15000-25000!&lt; steps per day and eat something like &gt;!1600-1800!&lt; calories (I don't strictly count them). This worked for me, I was basically maintaining my weight or losing slowly. Lately the ED thoughts have taken over more and my intake was slipping a little. My dietician is not happy and wants me to consider HLOC. I'm not opposed to it or anything, but unfortunately my insurance does not cover it anymore. I went on a trip with my family this past weekend and ate somewhat less then usual because my strict routine was interrupted and was exercising less (though I still did &gt;!40k!&lt; steps over the course of the 3-day weekend). I get home and yesterday morning I found out I have fucking covid. I feel crappy. It's not the sickest I've ever been or anything, but my ED developed in the same time frame as the pandemic and so masks have protected me from having any bugs at all since pre-ED. I don't know how to handle this inability to exercise and still eat. I'm worried if I eat even &gt;!1200!&lt; calories I will gain weight. So I've been eating closer to &gt;!1000!&lt; which is the amount that put me in the hospital the first time (sustained over many months). I have my dietician appt on Zoom this afternoon and last time she just made me eat &gt;!600 calories!&lt; in session which... is not helpful. I'm worried my dietician will drop me and I'll spiral and wind up hospitalized again. I don't want to spiral back down to where I was but I'm just so terrified of weight gain. I really can't tolerate even my ""100% IBW"" let alone my actual set point which is a bit higher (since I developed my ED well into adulthood I have a good idea what it is). I'm worried if I try to exercise while I have covid or in the immediate post-covid period I'll increase my chances of getting long covid and not be able to exercise at all. I'm worried restricting will also hamper my body's ability to fight off the infection. I asked my doctor for a prescription for Paxlovid but apparently it interacts with my meds so I can't have it. I'm also really worried that I'll lose my sense of taste and/or smell permanently. So far it's muted/feels far away but I still have it. Even this being permanent would be devastating. The food I allow myself is one of the few pleasures I have in life. My life is shitty and I use my ED to cope with that.  I really want to sleep but I can only sleep on my stomach and my congestion is too uncomfortable in that position. I've only gotten a couple hours of fitful sleep on my back/side. Has anyone else here survived COVID with an ED and have any insight or ideas of how to cope? So far I'm just trying to stay busy with the still activities that I might not normally allow myself to do for as long like playing video games but I don't really have the energy to do it all day.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I'm a 33 year old man with a chronic restrictive ED (diagnosed with AN but imo it's more like a combo of ARFID and trauma bullshit). I've been in and out of treatment for the past 15 years or so and I'm now on a SEED treatment pathway which means expectations are pretty low.      
      
My intake/weight/health has improved a lot following a pretty bad relapse and I'm noticeably looking a lot better (bmi up from &gt;!just under 15!&lt; to &gt;!just under 17.5!&lt;, which is the target I'm generally supposed to aim for). Some of the weight loss was dehydration so it's less of a big deal than it sounds, I was definitely a bit ropey though and I'm now about as healthy as I ever really get.     
      
It's definitely a good thing because I felt like shit and if I'd continued going downhill I'd have ended up in hospital which is obviously the absolute last thing I want.

Rationally, I get that the reason it's noticeable is because I looked like a dead thing before and now I look sort of alright, when people tell me how healthy and ~glowing~ I am they mean it relatively. For some reason it still really gets to me though and looking like a dead thing feels way more comfortable. My boyfriend thinks I'm the fittest person alive (bless him) and on one hand that's clearly a good thing, but on the other hand it's like.... nooooo don't look at me...

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I’m 25 now. I feel like my ED started in a strange way. I was always a string bean growing up, but I was starting to progress like a normal child until high school when I was put on Focalin 2x daily for ADHD. Food was repulsive to me, I didn’t eat breakfast or lunch for 4 whole years of school. After school I would go ride and train horses on an empty stomach with 0 desire for food. Then when I got home in the evening I would binge on random shit in the fridge (bushels of strawberries, salami, bowls of cereal). I weighed probably 85-90 lbs at 5’6” throughout highschool. 

Looking back on it I feel like nobody cared or noticed. People always commented on me being “skin and bones” but it felt like they were complimenting me. When I went off to college, I decided to go off the meds for multiple reasons. My appetite was back, and I was still an athlete (competitive horseback riding/eventing), I didn’t even seem to care what my body looked like. I didn’t care what I looked like at all. I ate normally and was content. I was oblivious. 

Then, I had a series of massive knockout 
concussions from riding accidents while competing at school. I had received many over the years, but has 3 in one year while training a specific horse (this would be 7 total in my life) and was basically forced by doctors to stop riding. I was told I could die immediately if I hit my head again. 

So there went my sense of self, my identity, and my exercise. I started partying more, drinking more, I became very depressed and gained weight. My highest was 120 lbs, which isn’t even heavy, but it was more than I had ever had on my body. I ended up in the hospital for an attempt on my life and remember looking at myself in the mirror and thinking HOLY FUCK you are fat. I just hated myself and wanted to crawl back into my emaciated body from highschool. 

I was down to 98 lbs in Junior and Senior year of college. They were the best years in recent memory in terms of friendships, accomplishments, etc. I was “happy” when I look back on it, but also consumes by this dark obsession with restricting, being hungry, and being validated for my weight. I was constantly being complimented for my weight, it was sickening but I loved it. I still thought I was fat somehow. I would obsess over my thigh gap, my waist to hip ratio, I would measure my body with a measuring tape daily….this continued until the pandemic, when I was 23. 

Somehow my mindset changed, I think I was just burned out. I moved to another state, I got engaged, I was happy. I was eating normally. There was still a nagging voice in my head to weigh myself daily but I never did. Until I went to a Dr’s appt in late 2021 and realized I was 111 lbs. The horror. And now, I’m consumed again. I have control again. I feel like I will kill to be back where I was in college. I hate this. Why is this my life. 

However, it’s hard on my body now. I get shaky, I get extreme stomach pain when I don’t eat all day. I pass out and none of this ever used to happen to me.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I’ve had an unusual spike in life stress recently and feel like I never have a safe controlled space to eat as I wish. Basically eating enough to maintain my underweight weight, but usually I have time alone where I’ll eat foods that actually satisfy me and calm down the extreme hunger that I otherwise have. Eating such foods is not compatible with any normal socially accepted meal or meal time.

Ok, I’ll come out and say it because this is getting too vague. I’m eating “normal” because I need to survive and prevent severe binge urges. Eating normal is probably under eating a little because normal feels like too much. Anyway, I’m so fucking hungry and all I want is graham crackers with peanut butter and Nutella. Or some Greek yogurt and Cheerios. These hit the mental and physical needs I feel.

But then I think, will that really satisfy me or cause a new problem? Recent life change means I’m literally never alone. If I decide to “indulge” in these safe foods that would get my body to stop screaming for calorie dense foods, There’s a chance I’ll regret it and have no subtle way to purge. So apparently tonight I have dealt with this by thinking of these foods for hours, debating if I should just go for it, then thinking maybe I should hide the foods so I can eat them secretly when/if the time presents itself. All this back and forth led me to just putting myself to bed to make the decision moot. And now I’m thinking about how maybe I could sneak food in the middle of the night, but i don’t want to take the risk of having to explain to someone what I’m doing. 

I hate the secrecy of this disorder. I hate that so many boxes have to be checked to have a satisfying and safe eating experience. It makes me want to either go overboard or do nothing. I have never regretting not eating something in this kind of situation so I guess that is my decision tonight.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've been in the ER twice this week, and the second time they caught an arrhythmia on my EKG and put me on a heart monitor. I've been consistently having my worries around eating dismissed as just being GERD. I specifically told one doctor that I was concerned about the possibility of an eating disorder, she said I needed my GI issues treated first, and recommended that I get a scale to try to maintain my weight. I finally just sent my psychiatrist a message about what's going on. Now I have an appointment scheduled every other week. I feel bad for not saying anything sooner, but I also felt like I should just be patient and wait for my next appointment.

But after treatment and being forced to gain tons of weight, developing binge eating and other Ed triggered hypothyroidism and hashimotos in my system. Then when I finally made my way back around to restricting and starving as an adult a few years ago, the metabolic damage had been done and now no matter what I do, I can’t seem to lose weight. In order to lose even a few lbs I have to go to EXTREME measures. Barely eating, working out, no carbs, etc etc.   its like CICO DOESNT APPLY. Because if it did, I would be extremely underweight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s like the older we get, the harder it is to actually lose weight. Or maybe I’m just the lucky one with no metabolism and the inability to lose fat regardless of how much I starve . This is why I don’t even care about recovery anymore. What’s the point of recovering? Just to gain tons of weight and be miserable? No thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Yesterday,  for the 3rd time, my family doctor talked to me as though she were trying to convince me that I need help. ""We need to refer you to an ED clinic"" she said, and we once again filled out the same form we always fill out. Each time I seem to tick off *yes* to more and more behaviours. She put in my height as 2 cm shorter than I  actually am because I have terrible posture (which, though minuscule, I  am freaking out about because that will make my BMI seem higher, and it  is already ""normal"") and said my current weight aloud (which I didn't  know because my partner hid my scale). She took my blood pressure and it  was extremely high (just as I had told her months ago) and she said it  didn't make sense if I was starving myself (which I guess I'm not). She  told me it would be a long wait to hear back from the clinic (just as she had said 5 and 9 months ago when she never submitted the referral) but in the meantime, I have to rent a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. I feel like a failure because my BP is so damn high when it should be low if anything. She said I may have osteoporosis at this point and may not be able to have kids.

Last week, I  called the ED clinic myself and the line was disconnected. I called the  crisis line, and they HUNG UP on me when I was transferred! Aside from  that, I'm 2 years too old for most of the programs and groups in my  area, which are only provided for those aged up to 24. I got ahold of  the mental health outpatient near me and they said that there had never  been referrals to any services as I had thought, but they offered me a  CBT group that I will participate in.

I  feel that I have done a lot of reaching out, and yet I am in a worse  place than I was before. My doctor seemed to be comforted by the fact  that I had a therapist, but that was $100CAD for one online session a  week. I ran out of money, and I had no one to hold me accountable or to  support me in times of crisis. I didn't know what to do when extreme  hunger took hold or when I started to put on weight. My therapist said it was important that I see a dietitian, but how could I afford that?

On top of this, I also have a physical condition that requires me to wear an appliance, and as my body changes shape the appliance does not fit so  I have to repeatedly visit the nurse to be re-fitted only to change  shape again. Because I have had bowel surgery, I have a complication that causes me to get frequent bowel obstructions where I have to stop eating or switch to only fluids, and it is often triggered by eating  large amounts of food. The appearance of my stomach itself is very different than women my age because of surgical scarring as well.

In trying to recover with what little support I have, I feel that I have traded anorexia for np-bulimia and I am so angry at myself. I feel like this will never end. I don't know how to be taken seriously. I know this is not uncommon (spare the physical condition).

The reality, of our helplessness.  Our lack of understanding. Our limits. That we will get angry. We will lose patience. We will think horrible thoughts about the one we love.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"hi, i was wondering if anyone had any advice for travelling when in recovery. I'm going away in a month for 2 weeks with my boyfriend, and I will be weight restored just before I go away if I continue to hit weight targets each week (which I have done so far). Obviously being weight restored brings up a ton of ED crap, and I know the obvious is ""eat what you want"" etc etc, but realistically it's not practical for me quite like that - I also have Coeliac disease, which went abroad is a nightmare because of cross-contamination (aka I have to know where we are going before eating, have very very limited choices, which sometimes means the chef is just making stuff up).

My boyfriend is aware of my anorexia, and really helpful, but I am just terrified of weight gain - I won't be able to weigh myself at all whilst abroad (I normally do weekly weigh-ins, which will continue until I've maintained my weight for long enough), and obviously there is the standard diet culture shit about how much weight holiday (vacation - I'm in the UK) causes people to gain, etc etc, because of all the eating out. This is all so terrifying to me and I'm currently having multiple breakdowns a day even though this is in a months time.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I maintain my weight when on holiday? Is this even possible - I can't find any literature which speaks of it, it is all about weight gain, and I will only just have been weight restored (yes - I know it is normal to overshoot, if I go home and weigh myself and its overshot, I will be at quite high risk of relapse - it is safer for me to maintain - all it would do is prove everything my head is telling me). Also this will be the highest weight I have ever been - I was a naturally slim teenager until I got sick and now I am an adult.

Hey all. 

Exactly what it says in the title. I, a 33year old person, am afraid I'm relapsing.  I don't know what's triggering me as of late, but I'm having such a hard time with food.  For example, I've found a brand of oatmeal that I'll eat for breakfast, but that's the only thing I can eat. The store and I have been out for a week now, and I haven't had breakfast since I ran out. I plan to order it online on payday. 

Or today, husband ordered us Wendy's for lunch and I almost purged it. I relapsed last year and am afraid I'm doing it again. 

I feel so out of control of my actions and my body, I just don't know what to do, or how to bring this up to anyone I know. I have therapy in a few days but the therapist and I are just starting to get to know eachother. I've only mentioned I've had issues with disordered eating in the past, but I haven't actually went into details.

So even if I’m having a “fuck anorexia” moment and take the initiative to up my intake, nothing I have stocked looks appealing to me.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've been trying to explain how much extra difficulty I have been having with eating, more than my usual very difficult time from chronic GI problems, and I'm not getting the message across at all. A few people have recognized that I'm having anxiety issues around food, but seem to only connect it back to my health problems. I have found eating to be painful for a long time now, and I do have anxiety around it, but it's turned into more than that. A doctor suggested supplementing with ensure and still didn't get it when I said that I really didn't want to. I know I need to be more direct, but it's very difficult for me because of anxiety. I really am trying though, and they don't seem to notice anything beyond my physical illnesses. One of the only times I'm not having my mental health questioned for a chronic illnesses, and of course it's when I would benefit from those questions the most.

I'm having a very difficult time with concentration and I have a final exam tomorrow. I see my PCM on the 13th, and my husband is supposed to go with me to help, but that doesn't help me before my test. I've dropped 5% in less than a month, and more before then.

I'm at that sweet spot between getting back up and staying down. I want to go back up, but I don't. 

Recovery is hard, everyone knows. But I don't think that people who doesn't go through it can comprehend or even imagine what you need to face. 

Have you ever heard the soundwaves a black hole emits? Oblivion. 

The thing is, that same sound has been playing in my head for so long, I'm finding comfort in it. 

The boundless void inside my chest. 
The fire's warm embrace of the hell in my mind.
The crackling sound of my will to fight slipping through my finger, burning away.
The crackling sound of a cigarette being smoked on a quiet summer night. 

I was alone in the cold, dark night. I saw what I thought was a light, but it was that flame. That tiny, frail, dark flame I knew was still burning. 

Have you ever tried to put out an oil fire by throwing water on it? 

Now I'm home, wrapped within her tiny iron clasps, burning my skin against her claws as I'm trying to get a grip, or maybe to get them deeper into me. 

Because I don't know who I am without her. 

How easier would it be to just fall deeply into her sick and twisted fantasy.

Found this two nights ago. Wasn’t snooping. He struggles with his body image too and has never made me feel anything but great about myself and body at any weight. But still.

Barely ate yesterday, binged and purged last night, didn’t eat today, passed out at work, finally ate some cheese and crackers.

Led me to an important realization though.

I’ve always been a very black-and-white person. I’ve never been able to have more than one priority at a time. My eating disorder has been no different. Minus a brief period of time where I was doing well with “recovery,” my eating disorder has been my priority for the last 3 years. I can only care about other things in my life (jobs, relationships, etc) if they are actively falling apart, and then I’m doing damage control. Then they either fall apart (I quit the job, end the relationship, etc) or I fix them up enough to start neglecting them again. My eating disorder is my most serious relationship, my long-term career. It’s why everything in my life is always so turbulent.

Yes, I want to be skinny. Yes, I want to look like the porn girls. But I’m going to lose my whole life to it. The “control” of it is an illusion. I can control my body with it, but I’ve lost control of my life.

In high school, I had full blown anorexia. I had a million rules, constantly thought about food, thought my body looked like a space alien, etc etc. Just classic ana bullshit. Now that I’m an adult (I’m 25), it feels…different somehow.

For context, after years of binge eating disorder, I was in the ""Class 2 Obesity"" category of BMI.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Mostly weight related but not exclusively. So I had an appointment to dye my hair today and I knew what I wanted but recently I was going through old selfies trying to see what colors looked best on me. I used to dye my hair a lot before 2020 and then just stopped. But looking at all my old selfies I just kept noticing a more defined jaw and it messed me up. But I almost always use snapchat filters so it's hard to tell what I ever even look like. I don't know what my face looks like. 

After the appointment I took some selfies and even with the most minimal filters that improved my face overall, I felt like I still looked chubby like no definition in the jaw. So then I got all in my head like 'well I guess my face DID used to look better and shine through the filters' or whatever. 

I'm always paranoid I'm carrying my weight gain in my face. I might be. I don't know. Aside from today I barely take selfies anymore. I was looking forward to this hair appointment and these past few days have been recurring thoughts of 'what am I doing this for / I have to stop eating / it won't even look good because my face is too round' and I hate it. Even during the appointment I just kept thinking about how I have to fix my diet and my body. 

Didn't even clarify but I gained some 'covid weight' and I know it's not even that much but I feel like it makes me look so different, healthy eating choices don't change anything, and I hate it.

But I almost always use snapchat filters so it&amp;#39;s hard to tell what I ever even look like. I don&amp;#39;t know what my face looks like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the appointment I took some selfies and even with the most minimal filters that improved my face overall, I felt like I still looked chubby like no definition in the jaw. So then I got all in my head like &amp;#39;well I guess my face DID used to look better and shine through the filters&amp;#39; or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m always paranoid I&amp;#39;m carrying my weight gain in my face. I might be. I don&amp;#39;t know. Aside from today I barely take selfies anymore. I was looking forward to this hair appointment and these past few days have been recurring thoughts of &amp;#39;what am I doing this for / I have to stop eating / it won&amp;#39;t even look good because my face is too round&amp;#39; and I hate it. Even during the appointment I just kept thinking about how I have to fix my diet and my body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t even clarify but I gained some &amp;#39;covid weight&amp;#39; and I know it&amp;#39;s not even that much but I feel like it makes me look so different, healthy eating choices don&amp;#39;t change anything, and I hate it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to pick up bubble tea or donuts on the way home for me and my boyfriend but instead I just went home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m okay overall but just wanted to vent this out.&lt;/p&gt;

The obsession with losing fat, getting “shredded”, going full blown keto etc etc. not having much of an appetite and consuming hundreds of hours of content about fasting, keto, PSMF. This woman that I found on YouTube &amp; podcasts basically looks like the epitome of an anorexic woman. But she’s made it socially acceptable because she sells it as keto and PSMF. She’s super famous and writes cook books and has lost more than 90 lbs. she’s underweight, has like zero body fat. She literally looks like the epitome of a severe anorexic over exerciser.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've had an ED most of my teenage and adult years, and when I was 18-20 I restricted and got to a point where I was happy with my body's appearance for the first time in my life.

Anyway, back then I was fuelled by the depression and self-loathing brought on by unloving parents. It was easy as fuck to restrict. I didn't even get hungry most of the time. I purely used the power of self hatred.

But then... I met someone. For the first time ever I was loved unconditionally. And I started to eat properly.

I've been with him for years and we are now married. I've done so much mental work and my self hatred is essentially gone. I feel loved and appreciated by family, friends and colleagues. 

But over lockdown my BED came back and as a result I am currently the heaviest I've ever been. And while I don't HATE myself, I think I look fucking gross, I feel uncomfortable in my clothes, I want to hide away some days, and I avoid mirrors. So I've recently started weightlifting, cycling more, and eating a healthier diet and trying to control my binge urges.

You know. Trying to lose weight in a 'normal' way.

But then... I see a candid photo of myself or I feel particularly full or bloated and the urge to restrict/fast comes back. But then is immediately countered by the thought that I don't have to restrict, everyone loves me for who I am regardless, being my size is actually not the end of the world as I'm still fit and healthy ect. I don't want to miss out on nutrient-rich enjoyable foods.

Ugh. So essentially the past few years of 'recovery' and finding people who love me regardless has RUINED my ability to do ED behaviours.

But the ED urge to be Skinni™️ hasn't gone away.

I've been feeling shitty about this for the past 12 months tbh. The fact that I can't do my ED 'properly' as I did as a teen, coupled with the natural body changes of becoming an adult.

Can anyone relate? I'd really like some sympathy and understanding 💕

EDIT: I just said all this to my husband and had a cry while he cuddled me. And he responded that he knows it must be so hard, he sees me struggling, but he's really proud of me because my rationality shows that I am getting a better relationship with food. Yes, it will take time, but the ED voice will keep on getting quieter in my head. And although it might not feel great to be heavy right now, maybe that's what it took to figure out how to have a better food relationship.

So I want to echo that sentiment to all of you. I'm proud of you, because if you're in this same position it means you are letting go of your ED thoughts.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"On edtreatmentreviews I gave an honest review of my experience at a inpatient/residential center. My experience was bad and I wrote why. I accidentally left my initials on the review and someone I was with in treatment saw it. They put that the program wasn’t good for me because I was “obviously mentally unstable” and that I “always wanted to play the victim. But I was emotionally abused by the head psychiatrist there by her saying my anxiety attacks were for attention, and that I didn’t deserve to be inpatient.

Even when I’m eating enough, then I obsess about whether I’m eating too much, and drive myself crazy with WHY I’m not hungry, not thinking about food, this probably is just rambling that doesn’t make sense.

Restricting= obsession over food by glorifying it, putting it on a pedestal and like food is a forbidden treasure

Eating adequately= less obsessed about food but somehow disappointed that the obsession is gone

B and/or P = deeply dissatisfying way of indulging the obsession with food

Basically I’m constantly disappointed that manipulating my food intake in one way or another will not improve the crippling dissatisfaction with myself. 

Everyone says that “you’re more than your eating disorder and when you pet your ED go, you can embrace your true self.” Well, I hate my true self to the core so what’s the frickin point. 

I sometimes wish I had some other vice. I know that no one is perfect and everyone has some maladaptive way of coping. But you can’t get away from the fact that you need food to function and I’m always doing it in some dysfunctional way. 

I guess that by clinging to my ED I’m distancing myself from the self hatred and feelings of worthlessness. It’s a familiar but painful distraction. I’m so tired of fighting but I also know the terrible cycles I can fall into if I just give up. Harm reduction is the best I can do. But also would love to drop to a scarily low BMI just for funsies.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Hi, first time posting here. :) 

I'm in my late twenties and I sometimes feel like everyone in my life is doing better than me. They're getting married, having kids, and working jobs they actually like. 

And then there's me. I won't go into too much detail, but trust me - there's not a lot to write home about. Never has been, and I fear there never will be. 

I don't even want to get married or have kids right now, but the feeling of not being up to scratch is beyond depressing. I've had more than a few snarky retorts from people, even family members, about finding the 'one' and settling down. Nothing I'm trying to do right now seems to matter to these people. All that matters to them is that I'm not abiding by their timefame. 

Sometimes I like I'm playing catch up in my own life, and I'm never going to get anywhere. Sometimes I feel like I've got nothing to prove to anyone. But it can change nauseatingly fast and I'm sick of it. 

The only thing I feel remotely proud about right now is eating less and less while I try to make the dial on the scales go down. I'll check my weight multiple times a day trying to chase that high, because even if I feel like an absolute failure - I can at least be a skinnier failure.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"TW: self hate, feeling fat, suicidal ideation, periods, clothes, cars being buttheads.


So...heaviest day of period, first of all, good start. Feeling quite uncomfortable anyways.

Made a slightly snarky comment reply to someone's post on my main account because they were just shilling their own crappy subreddit (which was weird as hell anyway) instead of following sub rules, and someone else came back calling me names, so obviously that made me just delete my comment and move on with my life like a normal human being...and then ugly cry for an hour.

Started getting stuck on all the sad thoughts in the world so I thought I'd go for a walk, get some sunlight and fresh air, I needed to get out of that mindset. I wore a ""new"" top I'd modified - it's an old top, I just changed some things about, plus comfy jeans, comfy jacket. Felt OK in these clothes.

Saw my reflection quite a lot walking to the shops. Suddenly not fine, but whatever right, I have shops to visit, it'll be fine...

Every single pair of jeans I tried on was awful. Just straight up awful. Nothing looked right on me. Nothing fit. Either too big in the wrong places (because I deliberately picked up sizes two or three times too big/that was all they had...so I couldn't even feel good about that), or way, way too tight, even ones in my size. Or just weird shapes/weirdly cut. Just...I wanted some basic sodding jeans.

So I felt crap. Whatever. I was gonna have lunch, maybe a sandwich, but changed my mind and had coffee instead. Didn't even treat myself to a cigarette because I felt like the worst piece of shit at this point and didn't deserve a treat.

Nearly get hit by a car on the way back. I was following the people ahead of me at the crossing like the mindless dolt I apparently am, but I guess the light wasn't green, and a car came round the corner. I stepped back and would've been fine but the bastard driver honked at me and it freaked me out so bad I fell over on my arse. I scraped my elbow, twisted my ankle and donked my legs on the concrete, but didn't feel that til later. Don't fucking honk at pedestrians...I was out of the way by that point anyway. So obviously I then cried all the way into Tesco and all the way home. I felt like if I wasn't the fat gross one at the back of the pack of people, I'd have made it across the crossing before any car showed up. If I hadn't been so fat, I wouldn't have fallen over. If I hadn't been so fat, I'd be more hurt from falling over because my giant butt wouldn't have padded my fall and I'd be injured ""properly"" (I mean...never mind the fact that I'm actually in some pain. That pain is just because my fat body is so fat that it got injured by falling a couple of feet. Hey, who said I'm rational right now...).

A very nice lady saw the whole thing and asked if I wanted to sit with her and slagged off the car driver for honking instead of just braking (or just keeping on driving...since I wasn't in the way...) but I just politely declined because I'm too shit to deserve compassion.

And my chest hurts for no fucking reason (on the right hand side, in the boob area, so probably period related) and I hate it.

I wish the stupid car had crushed me but I'd probably do more damage to it with my awful body anyway. I know this is stupid and irrational. I know my mind's catastrophising and black-and-whiting everything, I know it's not reasonable, etc.

I just feel super crap today and I wanna just go to sleep but I can't because I had coffee for lunch and a fucking White Monster as an afternoon snack because I have to have dinner with my bf later and pretend that all is well today.

I stepped back and would&amp;#39;ve been fine but the bastard driver honked at me and it freaked me out so bad I fell over on my arse. I scraped my elbow, twisted my ankle and donked my legs on the concrete, but didn&amp;#39;t feel that til later. Don&amp;#39;t fucking honk at pedestrians...I was out of the way by that point anyway. So obviously I then cried all the way into Tesco and all the way home. I felt like if I wasn&amp;#39;t the fat gross one at the back of the pack of people, I&amp;#39;d have made it across the crossing before any car showed up. If I hadn&amp;#39;t been so fat, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have fallen over. If I hadn&amp;#39;t been so fat, I&amp;#39;d be more hurt from falling over because my giant butt wouldn&amp;#39;t have padded my fall and I&amp;#39;d be injured &amp;quot;properly&amp;quot; (I mean...never mind the fact that I&amp;#39;m actually in some pain. That pain is just because my fat body is so fat that it got injured by falling a couple of feet. Hey, who said I&amp;#39;m rational right now...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very nice lady saw the whole thing and asked if I wanted to sit with her and slagged off the car driver for honking instead of just braking (or just keeping on driving...since I wasn&amp;#39;t in the way...) but I just politely declined because I&amp;#39;m too shit to deserve compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my chest hurts for no fucking reason (on the right hand side, in the boob area, so probably period related) and I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish the stupid car had crushed me but I&amp;#39;d probably do more damage to it with my awful body anyway. I know this is stupid and irrational. I know my mind&amp;#39;s catastrophising and black-and-whiting everything, I know it&amp;#39;s not reasonable, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel super crap today and I wanna just go to sleep but I can&amp;#39;t because I had coffee for lunch and a fucking White Monster as an afternoon snack because I have to have dinner with my bf later and pretend that all is well today. I&amp;#39;m so tired and it&amp;#39;s all really dumb and it&amp;#39;s probably more amusing than anything else but I just wish I was back at my worst so I could dissociate and remove myself from this mess a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

When I worked at the shelter I was open about my ED, thinking since I'm actively recovering keeping myself accountable through them would help me. It actually did help a lot. I made a lot of friends there and looked forward to eating with my coworkers, which was huge!
I have a much better relationship with food now compared to then, although I still get brain fog if I have a  late lunch. Now that I'm thinking clearly I can remember all the times I was in a daze at a grocery store thinking I was just overworked or tired. That may have contributed, but I think it's more to do with my lack of nourishment.
I know I'm going to keep having these revelations for years, and one day I might look back and think about how far I've come. I'm honestly scared to think of what permanent damage I might have caused myself now that I know I want to stick around past 30.

I have a much better relationship with food now compared to then, although I still get brain fog if I have a  late lunch. Now that I&amp;#39;m thinking clearly I can remember all the times I was in a daze at a grocery store thinking I was just overworked or tired. That may have contributed, but I think it&amp;#39;s more to do with my lack of nourishment.
I know I&amp;#39;m going to keep having these revelations for years, and one day I might look back and think about how far I&amp;#39;ve come. I&amp;#39;m honestly scared to think of what permanent damage I might have caused myself now that I know I want to stick around past 30.
Sorry for rambling, I figured you guys might relate to this. And waking my bf at midnight to talk about this seems kind of messed up.
Edit: rephrased a small part.&lt;/p&gt;

i live in kentucky. every 6 months or so, i like to check the options for ed treatment (for if i ever wanna recover and it also just interests me). i found an article last year that states:

""In our state right now, there are zero acute care programs, zero residential and zero partial hospitalization programs,"" said Melissa Cahill, chair of Kentucky's Eating Disorder Council. ""So anyone diagnosed with this illness that needs a higher level of care than outpatient they are required to go out of state. That is their only option.""

how sad and disappointing is this? 

on top of that, i have Medicaid. as much of the state does as we are poor and rural. there is no help for people with my insurance. 

in 2018, i was gonna go residential. i had to call every. single. center in the United States (I am not exaggerating. I truly did) and only 2 were willing to accept kentucky/out of state Medicaid. it's not like it was easy either. I had to get a case worker and they had to communicate. it was pretty quick, but hard. 

i couldn't go because i couldn't afford transportation. 

people like me (poor) are forced to suffer. there is no help for us. 

why isn't there more treatment options across the country? even just ed specialists! especially with how common and deadly these diseases are!! why are people in the medical field still only taught about 20 mins worth of ed content? 

it's distressing and disheartening.

My wheels were so broken before, needing pusjing every 1/2 a second, and now I can go a couple of metres with one push.


I'm feeling so ridiculous for feeling guilty for this but also like for me if I use a chair I must at least be pushing myself. 
A big part of that is supporting a disabled EDed friend in very very serious life or death crisis who keeps deciding they are fine and then not engaging with services and then crashing and needing immediate suicide safety buddy irl, and I'm their only friend around right now, partly because told level of live or death crisis has been present for the 3 years I have known them.


I am currently the only one who can offer support and basic fulfil an in paid carer role (as they have a 2 week gap in care) which is honestly just destroying me. I missed a message from them last week and they ODed, not blaming me but I was at a pool.



They have me to talk about their ED behaviours with but it all.is becoming so so so so triggering. They need.support but have been rejected by the ED service due to normal bloods. They literally can not eat without others  around haven't seen people in two weeks. I'm an autistic introverted person in serious burn out but I'm kinda their therapist /  emergency mental health worker, but I'm not paid, I'm not coping and any bit of criticism puts this person at immediate risk of death .



The health services are in contact, but useless because we are in the uk. 


I don't know how to deal with this level of stress having lost two other trans disabled neurodivergent friends in the past year to suicide. And my friends have lost others.
I'm also a hermit, I.barely get out, can't really message anyone on the internet and am fighting for therapy and have been for years, with none materialising.


I'm aware if I don't do this work no one else is going to do it and if I miss or delay or just can't respond to one message, they might die.


I can't cope with this, but leaving could mean they die by suicide too. I can't deal with it, but I have to. And criticisms of them by other ex very close people recently have sent them into very active sui plans. 
I just have to do this. But I am dealing with my own crisis and don't have a support network. Not suicidal, but very passively.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"POTENTIAL TW: No specific weight numbers, but general discussion of weight and weight restoration.

I’ll try to make this as easy to understand as I can.

Context: I’m mid-30s, AN for 20 years, major relapse a year ago.

I’ve been working with a recovery life coach and dietitian on an outpatient basis, although everyone says I need a higher level of care. I don’t disagree, but I have many legitimate reasons (chronic illness, medical devices, among others) I cannot go to treatment and have actually been told by more than one they couldn’t accept me due to the above. We have tried every possible route, and they are not possible.

So while we all see the need, we’re also realistic about my options, which are limited and only include outpatient care right now. 

We were even starting to take a harm eduction approach in the context of treating my case as SE-AN/SE-ED (severe and enduring AN/ED), from a maintenance perspective, and I was following the agreed upon maintenance terms.

Then yesterday, my dietitian randomly gave me an ultimatum that includes significant weight restoration (something I’ve been unable to do on my own, despite trying, the last few months), and if I don’t reach those goals, she can’t ethically keep working with me on an outpatient basis.

I’m just scared. I was dropped by my therapist with no warning and no explanation several months ago (literally daily still dealing with the grief and trauma of that), and have been turned away from so many others I’ve contacted due to my precarious physical state, but going somewhere is not an option, and I don’t know how in the world I’m going to meet this nutritional rehabilitation/weight restoration as if it magically became doable.

Not having a therapist is why I’m in such a low spot; because no one is helping me figure out how to access hope and anything other than apathy, and I’m not saying it’s anyone else’s responsibility, but my therapist’s actions were 100% the straw that broke the camel’s back and left me feeling abandoned with absolutely no hope or reason to care about myself or recovery at all.

I love my dietitian. If I lose her, I lose my coach. If I lose my coach, to be honest, I’ll probably end up losing my life, because these past months without the support of someone helping me get at the root issues has proven I can’t do it on my own (I spend all day, every day trying to figure it out in my own, and it’s just super obvious I need guidance in that area to move forward).

I’m not absolving myself of the responsibility of taking action. I know we ultimately eventually have to find a way to do the things despite the paralyzing fear that makes us want to run away and never deal with anything ever again. But I’m also in a place where I’ve been unable to do  anything but barely tread water and maintain status quo since the therapist trauma happened, and I’m just terrified I’m going to fail and lose the support system who has thus far actually stuck with me. I don’t want to die…I just don’t know how to live or how to do this.

I’m sorry, I just really needed to get that out. Not looking for any specific response, and I’ll ask you, if it’s okay, to please not go any tough love direction with this. I know the reality, I now the truth, and after yesterday’s blindside in the name of “tough love” I had a full blown autistic meltdown and then shutdown for several hours. I appreciate the intention, but I’m too fragile to hear it this morning. Especially since it’s supposed to have my first thing on my meal plan in the next half hour and I’m freaking out.

**UPDATE**
Well, for dropped by my dietitian after committing to all of the above, and actually finally caring about this for the first time in 2022.

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to make this as easy to understand as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: I’m mid-30s, AN for 20 years, major relapse a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with a recovery life coach and dietitian on an outpatient basis, although everyone says I need a higher level of care. I don’t disagree, but I have many legitimate reasons (chronic illness, medical devices, among others) I cannot go to treatment and have actually been told by more than one they couldn’t accept me due to the above. We have tried every possible route, and they are not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while we all see the need, we’re also realistic about my options, which are limited and only include outpatient care right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were even starting to take a harm eduction approach in the context of treating my case as SE-AN/SE-ED (severe and enduring AN/ED), from a maintenance perspective, and I was following the agreed upon maintenance terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then yesterday, my dietitian randomly gave me an ultimatum that includes significant weight restoration (something I’ve been unable to do on my own, despite trying, the last few months), and if I don’t reach those goals, she can’t ethically keep working with me on an outpatient basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just scared. I was dropped by my therapist with no warning and no explanation several months ago (literally daily still dealing with the grief and trauma of that), and have been turned away from so many others I’ve contacted due to my precarious physical state, but going somewhere is not an option, and I don’t know how in the world I’m going to meet this nutritional rehabilitation/weight restoration as if it magically became doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having a therapist is why I’m in such a low spot; because no one is helping me figure out how to access hope and anything other than apathy, and I’m not saying it’s anyone else’s responsibility, but my therapist’s actions were 100% the straw that broke the camel’s back and left me feeling abandoned with absolutely no hope or reason to care about myself or recovery at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my dietitian. If I lose her, I lose my coach. If I lose my coach, to be honest, I’ll probably end up losing my life, because these past months without the support of someone helping me get at the root issues has proven I can’t do it on my own (I spend all day, every day trying to figure it out in my own, and it’s just super obvious I need guidance in that area to move forward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not absolving myself of the responsibility of taking action. I know we ultimately eventually have to find a way to do the things despite the paralyzing fear that makes us want to run away and never deal with anything ever again. But I’m also in a place where I’ve been unable to do  anything but barely tread water and maintain status quo since the therapist trauma happened, and I’m just terrified I’m going to fail and lose the support system who has thus far actually stuck with me. I don’t want to die…I just don’t know how to live or how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, I just really needed to get that out. Not looking for any specific response, and I’ll ask you, if it’s okay, to please not go any tough love direction with this. I know the reality, I now the truth, and after yesterday’s blindside in the name of “tough love” I had a full blown autistic meltdown and then shutdown for several hours. I appreciate the intention, but I’m too fragile to hear it this morning. Especially since it’s supposed to have my first thing on my meal plan in the next half hour and I’m freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;
Well, for dropped by my dietitian after committing to all of the above, and actually finally caring about this for the first time in 2022. Which means my coach is gone, too, and my sessions with her are the only reasons I’ve been able to stay alive this year. This is going to break me…the pain of constant abandonment and losing people I trust because I can’t get the level of care I need is a pain I cannot keep living through. (Not an unalive-ideation thing, I just think this pain of abandonment is more than I can handle.)&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"
I need some help here.  I don't know if I need to vent but I'm just feeling a lot of different things. 

I'm a 38 year old married mom of 2 (7 and 5).  I recently opened up to my husband about my eating disorder.  We've been married 9 years.. he's only know about it for 2.  

Since Covid... if you wanted to rate my ED, it was at a.. solid 5 going into Covid...it was there and the severity fluctuated but at the time it was manageable.   Fast forward to a few months ago and it's a 13 now.  

Originally I came out with my ED to my therapist. After some trial and error I found Christine.. and she has helped immensely.  I went from not being able to talk about it to anyone.. to now having a core group of people that know.. along with my husband.  I've also been in the Lakeridge ED program for the last 6 months and have now gotten myself into a private recovery facility.   Interesting when I read that.. because I feel so much failure not being able to do this on my own.  But I really have come a long way. 

Here is my problem.  I'm a mom.. I'm a wife... I have a full time job... it's not like I can just pick up and leave...and my presence not be missed.  This private inpatient program is 120 days.  I haven't been away from my kids more then 5 days in their little lives.  My parents caused me so much pain.  Especially my mom... the day I leave is going to be awful for my girls and the thought of me being the one to cause them that kind of pain.. it kills me.  And how does my husband not resent me?  Like how do I not feel guilt.  120 days is a long time to be a single parent.  I just think if I don't go to this therapy... I can't keep going how I'm going right now.  

But I also resent myself for not getting help sooner.  I've dragged my kids and husband unknowingly into this mess...I thought I had it under control... 

Is it worth it to go? 

What if it doesn't help?  

What if this changes things between my husband and I? 

I don't anticipate a magical cure... I don't think there is a cure... I hope to get the skills I need to help me cope with the ups and downs better.

I don&amp;#39;t know if I need to vent but I&amp;#39;m just feeling a lot of different things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 38 year old married mom of 2 (7 and 5).  I recently opened up to my husband about my eating disorder.  We&amp;#39;ve been married 9 years.. he&amp;#39;s only know about it for 2.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Covid... if you wanted to rate my ED, it was at a.. solid 5 going into Covid...it was there and the severity fluctuated but at the time it was manageable.   Fast forward to a few months ago and it&amp;#39;s a 13 now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I came out with my ED to my therapist. After some trial and error I found Christine.. and she has helped immensely.  I went from not being able to talk about it to anyone.. to now having a core group of people that know.. along with my husband.  I&amp;#39;ve also been in the Lakeridge ED program for the last 6 months and have now gotten myself into a private recovery facility.   Interesting when I read that.. because I feel so much failure not being able to do this on my own.  But I really have come a long way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my problem.  I&amp;#39;m a mom.. I&amp;#39;m a wife... I have a full time job... it&amp;#39;s not like I can just pick up and leave...and my presence not be missed.

 I fractured my ankle about 4 days ago and have just come home from the hospital (had a surgery midday so I'm writing this at night whilst the nerve blocker is wearing off finally haha) - its looking to be about 2 weeks of being very immobile plus 4 weeks of most likely similar levels of activity and I'm dreading it so so much.

So I don’t know why I did it.

I’ve been in recovery since early 2020, with only small blips of slip ups, but this year I’ve been inching further and further towards a total relapse.

After fucking up by using laxatives, I guess it’s safe to say that I’m relapsing.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Hi,

This is my first post ever. I would like to share my story because I haven't been able to share it with anyone IRL.

Recently, I realized that my relationship with food and my body image is not a healthy one. I've always had the idea that I was the ""fat kid"", and when I see pictures of my younger self I see a very skinny kid... That was the story back then, now I am actually overweight.

In my early 20s, I had a short period of losing weight drastically, it made me feel ""great"", in control, at a moment in which I was struggling with depression and PTSD after I was victim of&gt;!SA!&lt;. I enjoyed every kilo I lost, but I never got to be underweight. At the time, I was still living with my family and my mom quickly noticed something was wrong, and she helped me get out of there. However, the idea of me never feeling pretty enough has always been around. And yeah, in my head, thin equals pretty, at least for myself, because I completely see every body as unique and beautiful, all bodies except mine.

Now, I live alone. Everything was moderately well, until COVID came. I noticed that I started binge eating, whenever I was stressed, sad, or even happy. I kept eating more and more even when I was already full... and later, I felt ashamed, guilty, and I knew this wasn't something I wanted to share with my friends, but I didn't know there was such thing as BED.

I work in a very toxic environment, and I've tried multiple times to apply to different roles or to leave the company, but somehow, I can't manage to do it. Recently, something happened at work that just broke me and triggered insecurities and fears. Along with it, it also triggered my obsession with counting calories, over exercising, comparing my body to my friends', etc. I'm still overweight, hence in my head this is not serious, but I've read that you don't have to be underweight to suffer from an ED.

I don't have any question, actually. I just wanted to share my story as an adult finding out I may have an ED.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"So after a few years of binge/restrict cycles, I’m at my highest weight ever and I’m just not feeling good about myself. I’m trying to plan meals and loosely count calories so I’m not tempted to over or under eat and I’ve recently joined a gym that has good group fitness classes so I can start moving my body again a few times a week.

I feel like I’ve been doing very well with eating enough, I haven’t had any binges in weeks, and I’m not weighing myself obsessively. 

SO as a perk of joining you get several free semi-personal training sessions and the guy who was coaching me was pretty cool initially, and in general we got along well, but god he would not shut up about trying to tell me what to eat. 

Like, I didn’t ask for his opinion and I know I could lose some weight but like I don’t need someone telling me that protein makes you lose weight and carbs make you fat. This guy literally showed me an infographic for portion sizes of various foods, and the recommended portion size for veggies was like half the size of my palm. Not to mention, all of my safe foods are pretty much fruit or veggie related and now I’m afraid this guy is going to ruin them for me. I don’t want to overthink it because, I like this gym and I want to keep going, but I’m just annoyed that it’s been impossible for me to work out anywhere without someone trying to push some fad diet on me as though I don’t know how food works.

idk what im really meaning too say with this post, but since about mid feb ive been actively getting better- and embracing it this time instead of scrambling too feel in control &amp; like im deeply engaged in my ed. 

beginning too eat consistently, ive been trying let go of that feeling of urgency that i needed too get back into a mindset &amp; routine that enabled &amp; fuelled my ed instead  just allowing myself too engage in nourishing myself properly - and rly meaning it with no plan or end goal too make up or relapse. (i dont know how well im explaining this lol but oh well)

ofc in the past month or so there have been slip ups &amp; its all far from consistent. i think i still havent realised how many disordered thoughts r still lingering and whilst that comforts me i am now in a place where i can identify that its my ed that wants and clings too them thoughts and I myself can make the decision too tackle them or listen too them. being able too distinguish what *I * think vs what my *ed* thinks now is crazy ! 
actually quite proud of myself ahh !

I feel like im embracing 'recovery'? (word creeps me out lol cause it feels too official and final but whatever) too fast sometimes or not doing it right. almost wishing it felt harder or im not struggling enough. but then i think abt the 4 months or so before when i knew part of me desperately wanted too get better and i was fiercely pushing it away and fighting it off with fuelling my ed further cause i was just so scared. i kinda consider that period that id wanted &amp; was ready too recover for longer than i thought. and theres no such thing as too quick:)

honestly just taking it day by day lol i could wake up and completely change my mind tomorrow but at least ive seen what recov can bring and how good it can feel:) 
i think im just writing this too acknowledge how far ive come myself. 

No one in my family knows abt my ed in the first place &amp; i think my friends just think im still engaging in it. I've thought abt telling my best friend how things have changed recently but thats scary and feels like ive gotta commit too it then😳

Because for me, I'm laying in bed now that the days over and I can still only think of how badly I want the milkshake. But even if I had gotten it, I would have just felt guilty afterwards.

i have had disordered eating behaviours since i was 13 or 14 (im now 21). the first time i got diagnosed was when i was 18. i saw this psychologist only for a few months but i stopped going to her shortly after she diagnosed me. 

also i think it's important to mention that i have been going to therapy on and off for the majority of this past decade for my adhd, depression, and anxiety and this was the only time i brought up my actual behaviours, other than that i just talked about my body image and how i always thought i was fat and none of my psychologists or psychiatrists ever looked too much into it i think because i didn't go into too much detail and also i was not underweight. 

this brings us to right now, my ed is pretty bad at the moment and i don't particularly want to recover but i feel like i should tell my psychiatrist because it plays a big role in the way i feel and it triggers all my other non ed self destructive behaviours. i am afraid that he will expect me to recover or think that i am the reason for all my problems which is actually true i guess but i just don't want to let go of this. i am also very scared of being invalidated in any way and if I'm going to tell him then every part of me wants to restrict and get a lot worse so i can feel like i actually deserve to be telling him.

I've been dealing with this in silence for the last 15ish years but recently confided in my husband and close close friends.  I've been enrolled in an outpatient program for the last 6 months but it's not working.  I think there's just too much going on in my life for me to devote the attention I needed to towards my recovery. 

I've now been referred to the Homewood ED inpatient program in Guelph ON.  What I'm really looking for are peoples experiences....Obviously a day in the life of the ED program would be great.. just so I can know what to expect.  But any experiences with Homewood would be welcome.  (What did you bring)

Another question... what's recovery feel like?  What does it feel like when you finally fight your ED and win?  Do you gain weight?  If so how do you cope?  Do you like yourself at the end?

I feel like a huge failure and I was FINALLY feeling like my life was getting put together. Now all of this stress makes me basically starve myself. All I can do is obsess about my weight, about how I want to lose weight, the inflammation in my body. And then being at my moms triggers me beyond belief because she has Cushings and a ton of health issues that terrify me. I have an extreme fear of gaining weight and looking like her and being so unhealthy, so especially when I’m around her my restriction and orthorexia gets extreme. I’ve been living off celery, tea, cucumbers, and stupid shit. I guess im just here for support and connection. I feel like a 32 year old failure. My Ed and health issues and body image issues keep me from going out and enjoying my life. I’ve missed two of my favorite musicians concerts in the last 2 weeks due to auto immune flare ups , weight gain, and physical / emotional stress . Any support is appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

This week, different colleagues have become involved, but one was… rough.

Anyway, my issue is: I'm really embarrassed for people I date to see my body. I can wear tight clothes but I feel like it kind of hides all my boney areas. Like, my butt looks pretty perky under leggings but without that, my tailbone juts out quite a bit. For example, I thought it looked okay until I was sending a photo of my new leggings to this guy and I looked like stick. I felt disgusting and I couldn't even get myself to send anything bc no way that would be attractive to them (that's how I feel, not saying this is how it actually is.) :( I truly hate how thin I am but that doesn't make my ED go away.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Hey, I'm posting here primarily to get some advice (non-medical) and secondly to sense check my own thoughts. Does it fall under the umbrella of an ED? My old therapist and google seems to think so.

**Some background:** 

I'm 31 and male, I've had what I'm coming to realise might be an ED since I was about 18/19. I've given it several, less harsh names over the years - such as ""being a foodie"" or ""not having a good relationship with food"" or even just ""having a big appetite"". Basically this was all so that I could avoid acknowledging that this is more than likely some kind of ED linked to binge eating.

Most people I know wouldn't think I had one because most of the time I only let myself see people when I'm in pretty good shape. The rest of the time though I've put on a lot of weight again and therefore hide myself away, so to them it's out of sight out of mind. To me it's constantly balancing between food hell and purgatory.

I've basically yo-yo'd the same 15-25kg in bodyweight a great deal of times (about 2-3 times a year) since I was 18. My ""routine"" is basically as follows: I'll spend about 4 months punishing myself with gruelling exercise and low calorie targets (1100-1400 cals a day) and restrict myself to only super ""clean"" food. This 4month-ish period is punctuated with weak moments where I'll spend a day or two binge eating, I'll clock in at about 13-16,000 cals a day (I can eat a lot). Once I've achieved my desired weight/look I then maintain for about a month and then fall off the wagon by spending the next 1-2 months in what feels like a hole of binge eating, I'll take in about 8,000 cals or more a day. Every single day I'll try to ""get back on the wagon again"" and get super motivated, to which I will then go into what I can only describe as autopilot and binge eat for half a day and then despise myself and regret it once it's over. After about a month or two of this I've put all the weight back on, and I get to my ""enough is enough"" weight and start all over again. Rinse and repeat. It's exhausting and it's slowly ruining my life.

Since reaching 30 I've slowly but surely tried to confront myself that this is a serious problem. It has made me hate a good chunk of the past 13 years. The consequences of having it has cost me relationships and friendships due to spouts of super low confidence and sneak eating.

So that's my background.

I'm posting this partly to share my experience but mainly to get general advice and ideas of next steps once you've made the initial leap of acknowledging there might be a problem.

&lt;p&gt;Most people I know wouldn&amp;#39;t think I had one because most of the time I only let myself see people when I&amp;#39;m in pretty good shape. The rest of the time though I&amp;#39;ve put on a lot of weight again and therefore hide myself away, so to them it&amp;#39;s out of sight out of mind. To me it&amp;#39;s constantly balancing between food hell and purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve basically yo-yo&amp;#39;d the same 15-25kg in bodyweight a great deal of times (about 2-3 times a year) since I was 18. My &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; is basically as follows: I&amp;#39;ll spend about 4 months punishing myself with gruelling exercise and low calorie targets (1100-1400 cals a day) and restrict myself to only super &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; food. This 4month-ish period is punctuated with weak moments where I&amp;#39;ll spend a day or two binge eating, I&amp;#39;ll clock in at about 13-16,000 cals a day (I can eat a lot). Once I&amp;#39;ve achieved my desired weight/look I then maintain for about a month and then fall off the wagon by spending the next 1-2 months in what feels like a hole of binge eating, I&amp;#39;ll take in about 8,000 cals or more a day. Every single day I&amp;#39;ll try to &amp;quot;get back on the wagon again&amp;quot; and get super motivated, to which I will then go into what I can only describe as autopilot and binge eat for half a day and then despise myself and regret it once it&amp;#39;s over. After about a month or two of this I&amp;#39;ve put all the weight back on, and I get to my &amp;quot;enough is enough&amp;quot; weight and start all over again. Rinse and repeat. It&amp;#39;s exhausting and it&amp;#39;s slowly ruining my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since reaching 30 I&amp;#39;ve slowly but surely tried to confront myself that this is a serious problem. It has made me hate a good chunk of the past 13 years. The consequences of having it has cost me relationships and friendships due to spouts of super low confidence and sneak eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m posting this partly to share my experience but mainly to get general advice and ideas of next steps once you&amp;#39;ve made the initial leap of acknowledging there might be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;

Thank You for taking the time to read my post. I just needed to say this out loud......here goes,

They say the Lark sings the sweetest song while free but in the contrast of captivity it refuses to sing, preferring to watch its own life slip away. 

As long as I can remember I had an eating disorder in some shape or form. 

Binge eating as a child, anorexia as a teenager and during my twenties, bulimia in my early thirties and drunkorexia in the second half of my thirties.  

When I look back now allowing myself not to obstruct my vision. I can identify my twenty first year as the moment when my eating disorder became unmanageable. Which was also when I joined the world of engineering. 

Those 17+ years I like to think resemble an inferno and all the items and moments personal to me were the things consumed by those flames.

I never thought I would live long enough due to my own intentions to be a engineer of 17+ years. Unlike my colleagues I won't speak about the awards I won or the projects I will be remembered by. 

If anyone wants to ask, I will answer truthfully and without any prejudice to my own detriment. Though I would prefer everyone lets this period of my vocation pass like a saga which has long escaped from the storytellers vocabulary. 

I will remember the restricting, the fasting, the cold, the shaking, the never ending hunger, the unquenchable thirst, the pride &amp; sorrow of the scales, the loss of friends, the absence of memories, truth, trust and finally the lost potential. 

 It has been over two weeks since I fixed my face and affirmed my actions. I felt it apt to write these words as a requiem to my time long past and now consign these memories to posterity. 

Now finally I can feel the direction of the wind has changed from easterly to westerly. I am no longer shaking.

dae go through month(s) long phases of
either straight up binging/overeating and
gaining back the weight they lost- not rly
caring abt the weight gain- just so they can see how much/quick they can loose it again.

I feel like the reason gaining doesnt bother
me when im in these phases is because i
just think 'ig the higher i get now the bigger
the weight loss will look'. like i know what ive gained the past month or so its not that
noticeable too others i think &amp; ik i look
healthier and like theres actual blood in me
now lol but i feel like im just addicted too
the feeling of starting from beginning again and getting sucked back into the restriction world as quick and violently as possible. idk how too explain.

engaging in it and i forget how tired and low

just feels addicting - is this a common

Although I have sleepless nights and wake up in panic every time I hear a plane (I life next to an airport) my urge to constantly stuff my face is gone. Purging has gone down from 2-3 times a day to maybe 1. I think half as much about food as before. I am in constant fear and distress, but now it&amp;#39;s for different reasons. Anyone else suddenly doing &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; ? Might it be because of existential threat? My greatest wish right now is that all ends well and I send all my love to Ukraine. I also hope that my ED will not make a comeback when this is over, just because it has it&amp;#39;s space back in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

idk if this comes down too black &amp; white thinking but id like too think it doesnt make my struggles invalid. 
its like my normal brain and disordered brain are just constantly in split and somedays my healthy brain and thoughts are more prominent and some days the other. i am kinda grateful i can still access /engage with these more normal thoughts and behaviours without such an emotional impact but I also hate it and wish i was just continuously in the sicker mindset. 

I feel so guilty and invalid for it but I need too know if others w an ed feel the same way/experience similar patterns. Like some days / weeks i am able too eat consistently fairly normal. (maintenance amounts ig and not rly measuring/weighing, eating 'forbidden' foods w not too much distress) and maybe a few odd moments of overeating/ engaging in purging, or weighing food as the ed voice creeps back in. And biggest not caring (as much) or discarding counting cals.  

And then it feels like so quickly my brain can  brain flip back too restriction and caring about an individual cal and measuring everything and just such intense ed thoughts. it feels like daily idk what im gonna wake up with. but when i care about it i *care* but then the next day even i wont mind as much. 

is this normal within eds? i feel like if i rly was disordered there wouldn't be such a constant split and engagement in opposite behaviours/ thoughts.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"For the past decade or so, I’ve engaged in at least one form of self-harm at any given time (including my ED and trichotillomania/dermatillomania, which are considered by some professionals as SH). I’ve self-punished for longer than that by using (extremely) negative self-talk brought on by rigid perfectionism. I can’t stand the words ‘indulgent’ or ‘self-care’ and can’t ever EVER let an SO spoil me (yuck). I can’t enjoy childhood favorite foods even in small quantities that would fit within my allotted calories and feel embarrassed to even crave them. I have shameful fantasies about being cared for like a child which is just more fuel for negative behaviors. I make up awful theories about why my boyfriend secretly wants to leave me. I ruminate over every tiny mistake not because the mistake in itself is always bad but because of how it makes me perceived by others as stupid, unreliable, etc. I’m empathetic to those who are forced to interact with me because I know how painfully awkward and odd I can be. I can’t admit I have t——- (I can’t even allow myself to say it when talking about my problems) because others have it so much worse and it’s a total stretch comparatively to say I have it.

Why should I show myself compassion when I’ve consistently let myself and others down and make others uncomfortable? Why do I need it in the first place? If I showed myself compassion I would lose my edge, my discipline - I would become a spoiled, lazy slob (not that I’m far from it already). 

This is what makes it so hard for me to get better or even want to get better. I willingly punch walls, slap myself, starve, purge, say mean things to myself, etc. because it’s easier than facing the disgust I feel for the person in the mirror.

I've told my boyfriend that I had a history of eating disorders, although I've never said much past. ""hey, i have a history, please don't talk to me about X, Y, or Z.""

He often slipped up. I sometimes reminded him.  It isn't intentional - he has ADHD (as do I), so he was just mindlessly blabbering.

And he's slipping up. He keeps bringing up how little he's eaten.  He forgets to eat during the day, or doesn't have time, so he complains about it.

The other day he was listing off everything he had eaten that day, and I just felt so disgusted and ashamed that I had eaten more.  I should have told him there and then to cut it... but I just didn't.

I went in for a general check up today. For the past two weeks I've been restricting and have lost a little weight. Brief background...I went through inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa in 2013.

Anyway, I told my primary physician what's going on and that it's a little concerning. She wasn't my primary in 2013 but knows my history. One thing she said really got to me. She asked what my lowest weight was when I was inpatient and I told her. Then she said because I'm older now (I'm 60) I wouldn't be able to get that low again so I shouldn't worry.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"So this is basically just my obsessive thoughts and something I have been wondering about since forever.

I am quite underweight atm, but regularly experience HUGE binge episodes, think eating 6000 to 10,000 calories in a day within a span of 1 to 5 hours. (This is minus my bmr by the way so those calories are excess, and on top of my daily bmr) by that logic I should gain 2 pounds or 1 KG every time I binge/do this. Yet this DOESN'T seem to be the case. When I fast for 2 to 4 days after a binge. (I do not exercise during fasts) I lose all of the gained weight plus more despite only burning like half or less of the calories I binged on the days before.

It makes me paranoid. How does it work? My measurements do not go up either. Yet when you go on quora for example, doctors say you absolutely would gain 1 kg with my behavior cause you eat the calories in surplus, it is science. But is it really? It's just something that REALLY bothers me cause there seems to be NO clear cut answer to my question on this.

Cause even fasting for 4 days for me is not even 5000 calories cause low bmr, yet I still lose all my binge weight? am I not absorbing calories? Are they hiding inside me? I don't get it, and google doesn't help, it says yes we do gain weight from binges but they talk about a binge and say ''3000'' calories, which is a huge LOL for me. I have been basically maintaining now going through binge and restrict but I SHOULD be gaining when looking at my binge episodes. Every day I am scared this weight is secretly hiding inside me and I am going to wake up 20 plus pounds heavier over night someday really soon.

I have been basically maintaining now going through binge and restrict but I SHOULD be gaining when looking at my binge episodes. Every day I am scared this weight is secretly hiding inside me and I am going to wake up 20 plus pounds heavier over night someday really soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not over calculating my binge calories, they are HORRIFIC. Is there any science on this? I know this is not normal behaviour btw, I am trying very hard to stop binges.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Hey guys

30, F. Hoping to try for a baby in the near future, maybe later this year. 

I’m not sure how long I haven’t had periods for because I’ve been on the contraceptive pill since I was a teenager for the most part of my 20s. Stopped the pill a year ago, no period since, for the first 6 months I was hoping that it might just be my body adjusting but I’m sure it’s probably my weight. My bmi is &gt;!15.5!&lt; pretty sure I’ve had periods about 5-7kg ago, but I just don’t think I can be ok with putting that weight on now. I know it’s so vain and self indulgent and I should be mature enough to be sensible about it but I know I would just hate myself. 

Ultimately I’m trying to find a solution where my body could be healthy enough for a baby while still feeling comfortable in my own skin but I just don’t know how to get there. I have stupid negotiations going on in my head like, would my periods come back if I worked hard and gained that weight in only muscle? I see pregnant women that are my size or smaller, how are they doing it???

For reference I don’t actually feel that deep in my disorder, I’ve maintained this weight for a long time, I eat a reasonable amount, I have a highly functioning life. It definitely doesn’t consume me like it used to

i feel guilty abt it but it infuriates me when my mum will comment on what i eat. its not meant in a bad way actually meant as praise im sure, i just hate it. 

e.g. for the past 8 months ive been vegetarian going vg (wrong reasons too begin w but its getting there). And she'll always comment asking, What im eating, How i made it etc saying 'she wants too be more healthy like me' or asking 'do u still eat bread? ' or 'don't u crave meat or sugar or anything?'. Or someone will comment saying i need too 'use oil in that pan or itll burn- why havent u put oil in?' 
like DUDE. Over my life that shits not going in back off. 

my mum will always be inquisitive about what im eating. it causes so much friction because ill try shut her down straight away &amp; be horrible about it which i feel guilty for, but Then feel even more guilty because i feel not 'disordered enough' if ppl r wanting too eat like this. stupid ik. And when i decide too eat outside my normal time frame or im having a snack she says flippant things like 'how are you always eating and still stay looking like that.' or 'god you eating Again!?' &amp; i just feel so guilty even though its not meant in a bad way.

growing up anything like dieting would be  seperated from us as kids but now she'll say things like 'oh cant eat that how am i gonna loose weight if i eat like this' or  'yes you buy those again they have so much less cals or fat' and she begins too eat / take interest in my foods or even worse my sfs🥲 but she says these things with pride in a way like shes kinda proud too be aware of cals etc. fair enough ik dieting culture is normal but i always feel im in competition. even though ik were not and she isn't counting or anything- it just does.

I LOVE cooking and am actually fairly good but cooking what i eat for everyone is stressful for so many reasons- not only cant i measure it correctly if i do but i also DONT WANT them too eat what i do. not because its unhealthy food or something bcs its not, but because then I feel if they do, im not disordered since ppl want/r choosing too eat this too.

But I also know that entirely socially isolating myself is a recipe for many mental health disasters. The only way I can manage to have any personality, sense of humor, or interest in anything other than my ED is to get at least 2 or 3 units of alcohol in me. It's also just nice to have a vacation from my ED-addled wasteland of a mind. I don't drink alone--only when I have to socialize with other people, but that's turning into binge drinking (around 4 drinks on a totally empty stomach which hits me like 8) at least 3 nights a week.

""Socializing with other people"" includes being around the guy I'm seeing as well, because no WAY can I flirt or fuck sober. I just cannot be a fully engaged, interesting/interested human being while sober. Sober me is a brain-fogged, calorie counting, cabbage leaf weighing, kitchen pacing, shivering, passionless zombie. But slightly toasted me is witty, adventurous, charismatic, and sexy. It's the me I'm only occasionally capable of being fully-recovered, which is not an option.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"TW: calories

So guess whose nurse spent a big chunk of our meeting talking about the calories in corn cakes (same product as rice cakes but taste a little bit less like cardboard). Well, that would be my nurse.

Long story short, a few years ago I lost a lot of weight, became disordered, went into therapy, got out of disordered tendencies, gained half of the weight back and am now in the process of seeing a nurse monthly about making sustainable changes to the way I eat to lose weight in a very long scale window. My doctor said I shouldn’t lose weight unsupervised.

I’ve been hella unmotivated recently and have been eating more than I should and have thus gained weight. I told the nurse as much. For some UNGODLY reason she became completely focused on me eating corn cakes instead of bread (a remnant from my ED days yes, but also they have a long shelf life and I genuinely, hand on a Bible, enjoy eating them with toppings like salmon, they have a nice crunch). 

So, the nurse literally googles the calorie count in one corn cake (”what could it weigh? 15 grams” ”I don’t know, I DON’T WEIGH MY FOOD ANYMORE”) and she was like SHOCKED that two corn cakes had 100 or so calories. They fucking don’t by the way, I checked as I got home and they’re lighter than she thinks. I was really annoyed and told her that I don’t think the point of this meeting is to discuss the calorie count of corn cakes. But the damage was already done.

Fuck the corn cakes. I feel guilty as hell eating them. Two rice cakes topped with salmon. The biggest crime ever. She told me I should eat veggies to fill up my stomach (sus?). I bought a few kilograms of carrots. I ate four carrots today and then had my evening meal and now my stomach hurts so fucking bad so I guess I filled it TOO MUCH with ”delicious” carrots. Fuck having any enjoyment in food anymore. My day comprises now of forcing myself to eat bland, boring food four times a day. And when I do eat something I like, I feel guilty about it. Yay!

I’m salty as hell because on the other hand, of course I’d like to weigh less but I’d also like to enjoy what I eat. Guess that’s impossible. I already suffered hunger and eating small amounts of stupid shit for 1,5 years, guess I’m ready to go again. I’m sorry for venting and being whiny. I just didn’t need an outside push to start feeling guilty about food again. I’m also not gonna see her again.

Also don’t get me started on being so fucking mad I gained all this weight back eating what feels to me like nothing. Why have I gained weight when I didn’t even get to binge McD’s and potato chips every day? Why did I gain weight eating dark chocolate and bigger proportions of normal food? It makes me so TIRED!!!!

And I’m so sorry, this will probably get me kicked out of here, but sometimes I’m so resentful I went into therapy. I was at my smallest and felt so in control. A false sense of control of course.

the only thing is i just can tell anymore if im too hungry or full. i feel constantly bloated as soon as im awake. i go from feeling starving in the morning and sick too feeling so full after eating or drinking one thing ( like a sip of water or a gummy vitamin). i go too bed feeling sick from being so full and plan too restrict the next day and then when the day comes i just want too eat again. when i cant tell if i feel
full or not is it better too eat or not? i rly dont know.

I ate food during the day, in front of other people. I even talked to a friend about my ED. And now, the witch that caused my layoff not only took my livelihood &amp; my benefits away, but robbed me of my recovery gains, too.

Obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. And my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised CBT for the ED, to DBT.

The DBT is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ED relapse. As part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours (doesn't have to be ED related, but for example restricting) so I can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks.

I'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if I can't say I'm fully there yet. 

I have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. I had to stop going on reddit tbh. Also, Disclaimer I had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ED, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. Once that was out of the way I really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I read that researchers are exploring psilocybin as a novel treatment for body dysmorphia, feeding and eating disorders, so I want to share my experience with magic mushrooms and the overall impact this has had on my body image. 

I hope to hear from others who have had experiences (both helpful and unhelpful) with this, as well. 

I recently tried psilocybin for the first time, and I now incorporate it into a sort-of-structured routine of microdosing every few months. 

People always say, “don’t look in the mirror” on psychedelics. But looking in the mirror on mushrooms is the first time I feel I’ve ever truly seen myself — visibly exhausted, sick, and starved from striving to be *enough* of anything, at the request of no one.

This sounds like a negative experience but truly it has been overwhelmingly positive for my self-image. Having had an opportunity to see myself as “enough,” and knowing that this perspective is available to me from time to time, has been very freeing. 

I have always viewed myself as a strong woman, but the person I saw in the mirror a was girl visibly burdened by shame, self-doubt, and fear of losing control. The overwhelming sense of compassion I have toward myself when I see her is so valuable. In my normal life, I have discovered an enhanced ability to offer myself graciousness, patience, and breathing room to explore. This trickles down to how I interact with others who are existing on this planet, as well. 

I looked at my sweet baby cats and my dogs and I saw souls who exist to explore life, who view me as their everything, and who (if they have emotions) probably would be heartbroken to know how much I feel like not enough. 

I realized how much energy I put toward focusing on myself and trying to control things, and how brief my time with my pets will be. And how many opportunities to go on walks and to breathe in their fur and to kiss their face I stand to miss if I don’t recognize my chains from this disorder, or evaluate why they are there, or ask why I am so unwilling to fight them. I can see now that my disorder is not my friend and it will never stop demanding more from me. Life is out there, and it will never tell me the truth about that. 

I am not recovered and I don’t think this will ever be “fixed,” but being able to understand the truth of what this is, at least momentarily, has been so helpful.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Warning, long winded rant ahead:
I first fell into Anorexia at 14, weight restored, over compensated and relapsed every few years - you know how it goes. Along with this there’s a ton of other mental health issues and chronic suicidality.
In 2020 at 35 I was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer.
(Part of me is always going to wonder if this kicked off due to my ED). Now being told I was going to die actually helped with the suicidal ideation which was a plus but a side effect of the cancer, major surgery, an ileostomy and chemo is pretty dramatic weight loss.
Cue being hellishly triggered. So I dropped to below my old relapse adult GW without even trying which I can’t deny made me giddy with happiness.
Then treatment finished and I was told I was in remission. I was happy. I was thin, feeling better and not suicidal for once.
But of course, with my new found “health” and the fact I hadn’t reached the weight by counting calories or exercising once treatment finished I slowly started piling back on the kilos.
I don’t keep scales in the house and knew I had gained a lot visually and with clothing, I just didn’t know how much.
Recently some of the cancer symptoms came back so 
this morning I had a PET scan to see where things were at.
They weighed me.
I had gained 20kg since I finished chemo 6 months ago. Having resigned myself to the fact the cancer was back and I’d soon lose it again anyway I didn’t have a nervous breakdown on the spot. 
I just got the report from the scan and it says I’m still clear. Still in remission.

I should be over the moon but instead I’ve been sobbing wishing I was dying because now I’m fat. 
I have cancer for fucks sakes. It’s eventually going to come back and kill me, I shouldn’t care one iota what my weight is, I have four children and a loving husband I should focus on spending any time I’ve got left with them and yet all I can think about is being up 20kg and how I’m not physically able to run or even walk far anymore to burn it off.

is it possible to enter a partial remission of sorts without making active steps towards recovery? 
im in a phase ig of what would appear as getting better. iim currently gaining weight i think &amp; although id be devastated if it passed out of the UW section on the bmi- (even though its bs), im still not restricting too compensate that much. im not really using many compensatory behaviours but i do still keep certain food rituals etc. 

i am probs stuggling way more than i think. like food is still 24/7 my thoughts the plans too restrict are always cropping up. whenever my eds challenged like eating out &amp; staying away it seems too panic and get worse, but other than that im eating at least maintenance i think and always end up stopping tracking throughout  day because i just loose the reason too. 

i think what i worry is that since right now im not struggling too much compared too other times in my ed, that this current phase wasnt improved though engaging or planning too 'recover' in the sense off WG and less disordered behaviour etc do i even still have an ed like is it still there lurking for the opportunity too grip me again. Is possible for it too quieten for periods of time but like once you've got it you'll have it in whatever form until you commit too a full recovery?  i don't plan on staying in this phase, im just waiting until other circumstances push me down the ed spiral again.  i worry was it even that bad throughout all the different cycles ive been in over the last 18 months if im sometimes able too reach this point of less disorderedness ? and reaching a healthier weight by myself. Will my ed always be there in some form until i start recovery and commit too full recov? god i hope it is😳

sry so long wow just need opinions/help.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Somewhat off topic, but I figured you all might understand my concerns. 

I've lost enough weight the last few months that my clothes do not fit. Pants won't stay up, shirts sliding off shoulders, etc. 

I'm trying to find sites online to order some new ones. I went to sites I remember liking in the past, as well as basic sites like Target and Amazon.

I feel like most stores right now have one of two styles.

One - SUPER form fitting clothes, shorter shirts, crop tops, or a ton of cleavage. Generally just designed to draw attention to your body and screams, ""Look at me!""

Two - Shapeless, super oversized blouses that hang like  potato sacks.

The thought of wearing something form fitting gives me a literal panic attack. I do not want something that highlights my flaws. I do not want a shirt that will show my stomach if I lift my arms. I really don't want to draw attention to any part of body in any way, shape, or form. 

At the same time, I'm also wanting to look slightly more put together than hiding behind extra baggy oversized shirts (and I'm tired of baggy clothes drawing attention to my weight loss).

So where do you like to shop? What stores do you buy your clothes from? Are there stores that have cute clothes that have something in between, ""I'm a Kardashian,"" and ""I'm an Amish farmer?""

I’m really struggling here. I’m in the middle of an endometriosis flare that has me SO bloated. I’m talking 5+ lbs and over 2 inches at the waistline basically overnight.

I’m pretty sure a change in medication is what triggered it, so besides trying to manage the side effects, there’s nothing I can really do to “fix” this besides waiting for my system to adjust.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I started losing weight again super quickly after breaking up with my BF of 6 years last July. 
He cheated on me with a girl I’d always been jealous of how skinny she was.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I capped at 275lbs by the time I was 18 or so. I am 26 now. I moved away from my abusive home that promoted obesity as Fun and “Fuck it why not” mentality. 


To be completely blunt with you…I don’t want to change. On one hand, of fucking course I do or I wouldn’t be posting this, pleading for help… But… I’ve been this weight and had this routine for So long.. It’s frighteningly daunting to change. I don’t even believe my body is capable of shedding a single pound. 


The sound of exercise is horrifying with how bad my body hurts even walking, and how bad my asthma is. I can’t do much before my lungs are completely on fire and I’m in tears. 


I work full time at a semi active job, because my previous more active job had my back constantly seizing up and making lasting injuries just trying to clean hotel rooms. And even this job is painful for me and i’ve been looking for sedentary jobs that stop hurting me so much… 

When I get home, I have only a few hours before I need to go to sleep for work. So I…as much as I hate to admit, refuse to waste any of that time exercising. I want to enjoy my life, doing things indoors. Knowing my weight, I only have so much time left to enjoy anyways and I have art commissions for my side hustle to do digitally. 


Until I am able to have my own place to live, I am stuck with my boyfriend’s parents who honestly spike my c-ptsd since his mom isn’t much different than mine. So I don’t leave the room. I don’t cook meals unless everyone in the house is asleep and it’s a quiet meal. But lord knows if I will bother to “cook meals” in my own place either. 


I lack self restraint/control, I can’t bring it up in therapy because we are focusing on reprocessing so many different traumatic situations, we don’t have time for stupid food talk. 


I have a nutritionist prescribed to me and even though she 100% understands my current situation…she wasn’t even sure how to help. She said she wouldn’t tell me “don’t eat this.”, but rather “eat smaller portions of this.” which is completely fair. 


But I am fucking hungry. I cannot focus on anything as my ravenous brain IMMEDIATELY starts seeking food until I am Literally about to vomit from being so full. It’s never satisfied. 

I am trying to get officially diagnosed, in August, Again with Adhd since I know my old meds used to suppress these food seeking desires… but right now I just can’t stand to be alive. Having to hide under layers of clothes, be embarrassed by how much space I take up everywhere, how when I walk into fast food, people don’t seem shocked at all that someone like me is there. 


I don’t know what to do… Something that won’t make me hurt; wont make me breathless; wont make me physically shake from hunger despite having just ate a full meal; yet is magically easy and simple to do…

I blame myself entirely. I really do. My mom promoted over eating, but it was my fault I didn’t restrain myself.. It’s my fault I am such a toddler, pouting about hating exercise (I can walk but it hurts my back that I can’t do it for too many miles..) and having to physically do any work when all I want is the damn meds to fucking stop me from feeling hunger…

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I promise I am not trying to invalidate anyone. I see so many posts about how feeling super hungry when going to bed, or feeling like passing out, for example, make people feel successful and powerful etc.

This is not my experience at all. I hate these things. When I get hungry, it is extreme pain, and it makes my chest hurt too. When I feel like I’m about to pass out, when my vision starts to fade, the spots appear, things are spinning, I have to hold onto whatever is near me or sit down… I’m worried I’ll hit my head harder than ever the next time I fall or faint.

I was at my lowest weight in June, when I met my boyfriend. He is the most supportive person I have ever met and he’s just incredible in so many ways. 

We started living together not long after we met (very fast paced, I know) but everything has gone amazingly since. I am 100 times happier than I was and probably 100 times healthier. 

Since we started living together, he has kept me on track with eating meals (I had told him about my ED at this point) and I’ve gained 20 pounds. 

Now, my boyfriend likes my body. When we first met he even said it was ideal. Even now, he says he probably wouldn’t have noticed ifI hadn’t told him but now I’ve gained weight I feel incredibly gross. 

I know he means the best, but he has said “I like that you have a little more meat on your bones” which, obviously, I don’t want to hear. As he says, he’s “got a sickness for the thickness.” Not in a bad way I guess, he’s said that if he thought I was getting unhealthy overweight he’d tell me. 

Looking back at photos of myself in June, I have incredible cheekbones. I miss them haha. I miss being at the lowest weight I’ve ever been since I stopped getting taller. I miss the way my legs looked and I’m so insecure about my belly and upper arms. 

Obviously, back then I didn’t see a change. But now I do. And I miss it. I’m trying to work out more and all. I don’t know.

My doctor's are not super well-versed in the reproductive side of ED's and I haven't needed any gynecological care since I'm not having sex atm. So basically, I'm 22 and female. Had my period for less than a year between the ages of twelve and thirteen when I developed my ED. I have Anorexia Nervosa and lost my period very quickly as I was already naturally underweight when my disorder developed so it ended up going away completely very early on. I did not experience any period for multiple years, and at one point after treatment, I had a period come back with very light bleeding for a very short time (less than six months) before relapsing so it was completely irregular. Basically this means, that I have never experienced a regularly occurring period. At this point, my BMI has been severely underweight for a number of years but I remember having some bleeding at a still slightly underweight BMI for my height, I have gotten a period at around 90-95 pounds and am 5'4. I have maintained a weight of under 75 lbs for well over a year at this point but have noticed that every couple of weeks I experience hormonal symptoms but with zero bleeding. For example, I never have any and every couple of weeks I get a terrible breakout, stomach cramping, I gain between 3 and 6 pounds overnight, headaches, pretty much all the PMS symptoms. I decided to begin tracking when this was occurring and have realized that it happens every 26 days or so, and the symptoms last for about five days. Also constipation.

I'm eating maintenance or higher, I'm stretching to keep my muscles from seizing up but I'm not actually exercising, I'm averaging between 7-8 hours of sleep.

Like if you're just looking at behaviors, things are better than they've been in the last 2 years.  But honestly my head has gone the complete opposite direction. I think I'm the only family member that hasn't cried since the event.  Honestly, I haven't felt much of anything. 

I've spent most of the time since it happened jumping between SM platforms in infinite browsing/ scrolling mode.  I feel hollow.  Since there's nothing I can do to make the situation any better, I feel helpless.

Even though I'm averaging a good amount of sleep, I simultaneously feel like I'm sleeping too much and not enough.  There's a part of me that just wants to shut down completely, and another part that won't stop going 100 miles an hour.

Even though I'm eating to fuel  my body, I definitely feel like it's too much.  I'm nearly tempted to see what happens if I act on all the thoughts and behaviors running through my head. I'm uncomfortable with eating so much anyway.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Longtime lurker who made an account to vent about this here bc I don't have anyone irl who would understand. I feel so stupid being upset about it so many years later but I just can't believe I never made the connection.

Towards the end of primary school/beginning of junior high, I developed really severe food allergies and had to go on a VERY restrictive diet that resulted in me losing a lot of weight. It was an extremely stressful time for my family, and I almost died no less than three times over the course of about two years due to mistakes with foods. I remember being really frustrated with how my body had failed me, and developing a lot of anxiety about food in general.

In the midst of struggling with this and trying to adapt, all the kids around me were honestly terrible. I never really comprehended it at the time, but looking back, it's no wonder things got bad later. I was constantly made a spectacle of for having to eat different foods, was asked invasive questions, was accused of doing it for attention, had rumors spread around that I was anorexic (which is ironic now, considering that I have a restrictive ED lmao). It was around this time that I remember beginning to hate my body's appearance, as well as actively dreading and avoiding social situations that involved food.

It just makes me so fucking pissed to think about.

i feel instant shame, regret, dread, a sad kind of nostalgia that doesn’t even make sense. i feel so cursed by this disorder. i feel fucking ridiculous every time i see older photos and think, “wow you were way thinner then compared to now, and you were still miserable about how you thought you looked. so sad, you should have embraced it cuz you look like shit now.” the existential dread i feel by “wasting” my youngest years i’ll ever have hating how i look is so intense. one of my biggest fears is feeling this way for the rest of my life; becoming an old woman wishing i could have just seen that everything was fucking fine and that i was beautiful the way i was. that all my misery was my own fault, and if i could have just finally broke through this disgusting fog of self loathing everything would have been warm and happy like 1970s film. but i was in my own way, and i couldn’t do it. 

the amount of suffering i still feel, while trying to recover feels almost worse if not exactly the same as how i felt at my absolute sickest. my relationship with my body, and food is still so fucked and it’s so hard not to just give up and accept that this is going to stay with me for the rest of my life. that sometimes it’s just “not in the cards” for some people to get better and feel self love no matter how hard they try physically and mentally. if anything, sometimes i feel like my relationship with both is even worse than when it all started but i don’t know. it’s all a blur since it’s been going on for so long. before i even knew i had a problem (but that’s another story lmao)

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I don't even have room for snacks and I don't understand how others can.

I'm at a point in my life where I'm REALLY ready to leave my ED behind. You know when you really start thinking ""I'm SO done with this""? Yeah, that's the point I'm at. But the fear of gaining weight is just so strong. Before my ED, I used to maintain a normal BMI effortlessly; my hunger cues were on point, and I had no notion about calories at all. 

But now, looking back, I know I used to eat meals that right now would feel restrictive, because back then my hunger cues were actually those of a normal fucking person. I'm at my pre ED weight right now, so it's not like I need to gain weight, but I'm still hungry all the time and I'm still thinking about food all the time. I eat three meals a day that amount to pretty much what I need to eat on a daily basis, and in fact I'm not losing weight. But it literally just feels like in my deepest relapses, just at a higher weight. 

If I want a snack, I need to reduce one of the meals in order to make room for it. If I have a higher calorie dinner, my body won't just compensate automatically by making me less hungry the next day; I'll have to consciously reduce my portions. I cannot have desserts unless I cut something out of other meals. Right now I just had breakfast - a solid, substantial breakfast with all the necessary nutrients - and I'm HUNGRIER than before. Why bother having meals at all then?

It's incredibly frustrating. I will never recover with these meals. Ever. I will have to restrict and think about food for the rest of my freaking life. And I don't want that but I also don't know the alternative, except gaining weight forever.

Obviously dietitians and therapists don't help, in fact they never did. Always stating that these meals should satiate me so it's obviously all MeNtAl. 

Which is why I'm starting to slowly realize that I will never recover. And it's so depressing because it's not like I need my ED or anything. I don't need it, I don't want it, it doesn't make me happy, it doesn't help me, if I could just trust my body and eat whatever I want without thinking about it (like I used to do before the onset of the illness) I would recover right now. Many people say they'll never recover because they cannot let go of their coping mechanism, or control or whatever, but I can. It's not about that, for me.

But I still can't recover. I'm broken. My hunger cues are broken and I'll never be able to fix them. And honestly, I'm not sure that I'll able to live this life much longer.

Yeah, that&amp;#39;s the point I&amp;#39;m at. But the fear of gaining weight is just so strong.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I see that most people recover by following a meal plan, gaining weight slowly, gradually opening up to new foods.

And then there's me, who every time that tries recovery ends up eating ALL THE FOOD ALL THE TIME and gains so much weight. I've been in recovery since Christmas, making use of the holidays to allow myself to eat more, and I told myself that I would follow a 3 meals 3 snacks meal plan BUT also give myself permission to eat more snacks if I wanted them...but I just eat all the time instead. I wanted to gain weight slowly but I gained so much it's almost unbelievable.

I met the criteria for clinically severe Anorexia on the 24th of December, and now I'm weight restored. I went from severely underweight to normal BMI in 2 weeks. It's like every time I try recovery and try a normal meal plan my body takes over and goes ""lol no, you're gonna eat all the food and you're gonna do it NOW"". I'll have a normal breakfast and then just a couple hours later I'll be raiding the pantry. Like today I had a very substantial breakfast with scrambled eggs on buttered toast and a piece of fruit, yet less than 1 hour later I went back and had loads of chocolate, more fruit, ham, a few pieces of candy, some bread with pb, and even had some butter plain. Now I've eaten more than my meal plan for the day, and it's not even lunchtime - my brain is now screaming at me to skip lunch and/or purge but I cannot bring myself to do either of these things.

I'm trying my best to avoid freaking out and to convince myself that it's not a binge and it's okay and I can still eat my meals and carry on with my day...but it's so hard when the only thing you see is you're packing on the pounds and just spend your whole day eating and eating and eating.

Plus, as an adult, eating like a person with Anorexia is embarrassing enough, but eating like a 15 year old highly active male teenager is even worse. I just want it to be over already.


I feel like a complete pig and I've stopped following recovery material because all those people who recover ""the right way"" trigger me so much. They're gonna recover in a skinny body and I won't because I'll never be able to stop eating, I can no longer control myself.

&lt;p&gt;Plus, as an adult, eating like a person with Anorexia is embarrassing enough, but eating like a 15 year old highly active male teenager is even worse. I just want it to be over already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a complete pig and I&amp;#39;ve stopped following recovery material because all those people who recover &amp;quot;the right way&amp;quot; trigger me so much. They&amp;#39;re gonna recover in a skinny body and I won&amp;#39;t because I&amp;#39;ll never be able to stop eating, I can no longer control myself. I was never overweight in my life but I feel it&amp;#39;s just gonna be my destiny because I&amp;#39;m just not able to apply any moderation to my eating.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"This post is part rant, part seeking advice. NSFW tag just in case. 

My history with ED is something I've kept a secret to a lot of people in my life, including some of my best friends. To be honest, being at my age (26) and still struggling with image and my ED makes me very ashamed. It's embarrassing to cry over food, restrict, binge, exercise excessively, and lose and gain the same 10 pounds over and over. I don't *look* like someone who has struggled with anorexia - maybe a little on the smaller side, but not clinically underweight. 

But I'm not over chasing the dragon, not yet. I keep thinking I can live the life I want and maintain the weight I want. I know this is taboo and unhealthy to say out loud, but I just want to be honest about it somewhere. I don't know if I want to give up my ED.

My friend has just invited me to take boudoir photos with them, and this isn't the first time someone has asked me about this. I love the idea of a boudoir photoshoot, I love fashion and lingerie and body positivity, but it scares the absolute shit out of me. I have a very difficult relationship with my image and body. I hate any and all photographs. It took so much nerve to do my damn engagement photo shoots. In a perfect world, I'd take some sexy pictures and boom, I'd feel great about myself, but I doubt that will happen. 

I love that people freely express themselves and their sexuality, and I think that's important. But I feel so infantile and stupid for being so hung up on my body and am worried people judge me for my insecurity. Maybe I'm not expressing this the most eloquent or PC way, so I hope this is not triggering to read.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"This isn't 100% about my eating disorder, but it's related. I've been working on recovery the last 3 years and I've made a lot of progress, but I also feel like that has revealed how my problems go deeper than my ED.

I don't know how to explain it exactly, but basically I'm a pretty intense person. I have intense emotions, usually in phases of 2-4 days, sometimes longer or shorter. If nothing's holding me back, I'll keep myself busy to the point of exhaustion which kinda makes me feel better, but isn't sustainable. I used to think this was linked to my ED, but now I don't care as much about weight/food and the rest is still there.

What's making me want to seek help is, the effect on my relationship. I try to be a good partner, but I know my emotions still come through and I can be difficult. Sometimes I lose perspective, which leads to fights. My coping mechanisms (ED, staying super busy) aren't good for the relationship obviously, which I can control but it's always a battle.

Previously, I was on medication on-and-off for several years (citalopram aka celexa). It definitely leveled me out and actually helped address my ED symptoms a LOT. But it also made me sluggish and tired all the time, basically sedated. I didn't feel like myself. I was mostly just sleeping when I should have been exploring life and making friendships. I know that's not the only option and the dose can also be adjusted, but I'm scared of going through that again. Last time I tried it, I remember having thoughts like ""Fuck it, life is intense, I'm an intense person, and it's okay to live an intense life.""

I saw a therapist for six months recently, I came to her wanting to talk about other things but we wound up talking about my mood symptoms too. She said I showed some signs of a possible mood disorder but it wasn't 100% clear, and recommended I bring this up with my doctor if I ever get concerned in the future. So I guess I'm concerned. But also scared to ask my doctor because I don't know what will happen.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've had a long-term psychologist for help with trauma and depression the past couple of years, and he's highly qualified, and we have a good bond. He's also though a 72 year old man and the things he says to me wrt my eating disorder are at best unhelpful, if we didn't have a close relationship then I would think he sounds ignorant. I \*REALLY\* want to see a specifically eating disorder counselor biweekly for focused, action oriented plans on managing my bulimia. There's someone in particular accepting patients I want to see.

dae find that seeing the scale go down sets them back almost- like i get that rush of euphoria for a moment but then am thinking like 'oh, i still managed too loose weight ever after i ate x,y&amp;z' or 'if i still lost after eats at this time or after overeating then i guess i don't need too consciously restrict anymore as much'. and then i gain it back in a week or so get disgusted and sad and start the cycle again with the same 5lbs.
 i am absolutely sick of it. 

i feel so invalid hearing eds (specifically restrictive ones) where seeing the number go lower promotes them restricting further. i sometimes just tend too see it as permission too eat freer as long as my weight stays below the 'uw' section on the bmi chart.

i love cooking and hate too admit it but always cook our foods separate when they ask too eat the same so i can sabotage it with higher cals. i just feel so stressed and out of control because she bought things id never buy such as vegan cheese because of how ive read its made etc so im even more worried too eat it. 

i just need too know that even though it was not planned if i eat any of it its okay and doesn't make me invalid or weak because i didn't choose and buy it. idel what im getting at here im just stressed and annoyed theres all this bloody vegan food i will have too find a way too use up because now i feel bad shes spent money on it.

I’ve been on a restrict/binge cycle for years. I’ll eat a very little amount for days then gorge myself for a couple days after my restriction period comes to an end. For some reason, however, when I DO binge, I always feel the need to add DISGUSTING (and I mean truly disgusting) amounts of high caloric/high fat “ingredients” to whatever I’m preparing. 
For example, say it’s a day I decide I am eating whatever tf I want. I will go to McDonald’s and order burgers/junior chickens. I will then ask for extra mayonnaise with said items. I will THEN add my own mayo (yes I’ll bring a mayo container with me in my car) and add EVEN MORE plus I’ll even add extra salt/hell I’ve even brought extra Kraft single slices with me to add to my food. Another example. I was making spaghetti for dinner tonight (I’ve been restricting for three days prior to today) and I was trying to make it a normal spaghetti recipe. But for whatever reason I compulsively added a HUGE slab of butter to the pasta sauce. Also a week ago I had tacos for dinner and added more sour cream/cheese than the taco shell could hold and I still didn’t think it was enough. My boyfriend thinks I’m disgusting (it is though, the amount of fatty toppings I add to food don’t even make sense) WHY am I like this? My parents cooked yummy, healthy (ish) dinners growing up all my life. Why don’t feel this weird compulsion to make any food that I eat on my “binge” days soooooo much more unhealthy than they need to be? The things I do to my food DONT EVEN IMPROVE THE TASTE. they make it worse. But it’s as if I crave fat/salt to the extent that even those on “my 600 pound life” would probably think I’m weird. Whenever I eat food that someone else prepares for me (homemade, something I don’t eat often at a restaurant, etc) I always try to remind myself how good it tastes and why I don’t need to add absurd amounts of butter/oil/mayo/salt to every thing I eat when I’m binging. The only reason I’m not morbidly obese/super unhealthy is because of how much restriction I do in between these binge periods. Does anyone relate to this?


Edit*

More examples from the top of my head:

Making sandwiches for my boyfriend and myself. I will make his normally and make mine with 3x the amount of butter/mayo than his (it’s disgusting. I literally don’t even like how it tastes this way.) and I’ll be super secretive about it.  (Wtf!)

Any time I follow a recipe, if it calls for oil/butter I will automatically add at least double the recommended amount. (Same with salt)

I’ll add butter to foods that don’t even require it what so ever. (Any kind of soup, ramen/instant noodles, literally anything) and will seriously not eat it if I don’t have something fatty to sneak in. 

One time I wanted to get a sub from Subway. I then didn’t end up getting it because I realized I was out of mayo at home and didn’t want to embarrass myself with asking for 4x the normal amount of mayo. Embarrassing. I know.

2 weeks ago i was doing okay. eating alot more feeling
ok about it &amp; maintaining. although i had no plan too
continue this i was accepting how i currently behaved
and my mindset for the moment

christmas was crap lol got abit worse &amp; urge too restrict was massive. ive not been alone at all for about a week now &amp; staying at my friends and i feel so overwhelmed. staying at my friends has allowed me too restrict alot for the first time in 3 weeks or a month maybe and i feel like its just chucked me back into the deep end. i ate some toast this morning and havent felt that uncomfortable about eating food in ages. like 2 weeks ago that probs would have been ok but now its too stressful and since im not home and cant weigh food etc im using more behaviours too compensate. 

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :(

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Last night my husband and I attended a Webinar by my therapist and he was introduced as someone who deals with ""severe"" mental health issues.

My husband and I were laughing because we were like, but he's treating me! That's hilarious. 

This morning I realised, wait, eighteen years disordered *is* severe. That's like two-thirds of my life. My therapist told me my condition is severe. My aunt who has seen me through the depths of my illness said it is severe, and that I was just in denial.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"Does anyone else have very bad appetite issues?
I have Anorexia Nervosa, about ten years and I am twenty-two. I am very underweight but normally can eat a good amount and maintain it. Lately not so much though. 

Lately, most foods have been sounding very unappetizing and disgusting- even foods that I really enjoy. I feel very hungry, yet too weak physically to keep a lot of food down. I feel full so quickly than immediately feel exhausted right after, and even when hungry, so many foods and smells seem so unappetizing. 

For example, I've recently ONLY been craving fatty cuts of meats like red meat, fried meats, or starches with a lot of fat like mashed potatoes or pasta. Textures have been very nauseating unless very, very fatty or very crispy. The smell of food lingering makes me so sick that I sometimes throw up. And every-time I eat I feel like I can just lay in bed and nap. I try to stay very hydrated with Gatorade Zeroes and Pellegrino water all day.

I have Anorexia Nervosa, about ten years and I am twenty-two. I am very underweight but normally can eat a good amount and maintain it. Lately not so much though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, most foods have been sounding very unappetizing and disgusting- even foods that I really enjoy. I feel very hungry, yet too weak physically to keep a lot of food down. I feel full so quickly than immediately feel exhausted right after, and even when hungry, so many foods and smells seem so unappetizing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I&amp;#39;ve recently ONLY been craving fatty cuts of meats like red meat, fried meats, or starches with a lot of fat like mashed potatoes or pasta. Textures have been very nauseating unless very, very fatty or very crispy. The smell of food lingering makes me so sick that I sometimes throw up. And every-time I eat I feel like I can just lay in bed and nap. I try to stay very hydrated with Gatorade Zeroes and Pellegrino water all day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up very late in the day and basically am always fatigued. The loss of appetite is very frustrating. Nothing satisfies me literally besides very salty, fatty meat. Otherwise, I feel unsatisfied which is so unrealistic and exhausting. I do not know what to do or what is wrong with me- let alone if anyone else experiences this.&lt;/p&gt;

,EdAnonymousAdults,"CW: a few specifics about dietary restrictions (for medical reasons), mention of weight loss (no numbers)

Sorry in advance that this is a pretty long read. I don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but I figured some of you might be able to relate.

I am on the Low-FODMAP diet, which is a super rigid, restrictive, seemingly nonsensical diet. I'm not on it by choice -- back in June my doctor and dietitian (who don't specialize in treating ED patients) advised me to start it because my IBS symptoms were out of control and running my life. I also have gastroparesis, but I don't think this diet does anything for that (there are a few similarities to the GP diet, but they function in different ways to minimize symptoms). 

Breaking the diet and eating even a small amount of one of the ""oh-no-nos"" can render me bed-bound, or stuck on the toilet, or both, for days. When I first started the diet, I was doing pretty good with my Ed -- I was almost done with PHP for depression, which was super helpful, and my team also knew to check in occasionally about my Ed. My weight was healthy and stable, and with 8 weeks of PHP under my belt, I felt like the veil of depression was finally starting to lift.

Within a month, I unintentionally lost xx lbs because of the restrictive nature and complexity of the diet. All of my disordered eating thoughts, and many of my old behaviors, came back. Because I was sick a lot of the time, and on medical leave from work, it was easy to isolate myself/fuel my Ed. I live with my SO, but he's pretty oblivious. Eventually, when I started showing signs of malnutrition, I told him how much weight I had lost, and he said he honestly hadn't noticed..I mean come on guy, I have body dysmorphia and even *I* could look in the mirror and see the changes in my appearance.

Somehow I managed to keep this shit up until around November, when my SO said that if I didn't get help (for this and depression, which didn't take long to come back), he might end our relationship. So I've been on the wait list for an IP/res program for 8+weeks now...but I had to change insurance when I got fired from my job, and there is a big chance they won't accept out of state Medicaid (haven't been able to talk to the program coordinator about this yet).

So there's the back story...now here comes A Christmas Story:

I went to a good old fashioned Friendsmas on Thursday. I brought my own little boring ass dish for myself, but naturally, other friends brought food that actually looked good. I quizzed a couple of my friends about ingredients, and had a *small* amount of spicy potato curry, even though I know it was made with onion and garlic (major oh-no-nos). Like my SO said, ""a small amount won't kill ya""...right? 

Woke up the next morning feeling really nauseous. My friend, the host, was making pancakes and offered me one. I thought it might help with the nausea if I ate one dry, so I ate half a pancake before I realized ""oh shit I can't eat these"" (gluten and dairy). And then I realized the beer we had been drinking the night before was infused with grapefruit (another oh-no-no). Don't even get me started on beer -- I'm not supposed to have any, but I've always just said fuck it and drank it anyways, and only have issues if I really overdo it.

I drove home and spent the afternoon filling our toilet with ass piss. I wasn't able to spend Christmas Eve with my SO and his stepdad like we had planned. I spent my evening surfing Reddit and binge-watching Shrill.

I am still sick today, so I had to call my parents and tell them I won't be coming to Christmas at their house. They were pissed, because I knowingly consumed things that have the potential to make me sick, *and* they made an entire Christmas meal that caters to my ridiculous dietary restrictions. I'm very sad I won't get to see them, but even more so my nephew and his parents -- due to my SIL being very pregnant, covid, and all my health issues, it's been months since I saw them last. 

After I hung up the phone with them I called my SO and just cried for a while about how much I hate my body, and this diet, and how my stomach issues have made my world so small over the past year. He was sympathetic I guess, until I asked him what time he's coming home later. He said that he's not, he's staying at his mom's house. She only lives 20 minutes away. He used the excuse of having to work tomorrow, but I'm 100% sure he's just crashing there because he's gonna be up late getting wine-drunk with his mom.

I quickly ended the call because I knew I was about to snap off and say something mean. Sooo instead of saying it to his face, I texted him, like a mature, grown-ass adult! It was nothing attacking his character or him as a person (re: not really that mean)...basically, I accused him of not giving a shit that I'm spending the entirety of Christmas alone. He texted back ""what the fuck? You knew this was my plan"" (no I did not actually), and that's it. No acknowledgement of my frustration, my loneliness...actually caring about seeing him (and my family too obviously) for Christmas.

I want to be done. I don't want to be on this diet anymore...I don't want to go to treatment again after 8 years of staying healthy enough not to need it...I don't want my life to be dictated by digestive issues...I don't want my SO to just flippantly write me off as acting crazy whenever I bring up something that is bothering me (usually I'm more mature than today). I don't want to be manipulated by him to go to treatment...everything about our relationship is always on his terms.

Anyway, I'm sorry this got so long, I just had to get it out somewhere. It kind of jumps all over the place, but long story short: my eating disorder and crippling depression are back. Combine those two things with my chronic digestive issues and little to no social support, and I don't know how much longer I'll last.

Merry Christmas, everyone...I hope you are doing whatever makes you happy today

I quizzed a couple of my friends about ingredients, and had a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; amount of spicy potato curry, even though I know it was made with onion and garlic (major oh-no-nos). Like my SO said, &amp;quot;a small amount won&amp;#39;t kill ya&amp;quot;...right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up the next morning feeling really nauseous. My friend, the host, was making pancakes and offered me one. I thought it might help with the nausea if I ate one dry, so I ate half a pancake before I realized &amp;quot;oh shit I can&amp;#39;t eat these&amp;quot; (gluten and dairy). And then I realized the beer we had been drinking the night before was infused with grapefruit (another oh-no-no). Don&amp;#39;t even get me started on beer -- I&amp;#39;m not supposed to have any, but I&amp;#39;ve always just said fuck it and drank it anyways, and only have issues if I really overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove home and spent the afternoon filling our toilet with ass piss. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to spend Christmas Eve with my SO and his stepdad like we had planned. I spent my evening surfing Reddit and binge-watching Shrill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still sick today, so I had to call my parents and tell them I won&amp;#39;t be coming to Christmas at their house. They were pissed, because I knowingly consumed things that have the potential to make me sick, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they made an entire Christmas meal that caters to my ridiculous dietary restrictions. I&amp;#39;m very sad I won&amp;#39;t get to see them, but even more so my nephew and his parents -- due to my SIL being very pregnant, covid, and all my health issues, it&amp;#39;s been months since I saw them last. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I hung up the phone with them I called my SO and just cried for a while about how much I hate my body, and this diet, and how my stomach issues have made my world so small over the past year. He was sympathetic I guess, until I asked him what time he&amp;#39;s coming home later. He said that he&amp;#39;s not, he&amp;#39;s staying at his mom&amp;#39;s house. She only lives 20 minutes away. He used the excuse of having to work tomorrow, but I&amp;#39;m 100% sure he&amp;#39;s just crashing there because he&amp;#39;s gonna be up late getting wine-drunk with his mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly ended the call because I knew I was about to snap off and say something mean. Sooo instead of saying it to his face, I texted him, like a mature, grown-ass adult! It was nothing attacking his character or him as a person (re: not really that mean)...basically, I accused him of not giving a shit that I&amp;#39;m spending the entirety of Christmas alone. He texted back &amp;quot;what the fuck? You knew this was my plan&amp;quot; (no I did not actually), and that&amp;#39;s it. No acknowledgement of my frustration, my loneliness...actually caring about seeing him (and my family too obviously) for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be done. I don&amp;#39;t want to be on this diet anymore...I don&amp;#39;t want to go to treatment again after 8 years of staying healthy enough not to need it...I don&amp;#39;t want my life to be dictated by digestive issues...I don&amp;#39;t want my SO to just flippantly write me off as acting crazy whenever I bring up something that is bothering me (usually I&amp;#39;m more mature than today). I don&amp;#39;t want to be manipulated by him to go to treatment...everything about our relationship is always on his terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m sorry this got so long, I just had to get it out somewhere. It kind of jumps all over the place, but long story short: my eating disorder and crippling depression are back. Combine those two things with my chronic digestive issues and little to no social support, and I don&amp;#39;t know how much longer I&amp;#39;ll last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas, everyone...I hope you are doing whatever makes you happy today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: typo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days or weeks are fine, but some periods are just painful. Right now I can barely stand for 5-10 minutes and then I can feel my legs starting to vibrate and soon afterwards I have to lie down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were decorating the tree and my energylevel just dipped. My legs started hurting, my eyes were burning and I got so tired. I had to lie down on the sofa and couldn&amp;#39;t move or talk, just grunt. I started to tear up from the pain while my mother was annoyed because I wouldn&amp;#39;t help her out. &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t you just help me? :&amp;#39;o&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hold on&amp;quot; was all I got out.&lt;/p&gt;

been going through a peroid of eating kinda normally and not using as many behaviours for about 3 weeks- a month. makes me feel v uncomfortable and unsafe but im trying too be kind too myself. its not recovery i dont think and ik im just waiting and begging too want too hardcore restrict again. idk what this uncomfortable middle ground is i hate it here.

 i am meeting my best friends who i havent seen in months tonight and part of me rllllly wants too restrict until then but i also want too eat and fuel properly so im not anxious and moody lol. i think mayb its cause theyre the only ppl who know ab my struggles and i feel pressure too *look* the part. stupid ik. but part of me feels guilty for confiding in them w my struggles and then not struggling as much for abit. 

 im just struggling with the motivation and feeling allowed too eat.  no one in my family knows about my ed and i feel so alone too either keep myself accountable or go thru this alone. i just need some support too make the *actual* right decision bcos im so torn.  my brains just split into 2 man i hate this shit.

My two main treatment options, since my bmi will be too low soon for CFD, and Alsana seems sus because of cover ups and very odd reviews, are ERC denver and Laureate. However, they have a rly bit difference in the wait times, and I’m consistently losing weight. Denver is 2-3weeks from 3 days ago, and Laureate is 6 weeks. 

Laureate is way smaller so therefore more personalized, which I think is better for me because I am sensitive (might have ASD) and kind of picky with food, like meat fat and milk and mushrooms and asparagus and citrus desserts. However, if the waitlist is actually 6 weeks long I feel like it would take a really long time to recover from that point because I’ve been low restricting/fasting for a bit now.

I’ve heard some good things of ERC Denver pine, since it is less triggering than Willow, and because Denver is a hub for medicine. However, I’ve also heard that staff can be abusive and it can be like prison/they kick you out if you aren’t doing well apparently ? Unless you’re super low bmi.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"My outpatient ed team kept blocking me from taking testosterone. They said it would make me bloat and gain weight, and I was already ""too heavy."" I wasn't having health issues due to my weight, I just have a larger body. They said I had to embrace my destiny and reality as a woman, date men, have kids, and stop avoiding my responsibilities. 

I fired them all, went to planned parenthood, and started on t in August. I also put together a new ed outpatient team.

This is the first week I haven't purged. Since 2011. Yes I've been binging and purging on a daily basis for over a decade.

I finally feel like it's okay to eat. If my body changes, it's ok, I will still have drs that respect my identity. They are on my side and their goals are mine.

My body has changed some in fact. I was not trying, but lost some weight from the testosterone. I stopped weighing myself so I didn't even know, until I went to the Dr's recently.

Most of the ocd worrying and obsessive thoughts are gone. I did have a melt down a few weeks ago when I realized my shoulders got bigger and my waist got smaller, and none of my work shirts fit anymore. But it was a change that I was okay with and a fixable problem. I let out the seams in the shirts.

Anyway I was told a few years ago that I really would not be able to recover from the Ed without gender affirming care. Now I see what they meant. I couldn't trust my team until I knew that they weren't forcing me to lose weight, so I'd be more feminized/gender conforming.

There is this colleague I have, same faculty, a middle aged man whose background is not related at all to med sci. He keeps making comments about my size. At this point I am getting upset. 

First, he was talking about nutrition and IF, gestured at my body and commented that I am clearly good at fasting. I ignored him. Second, we were sharing stories about students in our labs, and I spoke about how a chemical I work with can have a side effect of hunger (which freaks students out when they are looking at embalmed bodies). He again gestured at my body and told me, obviously I do not experience that side effect. I ignored him. 

The third time was after I carried a very heavy box of chemicals up to his lab. By the time I got there I was visibly suffering from the trip. He said “you need to eat more, you need to gain weight, you are very skinny”. I dismissed this so he repeated himself. I changed the topic to the chemicals and he said “okay fine, we won’t talk about your personal issues”. I ignored him. 

This week, we were in my lab and my hands were gross colours because it is extremely cold in there. He pointed this out, then told me it’s because I have no fat, and must have poor circulation because I’m too thin. I ignored him. Later this day we had to weigh equipment and he said “that’s got to be close to you”. I didn’t respond. A moment later he *literally guessed my weight*. He said that I can’t weigh much, then “what do you weigh? About Xkg?” I said “it’s not a good idea to guess what people weigh” and he laughed it off. (He got my weight correct, thankfully). After he left, I cried in my office. 

I was crying because of the attention to my size and body. The fact that my weight is being thought about. His previous comment about my “personal issues” also made me anxious that he may have said something to other colleagues about me. One comment was made at a social event, which was hard enough, and we have another coming up this week (I looked at the menu, I don’t want to do it 😭).

Let's start with the obvious. I feel so alone. I just took a stupid selfie and captioned it stating ""Hi everyone I'm actually struggling hard atm and where I can't battle it with weed anymore I'm taking a double dose of prescription opiods"" and I went to post it live to my ig then I narrowed down to close friends then I narrowed down to just this one really close friend and then I just didnt send it at all. 

I wasn't lying and the only reason I was that open is cuz I'm feeling loose and also a fair bit friendly with the old jack Daniels. 

But I didn't send it. I can't share that. Wtf how could I be that open with anyone?? I couldn't. I wouldn't. They don't need the burden of knowing how awful I feel. Deleted. Removed. No need to act like I'd ever share that.

I think maybe I did to my friend, deleted straight away ofc but she got a notif and replied saying hey girl u okay? Haaaah.oooop. here we are here we are. 

Drunk and stoned and I've been sad for so long and it's all made worse by the fact I won't fucking feed myself. 

Did you know not eating makes your serotonin go low? Like scientifically low? Like actually being hangry and angry and low? 

Just take my word for it. It's a bit of a bitch. If I could go back and do all of this would I ever do it? ""Because skinny""? Because maybe having control and because maybe feeling like I can do anything at all. 

Can you do anything though? 

Trapped and unsure and insecure and alone and lonely and so sad and sad all the time and hungry and hurting and empty feeling but so heavy and full and heavy and fat and gross and disgusting but light if you do this for long and airy and ow why does my side hurt and ow what was that noise was that gas or a rumble or ow ugh would water help 

Is it worth it?

i was planning too eat dinner and my food for day when me and my brother had a huge argument &amp; now im back too wanting too restrict cause im down again. 
on top of that he told me hed not eaten anything yet when i asked him which made me even more guilty bcos id had bfast AND lunch already which i spent hrs trying too justify. 

why is this shit so so hard. i feel so lonely but im also scared af ill continue eating this way into the new yr.

tried abit, hid rest in bag. 
changed mind &amp; ended up bloody eating it without trying too think too much.

like i just wish i hadnt ate it. 

it tasted good and its nice too not miss out again but its just so uncomfortable and i feel guilty about it my stomach feels warm and uncomfortable af.

It&amp;#39;s a sign of my progress. i wont mention my numbers here for fear of being deleted, but it&amp;#39;s substantial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to hijack my own thread, but this is related so i&amp;#39;ll add it here. Do you have a chest/other parts[if you know, you know] that deflated and sank? Does it make you feel like no one of your preferred sexual partner gender could find you attractive? Do you have trouble being naked in front of your s/o because you feel like there&amp;#39;s no way they could want to look at you? How has it affected that part of your life? It&amp;#39;s really, really hard for me. i can&amp;#39;t help but think my body is disgusting. my s/o has no problem with the way i look. He tells me all day every day that i&amp;#39;m beautiful. He loved me at my highest weight and he loves me now at my lowest. He hates what this illness has done to my mental state, but to him i&amp;#39;m still physically attractive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours &amp; thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it.

,EdAnonymousAdults,"I've been following HeAlThY MeAl pLaNs with BaLaNcEd sTrUcTuReD pOrTiOnS for years now. And I used to eat very normally before the onset of my illness. I am perfectly aware of what normal eating looks like. I could draw a meal plan on the spot myself and prescribe it to others. I could write a book on normal, healthy, balanced, structured meals.

Problem is, it does f*ck all for curing my mind - it only exacerbates my obsessive tendencies around food AND it never satisfies me on top of that. It always feels like restriction. At least with *my* restriction I can daydream of the day where I FINALLY will be able to eat EVERYTHING I want. Following ""structured meal plans"" just feels like misery, all the time, forever.

My therapist actually said to me that I will never be able to go back to what I was pre-ED because that intuitiveness around food is gone forever, so at this point I should just follow a meal plan so that at least I don't die. And when he said that, I cried. I felt so lost and hopeless.

And I'm so frustrated that no one seems to understand. Meal plans seem to be the golden treatment and if you're not okay with them then everyone treats you like you're actually refusing meal plans because you have some other deep rooted psychological issue, like you're scared of giving up control, you're scared of feeling full or whatever, and in reality meal plans *do* satisfy you but you wanna use binges to fill your inner emptiness...after years of this bullshit I just roll my eyes and yawn.
