"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,180,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",circinia,1011,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tc5fpx/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/
"When it happens after 30yo, nobody gives a shit when you're life is falling apart","Everyday I feel lower, everyday the things i thought were secure slip further away. I've never spoken to anybody about depression, but now that I've tried to reach out to friends, I realize I may need professional help.

Job stress is compiling to the point I want to quit but can't because its a better paying job than anything near me, and I need the money. 10 year relationship is coming to a ugly end, found out she cheated, and I suspect its ongoing. Were going to couples therapy, but it really feels like each day my SO grows colder and colder. Ive never felt so alone in my own home.

I've tried to reach out to friends, not emotionally dump on them, but let them know how I've been feeling. And it really just turns into ""oh man... thats crazy, (insert what they're going through)"". The first time that happened I just focused on them, let them vent. I thought I would feel better being there for a friend. But when it happened with a close friend a week later, I was honest. ""Hey, I really could use an ear right now."" And he just sighed and said, ""bitches lie and cheat. Leave her and save your money""

its so fucking crazy to me that people actually want to be alive,"im looking at my parents rn, they work their ass off all day for all week, working a shitty job that doesnt pay good to get home, eat shit food, sleep and repeat it. and theyve never had the thought that life might not be worth the effort, or that its all pointless. but i guess theyre 'normal', if u add mental illness into the mix and try to make a normal person work all day all week for shitty pay from a shitty job, who wouldnt kill themself? its fucking insane to me that more people in this position arent considering it, like how the fuck is it worth it? its so much work to go to a job all day and interact and use energy to help people and do repetetive tasks all day every day just to barely earn enough money to survive, it simply isnt worth it for me, id really rather be dead. i mean is it that bad a decision? staying alive has literally no positive points for me, its just work, and sleep and in the little free time i have, i get high which is only temporary. no friends, avpd so i cant make any friends and obviously not a fucking girlfriend, nothing is fun, how do normal people do it? are they just so stupid they never consider how much their life sucks? maybe they just dont mind working? maybe their life is actually worth the effort, they dont mind their job as they have lots of reasons to keep going, things to work towards etc. i dont know but how the fuck arent more people freaking out about this, i worked for like 2 days and i already felt suffocated, overwhelmed, on the verge of a panic attack just from being there, its too mcuh knowing i have to do this for bascially the rest of my life, that im on break and still have 8 hours of straight work to go. i really think id rather be dead than just keep putting myself through taht and im fucking baffled at how no one else seems to mind this, i know im not exactly normal and cant relate to the average person but even so, i dont know how they can work even part time, never mind full time and still want to be alive. i think normal people, non mentally ill people are basically a different species at this point. might as well be with how different we are, like trying to compare a lion to a cat. maybe the same thign but very different types",DeadFishInMyAss,14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh7lbj/its_so_fucking_crazy_to_me_that_people_actually/

"Turned my life around, depression didn't go away. What's the fucking point then?","After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help. Tired of having to push myself to keep existing, when all I get in return is feeling sad and lonely. I'm tired of suddenly finding myself a few years older and realising I have no new happy memories.

is depression making me less intelligent?,"I've been struggling with this for months.. i just feel like i am slowly losing braincells. I space out a lot, i am unable to focus on anything.

I have no opinions anymore, no personality, really. 
I used to be so much smarter. I used to read a lot, now i can barely read a sentence without losing focus. I used to be very opinionated, now i just have no energy to discuss stuff with people.

my psychiatrist called me retarded,"I was just telling her my problems, abt how my sister takes advantage of me, because my mom is sick and I care for my mom.

I just can't leave my mom , when she is dying. I told my sister many times to help around the house. 

My psychiatrist said, if ur telling her and she is not doing it, then ur not getting results, what your doing is not working, some people might call you retarded.

I cant force my sister,  to do stuff she is an adult. I already told my sister I can't clean after you, you don't contribute anything and asked her to leave.

My mom has cancers , so I don't want to create problems for my mom, I don't want her to worry. 

I am only alive for my mom sake. My depression is not caused by my sister. She jusy makes it worse. 

I cant even get out of bed, but for my mom sake I get up , cook, clean and do everything.

Nothing gets better.,"I was very depressed growing up in a small town, I moved across the country to a big city, and then the suburbs. All the people and traffic just make me anxious and I never want to leave my apartment. Ive lived here for about 10 years now and haven't gotten used to it. I have a significant other that I've been with for about 6 years now, who would never move back to my hometown with me.
I don't know what to do anymore. I've worked dead end kitchen jobs for about 16ish years and I'm afraid I'll never be able to do anything that I like. 
I want to tattoo but I highly doubt that I'm a good enough artist to do so. Plus my depressing keeps me feeling so tired all the time, finding motivation is hard. 
I feel terrible for leaving my single mom on the other side of the country by herself, and I would feel terrible for leaving my significant other by going back. I tend to make terrible impulsive decisions.

I had not the best childhood I was babied and over protected by my mom(she's a lot better now about it), hated and bullied by my older brother cause I took up most of moms attention (our relationship is fine now we talked it out years ago), I had a shit ton of the weirdest illnesses that had me out of school all the time, I was bullied all through school by staff and students until it made me suicidal in high school and I switched to online homeschooling which was fine until covid happened as I was about to graduate and the influx of new students caused the servers to ""crash and reboot causing some local drives data to be lost"" which reset my entire last year and I just dropped out, I didn't have any relationships through all that either, I never had a job because of social anxiety before and now my it's my back hurting if I stand for more than a minuet, I ate for comfort as a kid and through my teens causing me to gain a lot of weight (I'm losing it now tho I'm 350lbs. 60lbs+ lost since the beginning of the year), ever since I was born I've had eczema and it only got worse with age so much so at one point I had super itchy infected spots on my ankle that had exposed muscle and to this day have psoriasis like scales below my knee to my ankle.

I don’t have the strength to end my life for only one reason and that is my religion. I am not scared to leave my family and friends behind because I know that it would not impact them that much since I have been keeping a distance from them for quite a time. 

Everyday I feel worse than the day before, I am certain that there is no future for me and it brings me so much pain that I still have to live my life even if I don’t want to. I have tried many times to make my life better but  I quickly become demotivated if I see no progress in my mental state. 

My family and friends don’t know that I am experiencing this. I do not have the heart or courage to tell them this because I feel like that will only make them feel bad or that they won’t truly care. There is only one person who I trust to talk to about this but I even distanced myself from him even though he always cared. 

I just want it to end so that I can no longer worry about anything, I just want to close my eyes and never experience this hellish life. I don’t want to suffer anymore and drown in my thoughts. I just want it to be quiet like when I am sleeping but then forever. 

What lead me to this does not come from a single moment. It’s from all my pain over the years which I have been building up and storing in myself instead of dealing with it.

Angry before depressive episode,"I’m currently on my 7th depressive episode over the last 7 years (it lasts 6-8 months). Massive anxiety, inability to make decisions, weeping spells, suicidal thoughts. I’ve quit my job 3 times because of how debilitating it is mentally.

As time passes, I become decisive and know exactly what I want and don’t want. I excel quickly at anything I try. At times, I get angry and judgmental, and have an inflated sense of self. Things need to be done, no excuses. Very black and white.

I opened up to my closest friend after a lot of hesitation and I was first and foremost met with bullshit. Not a thought of empathy, nothing of that sort. Instead they said that if they had been evaluated they would have scored so much higher than me. What kind of answer is that? What has to go through a persons brain to think this is the best thing to say in a situation like this? 

Coming back to the title of the post, this person has shown many times that they want to have depression. Keep in mind, not wishing to receive a formal diagnosis for a problem that they may have, but actual desire to have a mental illness. It’s hard to express through a post, but irl their behavior makes it obvious that they think being sad sometimes = depression. And to top it off they keep making jokes calling their sadness ‘depression’ around me, just like people who say they are OCD when they are just organized. 

Do people ever think before talking? I’m not even expecting empathy, but damn I’ll definitely never talk to anyone about my depression ever again",periplaneta-f,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/whcjxg/the_only_friend_who_knows_about_my_depression/

Behavior health Inpatient. I'm not ok.,"My s/o expressed suicidal thoughts and more to me and we called his doctor who told us to go to the ER to be evaluated. This is after extensive questioning about the options he has. He has been impatient twice in his life years ago and it was a horrible experience for him i.e they didn't care and treated him horribly. I asked many different docs/nurses over the phone what to expect so he felt he had some control and wouldn't feel like a 'prisoner'. No one could give us definitive answers. Finally he spoke to his doctor and I guess she convinced him to go and basically yelled at me to drive him there immediately even though I made it clear he has no intent to harm himself right now. But since he was ok going, we went. He expressed how he didn't want to be dropped off (by me) which I assured him I wasn't. And that's exactly what's happening right now. He checked in, they checked him for weapons, then took him from me without telling us anything. Telling me to go wait in waiting room. When I asked when I can go back there they said to basically go home or if I want I can wait for him to call me but I can't see him. They made me take his phone from him. So ok hospital phone. But this all happened so quickly we didn't even have a chance to say goodbye because we didn't know what was happening. I know this sounds like the norm in a way, but for him this is EXACTLY what he didn't want to happen. We were told we could talk to the docs together to form a plan. THIS could ACTUALLY make him much worse. I feel like shit 'doing this to him' I hope he doesn't think I 'planned this'. Is there anything I can do? All we said to the front desk was very basic not concerning things. I have no one to vent to or ask because he doesn't want anyone knowing. Which I understand. But right now I'm very upset by how this went down. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Either side? Can he say he doesn't want to stay here and they'll let him go?",Emergency_Lab8262,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh9e4v/behavior_health_inpatient_im_not_ok/

Depression has turned me into a bad person,"Maybe i was a bad person to begin with and was too naive to see my actions, i don’t even know anymore. From what i remember, before i became depressed, everyone would tell me how sweet i was and i would find joy in such the smallest things. Now i hate everyone and everything. I used to love spending time with my family, but now whenever they’re around, i completely isolate myself. I self sabotage every relationship i get in, it’s so impossible for me to feel love for someone in that way, all i find is their faults. It all makes sense though, how the hell am i supposed to love someone else when i literally hate myself? I hate going out because i can’t help but compare myself to others. Everyone is prettier then me, their body looks better, their clothes look better, etc. I can’t even pray anymore, my faith is so down the drain…and on top of that, school starts in 10 days and i don’t know if i can mentally handle it. I’m on academic probation because my gpa doesn’t meet requirements and now that’s added stress.

36-year-old unemployed willing to sign a contract,"Dear Internet,

I am a 36-year-old unemployed male living with my 80+ year old Grandmother who still works.

Last year I lost my life savings in a long-con, my stepfather, and divorced my wife. This is not mean’t to be a sob story, just seeking advice.

**I want nothing more in my life** **but to..**

* A) Have my Grandmother live without working and to financially support her fully 
* B) Have a job (remote, but beggars can’t be choosers) 
* C) Rent my own place.

**I have...**

* I have no degree. 
* A long history of contract writing along with experience in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
* A current contract position similar to DoorDash. It's seasonal.

I am not sure how to ask for help here. I contemplated writing this due to the potential backlash but I don’t care anymore, I am just trying.

For awhile now, I’ve been unsure how to apply myself towards junior front-end development jobs or really be anybody that anybody wants. 

I’ve kept applying on and off and had two interviews within the span of 4 years. 

Two years ago I took a $10,000 bootcamp in San Francisco that assured job placement, and I’ve never felt dumber in my life. Apparently, my work was good and I have a portfolio. 

Recently, I was inspired by an old high school friend to keep applying to tech jobs and that I can do something. I have a few coding projects in the pipeline, some previous work to show, but am still piecing together the masterpieces.

**In essence...**

I am wondering if there is anybody I could talk to or have as a mentor to help place me on the right track to get a remote development job. I am willing to sign a legally binding contract that gives you a return on your investment (% of my paycheck each month for a year or more) if your help results in job placement. I am serious.

But today, I finally cleaned up, organized some things, and washed my clothes. And.. I want to be proud of myself, but I'm not sure if I should be. 

Like, on one hand, my room looks nice now. Not perfect, but passable. And I have more clean clothes to wear. And I found my phone charger. 

On the other hand, I'm embarrassed that it ever got this bad. Like, I, as a functioning human adult, feel as though I should be better than this.

I really don't know if I can be happy about it or not. But at least my room is clean, so there's that.

All I’ve done is lose,"It’s like my life has never gone up. I grew up in a moderately wealthy family, I had excellent grades across the board, smart, was good at sports and music, popular, had quite a few hobbies, and in my school they thought I was a looker too…

Now I’m 22, I’m a college dropout, unemployed, living in a cheap hostel with barely any money and estranged from my family. I’ve given up or lost interest on most of my hobbies and won’t call the few people I’m in contact with my friends. Stopped going to the gym, don’t know why I cut off my long hair, haven’t been on a date in over a year. I mean I know I can fix some of these but it’s not like when I was more fit and went to parties every week and had a part-time I was a much happier person.

I guess some of those things that I had were just illusions, but at least the illusions kept me happy. Like if I didn’t know what my parents were doing was abuse and I didn’t run away from them maybe I’d still be in school, still have money, still have relatives who act proud of me and a younger brother who looks up to me.

In high school I was one of the popular kids. I hung out with the preps, studied with the nerds, played sports with the jocks and spent the evenings playing games with the geeks. But I guess at some point I just played a shit ton of video games to escape my parents and fucked up my sleep schedule so hard, and then I still tried to maintain my dropping grades so I cut out most of my after school socializing and didn’t go to people’s birthday parties and shit anymore and now I don’t even know if the kids I used to hang out with remember that I exist.

I mean, they’ve all moved on to something better. A few of them have their own businesses with their parents’ money, some of them are doctors and programmers and bankers, a few of them rich enough to just party away and not care about college. I don’t even know if they’d want to associate with me anymore. Recently my ex from 8th grade asked a friend of mine how I was doing (I’m not on any social media) and I was gonna reach out and say hi but then I looked at myself in the mirror like a malnourished, ugly, broke dropout.

Meanwhile the new friends that I’ve made are fleeting, but I don’t know if I can complain because they’re just as self-destructive as I am and in a way I’m just lucky that it’s not caught up to me yet. I latch on to the few old friends that I still have but really we have nothing in common anymore. All these people with so many close friends that they treat as their second family and boyfriends and girlfriends that aren’t psychotic or abusive and I’m stuck in a recycle bin with all the other rejects and delinquents, but even there they think I’m too much of this way or another.

I don’t even know what I want out of my life. I’m just here wasting time until I run out of money and die I guess. I don’t know what winning is to me or what success feels like because every time I try to build towards something I become disinterested in what’s ahead in whichever path I take. To say that I peaked in high school would mean that my high school life was better than my middle school life, more accurately I peaked the day I came out of the womb and it’s been a decline ever since.

It’s not being behind that irks me, it’s the fact that once I’m behind, I’m left alone in the dust. I’ve never really wanted much out of life - some friends I trust, someone to love, a job I don’t hate, enough money to put food on the table and not be so fucking depressed all the time, but so far none of that has happened yet no matter what I do.

You guys know the Pokemon Slaking? It’s got the stat total of a legendary and a pretty good move pool, but it’s handicapped by an ability that makes him dick around once every other turn and as a result he’s one of the worst Pokemon in the game.

If I kill myself I want to see certain people's reactions TW: suicide,"I care more about other people than I do about myself. I've dedicated my life to being the person to other people that I never had. I over compensate when I do something wrong, I spend so much time focusing on other people that I don't take care of myself and I ignore my own triggers so people can rant to me. Sometimes I wish I didn't make myself that person so nobody would care if I killed myself. I also want people to realize that what they did to me killed me and if they didn't do what they did I would still be here. If I did kms I would want to see the people that hurt me's reactions. I want to see their faces when they realize that if they just shut up and weren't assholes someone wouldn't have died. I want to see their faces when they realize they killed me and I want them to soak in it. If I killed myself my suicide not would have a list of names, bullies names, and it would say at the bottom, ""This is your fault, you killed me."" I would also want them to know about the note.

It’s getting harder and harder,"I had been depressed for a while but now it’s getting so much worse and i don’t know what to do.

I spend my days not wanting to do anything, with a constant feeling of apathy and sadness from when I wake up until I go back to sleep, but this last week I'm starting to have more recurring suicidal thoughts and I really don't know what to do, I'm desperate.

I have friends I could talk to but I don't want to look dramatic or scare/worry them, I know they love me but I haven't felt that for a long time, I don't feel loved by anyone at all. I also don't think talking to them would solve anything or make me feel any better. 

Since I was very young I have lived with a very unstructured family that has done nothing but fill me with traumas and deprivations that I now have to deal with every day and I can't take it anymore. 

I'm at my limit I'm so tired of feeling like no one cares about me or that I'm never anyone's priority, always the second choice. This feeling of loneliness is killing me i can’t even describe it.

There is never anyone to congratulate me on my achievements or anyone to care for me when i can't take it anymore so what’s the point.

Things stacking up and I don't know how to handle it,"This year actually started quite good for me. I found a girl that brightened up my life after years of being alone. She is mental unstable because of events in the past, but in therapy and on medication for that. The first month went perfect, we even went on vacation. It was the first time I traveled by plane in another country.
After the vacation, everything went downhill. First my car broke down, which I need for my job. After a few days of repair and an expensive bill (be aware, I just brought the trip, so I was already short on money), I got my car back and on the very day I got my car back, my girlfriend started getting more and more distant and had a mentally breakdown. After that, it first seemed everything would go better, but at one point we had a talk and she suggested a break because of her mental state and that she can't give me the attention I deserve.
I was optimistic that after short time we might get back together and she told me, she was hoping to get there too, because her feelings were still there for me.
Two weeks after our conversation, I got COVID infected and was unable to do anything for over a week. In that time, she was the loveliest and most caring person to me.
Now two weeks after I recovered, she got silent again till today where I asked her about everything and all signs are leading to a full breakup.
I just don't know to handle everything anymore. I can't eat and if I eat anything, it just comes right back.
Sleep is rare and if I sleep, I have nightmares.
At the moment I try talking to friend, try to play some of my favourite video games but everything feels like hard work and I just want to lie down and cry all the time.
Any suggestions what I can try?

just my uninteresting life,"Hi my name is André I'm 16, I'm making this post because I wanted to know if someone could help me out of this boring and repetitive situation of mine.  I've been more introverted than usual for a while and I don't know exactly why, I don't feel comfortable around people, I don't really know how to describe it.  I have extremely low self-esteem so that's why I don't feel like leaving the house either because I worry a lot about what other people will think about, for example, the clothes I'm wearing, my aesthetics... (I'm doing this post on redit because here I can stay anonymous or at least most won't know who I am.).  I think the problem has been getting worse as I went on vacation because the time I have on vacation is around 3 months, so I just sit at my pc all day, literally I don't do anything anymore.  I decided to make the post today because today I needed to leave the house and on the way I saw several people and the only thing I could think of from each of them was: ""how shitty my life is right now... people having fun or at least distracting themselves from all the problems they probably have while I sit in a chair every day playing the same boring games"" (I passed by a beach, and as I mentioned a few sentences ago I have almost 0 self-esteem I don't go to the beach or anything like that).  I don't know if I was able to express myself very well in my post because I don't know how to express myself about what I naturally feel but at least I tried.  if anyone has tips please leave them in the comments so I can test and see if my life improves a little.  (in case anyone wonders why I was talking about this here instead of talking to a psychologist or psychiatrist, I don't know the exact difference between them, it's because I didn't trust these people to tell them about my personal life, any more than I trust people in general. for me it's easier to talk on the internet where no one knows me and they don't know what my face looks like than telling someone eye to eye that i'm 100% sure i wouldn't have it so easy to tell the things like I have to do here) Thanks for your attention.",user382844,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh1abl/just_my_uninteresting_life/

I am so useless I’ve been yelled at for not being helpful enough, i would be better off dead. I would stop taking up so many resources and that friend still has a safety net of other people that they’ve gone multiple times. They’ll do better without me. Everyone would. I’ve tried telling my family this, but instead they also say they want to kill themselves, I walked away from that almost in fucking tears, and yet they say “what went wrong?

im 15 and these two beliefs of mine are ruining my mental state and making me feel constantly hopeless,"Im 15 but i've been diagnosed with depression since i was really young. I suffer from stuff outside of depression (i might have schizophrenia if that changes anything) and lately these two thoughts i keep having have been worsening my depression day by day and making me lose all hope for the future. 
One of the beliefs i've been struggling with is feeling like all humans are inherently bad people by default. I can't trust anyone i talk to and i feel like no matter what happens the only person i can trust is myself. I have a general hatred towards humans and i've shut myself off from the majority of my friends because i assume sooner or later i'm going to realize they're horrible people. The second belief that's been affecting me and making my mental state worse is believing that no matter how hard i try it is impossible for humans to get into a healthy relationship. I've currently been dating this girl for a year and a half and things went okay until recently where i've been extremely paranoid that something she'll do something bad to me and im basically mad at her a lot without any actual reason and just because im paranoid that she's going to do something bad to me. I have relationship trauma, and im extremely focused on the future and part of the reason im dating her is because we have plans to spend our future together and i used to find a lot of comfort in it but now im just scared because i can't even trust her. It's gotten to the point where i genuinely don't believe romantic love is real and believing so is just setting yourself up for being taking advantage of or manipulated. I'm severely depressed and angry all the time because of my fear towards humans and relationships and now i don't know what to do or where to go. Does anyone know of any advice or what could be causing this?",Curious-Difficulty-9,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/whcffl/im_15_and_these_two_beliefs_of_mine_are_ruining/
hate myself,"My life should be fine, I'm fortunate enough to be in a good household with amazing parents and siblings who I love dearly, but I don't even know anymore. I have never had the urge to hurt myself nor have I had this many suicidal thoughts in a while but tonight it just feels terrible. I feel so distant from all my friends at school as they all do stuff without me but then act like I'm still their friend ""oh why don't you sit with us anymore"" but whenever I do they just make fun of me for being a loser. Stuff like that. I just really hate myself, I hate my face, body, social skills, and just my entire personality. I feel weird typing this out as I've never told anyone else about my feelings and they just think I'm weird probably. My life shouldn't even be bad but I just can't stand myself and wish I was anyone else or was at least able to hold a conversation with the people I used to enjoy spending my time with. I hope I'll be fine but if life feels this shit while I'm in a seemingly good spot makes me wonder if life is worth living on. I'm too scared to kill myself though so I hope it gets better.

Crying quietly next to my partner so they don't wake up,"Sometimes I get overwhelmed with emotions and I can't stop crying. I get upset easily and I feel like I ruin everything for everyone. I was sad because I forgot a cup of seashells at the beach but then it turned into thoughts like ""You're so useless you can't even remember something as simple as a cup of seashells. If they were so important to you then you wouldn't have forgotten them. That's why noone talks to you. All you can do is cry."" I cried until a migraine made me sleep.

Feeling down (21M),"Yeah, I’m feeling down of late. I’m only 21 and never had a gf and feel like at this point I’ve been conditioned to never have one. As if my mind has been trained to believe that I’ll never have one. Like, just the idea of having one makes me uncomfortable. It’s like part of me wants to but the other part wants to stay in my comfort zone.

Over the last 4 months my life has been feeling really repetitive. I wake up at 7am get ready, go to work (I’m a student interning at a company), come back home at 6pm feeling tired with no energy so I just lay down watching YouTube until I fall asleep. Rinse and repeat.

I always feel tired, I don’t eat enough (because I’m always tired), I don’t exercise enough, I don’t socialise ever except with my family and coworkers who are like twice my age. My eyes are starting to hurt from staring at a screen all day and I am starting to feel like I’m just rotting at such a young age. I never lived the college experience because I was financially responsible and stayed home with my parents and now I only have one year of uni left.

numb.,"I feel so completely and absolutely numb right now. Like anything that has happened over the past couple months had fucking no effect. The good the bad and the in-between, like I'm falling through life with no way to change my course. I feel like I'm falling but I don't see the ground, something is building up and I don't see if it's good or bad. 

I just want to feel happy again, I want to love, I want to cry, I want to feel absolutely anything. I'm half tempted to go back to the Psyche ward and start over again. I think it's because the way I express feelings is through physical affection and stuff like that and I have absolutely no way to express that *massive* side of me. 

I just want anything, any once of Joy, anger, sadness hell even attention. Nothing would make me happier than to be in a position where my brain produced the chemicals that made me a normal human being but yet here I am, alone with no agency in life.

So I suppose I'm stuck here until I can get enough money to change something about my life or find something/ someone to change it with me.

I wish I had chosen a different path,"Currently I have ONE group of friends, of which I fell in love with one of the friends. It's been already 6 years that I know him. I have realized it pretty early as well, but tried to hide it from coming out. Lately, it has been killing me tho. And what I did not expect and have also only realized now, is that it was bugging me for all these years - I was struggling with all of this so hard and so long. Never fell in love, because I guess I was already in love. Falling into depression on and off, again and again.

Now I am about to tell him. I have to tell him that i need to stop seeing him at all. But somehow that cant work, as I am not the only friend in this group. Also Ive been digging to see him all the time these last years. Changing all of that makes me feel so fucking down I cant describe it.

I've been crying so much these last days. It is so weird. I am kinda lost with everything else as well. Somehow this has been influencing me so long already and in a bad way. I dont know what to do. I dont know what to think. I dont know what to expect. It just kills me.

When depression causes you to lose empathy/sympathy for others,"I hope maybe I can find others here that have felt this, because I feel like such a terrible person these days. I can’t handle bad news or sad things anymore. And I feel like this stems from how sad and bad news has seemed to filter into every aspect of my family. Everyone in my family has gone through it their entire lives. We didn’t play games and laugh at family gatherings. We sat in a circle in the living room and talked about what tragedy had happened recently. I, personally, haven’t had much happen TO me compared to the rest of my family. But I have intense anxiety and depression. My dad recently died of cancer, and my mom has been battling medical problems for as long as I can remember. And it’s all she talks about. She, and the rest of my family do this thing I call “tragedy bombing”. You walk into a room where they are or start a totally innocuous conversation and then before you know it, you’re getting a rundown of every tragic thing that has ever happened to them. Like you got a bomb dropped on you out of nowhere. For years I have listened to this, but my depression and anxiety have gotten worse and worse, and I’m at the point where I avoid walking into a room with my mom because I just can’t do it anymore. I can’t hear it anymore. I get anxious. My heartbeat picks up. I get simultaneously short of breath and sad and angry. And I usually get pulled into these tragic conversations for upwards of 30-40 minutes at a time. There is no “hey, can I talk to you?” either. Like I said, it’s very just “here, have all this tragic information. Boom.” Afterwards I feel so drained I can’t do anything for the rest of the day. I’ve tried to tell my mom I can’t shoulder that burden anymore, but she either gets mad or just keeps going. I feel like I can’t even walk to go get a glass of water without her seeking me out to talk to me about something super depressing and heavy.

I started realizing that I have lost my empathy/sympathy because of it. I can’t watch serious shows. I can’t listen to sad stuff. When my friends have something bad happen in their life, I think, “no, anything but this”, the great irony because I need a lot of support from them, but can no longer offer it. I am tired and just want to sleep. I don’t want to “deal with people”, but something in the back of my mind says, “I don’t want to deal with people who have baggage”. I feel like I just reached my limit of sadness that I can take, and I feel horrible for it, which is further fueling my depression And making me feel like a terrible person. I feel so terrible for being someone who has mental illness, but can no longer relate to or offer support to others who have gone through something or who also have mental illness.

Just a long rant of different things,"If you read all the way through, I really appreciate it.

What’s it even like to not have depression? How can people just go and live their lives and not feel they way I do, especially my peers? This is the only reliable place I can go to vent, unfortunately. And then I kinda just feel alone. 

I looked up for the statistics for the things I suffer with and then I realize I’m in the minority because the majority of people *don’t* feel like this. Like sure there’s “treatment,” but there’s not a cure for this stuff. I’m never not gonna feel nothing all the time. I don’t even remember what it was like to feel something other than nothing. And when I do feel “happy,” I just feel disgusted at the emotion because I know it makes me positive and idealistic. 

There’s just too much stuff I’ve been through that I don’t even know how to process, or what it even means. I don’t even know if I have trauma or not. I don’t know what’s normal or what it’s like to be normal. There’s too many uncertainties in my life. Too many things I’ve been through that I feel like the average person wouldn’t understand…

While growing up, I have been shamed for showing signs of my mental illnesses and mental health issues from people who should have helped me, such as my parents, siblings, and teachers. How was I supposed to know what was wrong with me or that I even had a problem in the first place? And now I feel I am too far gone anyways and that it is too late to get help. It’s not like therapy’s an option right now anyways…

Life finally seemed good after a turn for the worst but it kinda feels worse now,"When I was 12 my mom suddenly passed away and I lived with her my whole life and only saw my dad every other weekend and a trip in the summer. So my dad had custody since he was the father, which was ok at first but was definitely not what it seemed. Later living with him it made me realize how much of a terrible person he is, how manipulative he is, and how controlling he is. Long story short he has manipulated me into pushing the people that can help me away, doesn’t let me spend any of MY money that I saved up for and I literally just want to buy a new computer that’s all, he says he is low on money all the time but he has a 6 figure job, and is a pathological liar. 

He treats me like trash, always trying to bring me down and make everything seem like he is perfect. He will constantly say “depression doesn’t make you stupid so just work harder, and everyone has depression to a certain extent” yes depression doesn’t make you stupid but it gives you little motivation to work with, and everyone doesn’t have depression is like a constant sadness. He always tries make me feel better with a cookie from the gas station down the road, which is like a big fuck you imo like he is basically just here’s a cookie now quit it. He has made me very alert of every sound footstep I hear I’m always listening because of him.

I have been hospitalized 4 times because of him. The first time we had a meeting and was like “ ok let’s work on it” it made me really happy but then when I was discarded on the ride home he said everything I said was bullshit.

In between the first and second hospitalization during the summer while we vacationed to grandma’s and he had to leave early because of work reasons so I stayed a month before going back home and while he was home he bought a puppy from a breeder and literally picked the worst dog for our living situation, don’t get me wrong I love the dog to death and would give the world to him but he is a English springer spaniel which has tons of energy, and is now 1 years old and can barely sit down most of the time when told so, I feel so bad for the dog because he will probably never get proper training and will probably live a terrible life with my dad. But during the second hospitalization nothing too special happened except with this one quiet time rule where after every activity we had to stay in our rooms quiet for like 15-30 minutes I forget and if we were loud we would get called last if it was lunch or dinner time. So I protested against the rule so they decided to take me off my antidepressant and put me on a mood stabilizer for bipolar and other disorders, which is honestly is a big fuck you because “I’m too angry” or whatever, literally just stood in the hallway complaining about it to the staff in the hallway, nothing more nothing less.

Third hospitalization (different hospital) was honestly one of the better ones for one reason, this one staff named Stan, honestly is one of the smartest people I know who I wish I had a hotline for, he has gained my respect and I gained his. He would literally do his job for free if he didn’t have bills to pay and a family to care for. He should honestly write a book, hope we can play one more game of rummy 500 :) he made me feel like a human being because he never put himself higher than anyone else and would always treat us with respect, you should never let anyone tell you because I’m a adult and your a child, which is not a reason and if anyone says that to you it shows that they are very week minded. 7

Fourth hospitalization (same as third) was the point I stopped letting these hospitals butter me up to send me back home to dad and be all happy for a few weeks and then send me back a few months later, had a good time with Stan again.

Now here I am now in a residential and am nearing my first month, I have met my beautiful girlfriend here which was amazing because we just clicked, but she got hospitalized for almost 2 weeks now and yesterday I just had this pain wrenching feeling in my chest I’m going to die not by killing myself or anything but just a feeling I’m going to die idk why but I did.

I felt fine today but i don’t know it just felt like a panic attack I don’t know what those feel like because if it is it is my first one, and I honestly don’t know because I just been in a slightly ok mood since I’m still able to have fun time but it’s just like a weight on my back, I just don’t know what to do because I just constantly have this looming fear of dying like I could die any second when I have nothing to distract me. 

I just don’t know what to do I just feel like something and nothing at the same time idk 

I honestly just needed to get this out because I don’t have a therapist and I don’t have my girlfriend to talk to, any advice much appreciated thank you",CapnCLown,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/whem4n/life_finally_seemed_good_after_a_turn_for_the/

Tired of being rejected for being short,"I’ve just wanted to have love in my life for so long. I want someone who I can be myself with and who can be that way with me, who I can explore with, who I can hold and who I feel like I can trust. I meet these amazing people sometimes who I really get along with and connect to, and then almost always as soon as they find out I’m 5’2 she either straight up rejects me and admits that’s why or she segues me hard into a friend zone.

I feel like I've tried everything.... so where do I go from here?,"I've been depressed as long as I can remember. I was 6 years old first time I said I didn't want to live anymore. I grew up in a lower-middle class home. I had a loving &amp; supportive family who immediately got me into therapy after I said that. I've been in therapy ever since. I was diagnosed with major depression at 10. It got better for a while 12-16. I didn't feel consistently happy per se. But I had longer periods of time like I could breathe and then one day they stopped.

 I'm 25 now. These past 3 years have been particularly difficult. I cant enjoy anything.  It' so hard to get out of bed or even my apartment. I have periods where I'll spend 2 or 3 weeks without stepping foot outside. I get my groceries &amp; medication delivered, my therapies &amp; physiatrist appointments are virtual. I'm not agoraphobic. I'm just so tired. I cant maintain friendships not because of drama or anything. I'm just so fucking exhausted (mentally, emotionally,and physically. I cant keep up even in the slightest. The only person I have in my life is my mom. Which sounds pathetic. But it's true. She stops by once a week. She calls me every couple days to make sure I haven't killed myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the thing: I'm not sitting around moping. I want to get better. I want to get better more than anything. In my lifetime I've been through 12 different therapists, 4 PHP programs, 7 IOP, and 5 impatient programs. I've tried just about every combination of anti-depressants. I've even done TMS and ECT therapy but nothing works. 

I'm still trying.... because I really want it to work. Right now I attend 2 support groups, one is for people with Dysthymia that meets weekly over zoom. The other is a major depression group that meets every other week. I do AA meetings (I've been sober 5 years) weekly. I go to therapy 2x a week and I see my psychiatrist monthly. I also maintain a healthy diet and exercise. *(to the best of my ability. The crippling lethargy that comes with depression makes it near impossible to do regularly)* That's been my treatment team/plan for about two years. I know it's not working.  

I feel like I've tried everything. But maybe I havent? Are there other treatments or therapies that have worked for you that I haven't mentioned?  Please let me know. I'm desperate.

I want to die so bad. I dont want to be in this kind of pain anymore. But I cant do that to my mother. My brother OD a couple years back and the grief I felt (and still feel to this day) is astronomical. I bet its even worse for her. I cant kill myself knowing I'd be giving her my pain.

Cant feel emotions in my body anymore,"Is it normal to lose the ability to feel emotions in your body?

Posted something similar days ago, but have found a picture to show what i am experiencing, or more accurately not experiencing. 

Before i used to have really strong and intense physical responses to my emotions, and i would Feel them deeply. 

Now i dont Feel anythfing in my body. Not even the warmth of contentment and relaxation. Only stuck in neutral. 

Also dont Feel tired when working out! (This one is so strange), and never sink back into my chair. I never get that nice heavy feeling in my body. Still just neutral. 

This has happened over the last few weeks! 

I can cry, but I dont feel any emotion in my body when I do. My chest does not tighten and I cant feel the sadness like that. My chest just feels empty and hollow. I try to feel, but it still just empty in my body.

I also dont feel touch like before, I am not numb, but I dont get tingles or good feelings in my body with touch or hugs. I dont get warm feelings in my chest and stomach. Still just empty. 

I feel like there is no connection at all between my brain and body, so the body does not generate an emotional response.

Sometimes I can feel sad in my brain/mind if that makes sense, but then I cant feel any emotions in my body at all. It is so strange. Sometimes all that happens is i get this muscle contracrion in my chest and back, but no pressure or other sensations. 

I cant react in an angry manner with voice changes and body language, but on the insade i still cannot Feel that surge of rage.

Anyone else dont feel any emotions in their body? Can this get better?

Am I (19f) depressed?,"My parents tell me that because I am clothed, with a full belly of food, and a roof over my head... That I should be happy. I almost feel ungrateful- Because I am not. 

Here is my most recent journal entry: 

""My only plans for the future are to live a mediocre life. That's the only way I see things working out. I will work a job I do not love, settle for a person I can tolerate, and never live beyond my childhood home. Not much excites me anymore. I am not beautiful nor smart nor interesting. My existence will be an insignificant blip in the universe. Maybe I will die before my mother, so that I will not die alone. 

I think I want to die. I visualized myself holding a gun to the temple of my forehead. I was not appalled by the idea. Or maybe a hanging would be easier. I don't know. I just can't keep living like this. My brain feels heavy and I constantly feel numb. 

I think I will acquire a handgun. When things become too much. I want to feel nothing, do nothing, *be nothing.*""

"thinking you’ve hit rock bottom, then it gets worse","yea i’ve been on a sad streak for years. it started off as me just feeling sad all the time, but the sadness kept increasing. i don’t know how to describe it other than levels of sadness. i would tell myself i’m just really really really sad, but not depressed. because it’d be embarrassing if you’re really just sad but say you’re depressed. but everytime my level of sadness increases, i think to myself “wow this is it, i’ve reached depression, i can’t get worse from here.” but then it does. it gets worse. so now i consider it levels of depression. i’d get more depressed, but never consider it rock bottom, because it’s embarrassing to say you’ve hit rock bottom, when you’re actually really just depressed. and i really thought it’d end there. but i keep getting more and more depressed. it gets so much worse everytime, and i’d be wishing to go back to my previous level of depression because at least it’s “comforting” instead of soul crushing. but now here i am, wondering to myself, have i actually reached rock bottom? because it feels so so so bad right now. life is no longer life to me. it’s just a game, cause there’s no way THIS is life. but this can’t be it all right? no matter how sad i am, i never think i’m sad enough. so now i’m sitting here wondering if this is the worst it’ll ever be, knowing, yet ignoring, the inevitable. which is that i will in fact reach yet a deeper level of sadness.",porcelainskull,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/whdrsb/thinking_youve_hit_rock_bottom_then_it_gets_worse/
18 and wish I was dead,"Ive been struggling with depression for ad long as I can remember. Finally got diagnosed a year ago.
After experiencing severe trauma( diagnosed with ptsd after) when I was 16, it has been at an all time low for sometime now. 
I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my parents. I hate it all. I’m so tired all the time. 
Ive always had this dream of being a musician, and seeing the world. But I’ve had no motivation to make myself get up and practice. It makes me spiral harder. Because I look at myself and think, “wow you can’t even force yourself to do something that makes you happy, you’re pathetic” 
I don’t see a point anymore of being here. I know I have people that care, and I have a lot more life to see. But what’s the fucking point? Every older person I work with looks at me and says “you think this is hard, just wait, it gets worse”. If it’s worse then this, I won’t be able to do it anymore. Every person that has important to me has left me or just taken advantage of who I am. Im here for others, not for myself. I’m mindlessly existing with no hope.
My little siblings help keep my head up, i wanna adopt them from our toxic households. But I feel like they deserve better than a sad sack of shit big sister.
I am stuck. I don’t wanna be here. I cant push myself anymore. I feel broken and alone. So what’s the fucking point? I need help or someone to help validate how I’m feeling, give me some guidance.

In the las few years I've only been able to find peace when I take the time to plan about to end with everything, I just don't have the energy to figure out life anymore.

I think some people can't just be happy, we are miserable by nature and it doesn't make sense that we try so hard to survive because it's very painful for us and for those who love us.

"My Therapist left me feeling worthless, I need support","This is long but please read I am so mentally destroyed because of my therapist. 

Today's session left me feeling worthless &amp; than I was a failure and I didn't expect it from my therapist who I had so much trust in. 

I was talking to my therapist about being lonely. It's something I've struggled with &amp; have brought up the her before (this time though had a specific trigger). After that I told her some classes I'm planning on taking to help myself get out more (which she had told me to do) and I was looking forward to taking these classes. (Pottery, Martial Arts, Painting, etc)

It went downhill when I said the classes have to wait a few weeks due to an injury to my arm that won't allow me to participate. They have flexible start times, so the wait is only a few weeks. 

All of a sudden she started blaming me for feeling lonely because I was putting off these classes. I stressed to her again that it was beyond my control due to my injury but that wasn't enough. 

She then went on to blame me about changing my mind on college. Awhile back I mentioned thinking about it but due to many personal reasons that she has previously heard &amp; claimed to understand that college isn't possible this year due also partly to things beyond my control. 

I explained to her that I want to take things slow. I've had several personal tragedies this year (that she knows about) and even if I wanted college right now I'm in no mental shape to deal with that on top of my full-time job. I'm also thinking I'd perfer vocational school instead of college.

I want to take these next few months and put my life back together. I want to take life a day at a time, I want to get back to things I enjoy. I want to clean my house because it's become a mess in my depression. I want to get out and meet new people, I want to take casual classes with things that interest me without all the deadlines &amp; stress. I want to go hiking on my days off again. I want to start training again for a 5k when my arm heals…. 

After months of stress, of worry, and running around having to deal with every new life altering problem. I don't want to jump into a classes that I don't even want to take. I want to find myself again. 

She didn't understand that, she said I'm wrong &amp; that I need to go to college no matter how hard it is &amp; how expensive it is and that's the only way I'll succeed in life…

I left my session today is tears. It's been 7 hours since my session and I can't stop crying. I feel so hurt by the person I trusted wouldn't hurt me. I feel betrayed, I feel lost, I no longer have the support because she was my support. I don't know how to move past this.

panic attacks because of opening up to a coworker,"Hello! I (M) started a new job recently (~couple of months) and pretty early on I got along great with a coworker (F). We would spend a lot of time at work together since we were a great team even though our job roles don't usually permit teamwork.

I have had depression for 13+ years and have worked on it for the last 8 years with therapy/meds. I was very stable before I joined this job. I have never experienced Anxiety symptoms in my life. I never get afraid of anything, to be honest. When you are on death's door and death doesn't scare you nothing can really scare you anymore. At least that was my thinking prior to this.

She and I talked deeply about issues we have, where I told her I have depression and am medicated. Usually, I would never share this with a coworker but she made me very comfortable somehow.

Eventually, my feelings for this coworker developed over weeks, and I felt some kind of anxiety developing in me. I was afraid of disappointing her professionally and/or privately. I would go out of my way to work immensely to help her out. I would work in my free time to help her out. Every time I got to work I would have this feeling of immense stomach pain, like butterflies but x100. My hands are shaking, I am short of breath and honestly, I can't really describe it. I have never experienced something like this before. I would have these panic attacks every time I would face her. If she was in a bad mood I would take it personally and would feel sick to my core.

Eventually, I had a depressive episode/breakdown in front of her, I was honestly close to jumping out the window that day. I wasn't that close for years. Since then I have been just a mess emotionally. I feel so ashamed and broken. She is very supportive and actually kind of a great person considering the circumstances.

Nonetheless, I am afraid of my anxiety around her or WHY I feel this way. I don't want to feel this attached/needy of anybody. Before I joined this job I was very independent. I am single and very happy about it in fact.

If anyone can give me tips on how to deal with this anxiety PLEASE tell me.

I will try to talk to my therapist and change meds ASAP. I changed meds recently and never felt this low with prior ones.

Should I distance myself from her?

Should I just straight up quit?

Should I take a long vacation?

Being Queer in a Hell Hole,"So I live in the Caribbean as a queer 24 yr old male and it has not been fun.

For a while, things are fine, meh, neutral and there is not much pressure so things are slow. I try to take advantage of these moments. But sometimes, I get into a spiral and at this point they are valid and they come from a real place.

For a while now I have been feeling so much envy and frustration of being born in an environment where I can not express myself safetly or freely. Not at homes, not with friends or school.

My whole world is in my head and my living life is just this waiting game. I have never been in a relationship, I have never experienced intimacy and I really want to but I can not.

I can blame this country all I want, I can self hate, envy ... that wont change anything right?

So I try to work on myself so that I can be useful eventually, but I feel I have been doing this since my teens.

Since my teens I have been seeking a way out of this country but because of my mental health, I can not be as explosive or creative, useful or impressive. I don't have friends hat help me play, jsut an annoying family situation where I feel stuck and disgusted.

I don't want to live anymore but that is not an option. It won't fix or improve anything just create more pain so what am I?

A long depressing year,"It all started going downhill friday the 17th of december 2021, when i got caught buying 2gs of weed at a park at night and a fucking cunt of a police man who wasnt on parole decided to ""work"" all of a sudden. Im italian, here is illegal to buy weed and the police is obsessed with it. I study medicine, im not a degenerate and spending time chasing weed smokers is a fucking waste of time, but thats how it is here (oldest population in the world). Medical cannabis is avalible BUT only 1 place in italy produces it, so it costs 800€ per month to people with sla, alzheimer, parkinson, chronic pain ecc... a violent fucking system. I was an activist for the legalization of this substance, but the old people in the justice system couldnt give a fuck about 1 million signatures.
They took my id and now every time the police stops me they search for drugs on me.
I had a girlfriend at the time. She helped me a little at the beggining of the year, but my depression grow bigger and bigger, i just wanted to die this winter. Ive had many abusive friends, my gf wasnt better. In the 2.5 years we were together i helped her getting out of depression and was ALWAYS avalible for her when she had insomnia. Her ex boyfriend was 28 when she was 15. She never admitted to be a victim of a pedophile and every time a therapist told her so she just changed therapist and started all over again. No cbt, just untrustworthy psycoanalyst. She had been super possessive over me and drowned me in her loneliness. She was never a sociable person so she could float in that post-covid situation, but i couldnt. I spent every, EVERY fucking night with her. I really loved her because she was my little precious person, i gave my everything to her. She gave me back nothing when i needed it. No love, no comprehension, no affection, every time i showed my depression she got upset, like she just wanted me to help her and didnt want someone with problems because she already had many. Man i felt like a turd. My gf, the person i loved so much, i gave my all to, just wouldnt help me. Couple of months later she dumped me like the biggest piece of trash. I still remember the look of disgust she had towards me just for having a major depressive episode. How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even put any effort in helping me back. 
 I lost all my erasmus friends with covid (they went back to their country) and i live far away from home. I couldnt make any new ones because of my gf and how passive i was in the relationship(we lived in the same campus, basically together). I also spent 26 days in isolation in a remote hotel-covid with no internet, shitty food and cockroachers, because i caught the virus and the campus couldnt handle me apparantly. I understood how fucking dehumanizing prison is.
When she dumped me, i started cbt but became addicted with benzodyazepines, though i started taking ssri so I could get out of bed, finally. The problem is that i became totally apathetic, i started fighting outside clubs to feel something. Never i had done such things. Its like all the hidden aggression caused by previos trauma was the only thing i could feel. Got in many troubles.
I also couldnt study properly, so i didnt really perform at exams but luckily i still managed to keep following a lazy,
 but better than nothing schedule.
This summer i met many people and i thought that finally therapy was working, but man young people here are so untrustworthy, everyvone i swear tried to use me for money or as a fuel for their narcisisim. Only a few were decent enough to have a proper nice simple open conversation. The mysanthropism that i try my best to repress is one of the worst thing i have experienced.
Now i will go back to my campus, lonely, with tons of work to do, addictions, insomnia, a broken heart, uncertainty for the future due to war and inflation and climate change, stress and anxiety.
I know there is a lot worse (and this just makes me more depressed) but i just cant solve this question: why live?
""I just can't seem to find an answer

It Is SO Much Worse Than I Ever Imagined,"Hello, I (m15) got diagnosed with depression about 8 months ago. It was no suprise. My mom has depression and since 8th grade summer assumed I did too. I've showed signs since towards the end of quarantine. I knew what it is, ur sad all the time. Chemical imbalance. Simple. 

JESUS HOW I WAS WRONG. I was so dumb, I thought ""hey people are sad so they can't get out of bed."" NO their bodies literally cannot move and feels like it's millions of pounds. ""They are sad so they can't do work or school. "" Nope they literally cannot focus and just spaces out and has a panic attack at the thought of work. ""hey people are sad so they can't function."" Yea because depression is this fucking demon that stops everything from working as it should. 

It's so bad, I was struggling in school so bad that my counselor insisted I took the last 2 or so months off. She said learn to live and function with depression. Yea all this time later, couple phyciatrist visits, meds, therapist, depression conversations, sleepless nights, and partial hospitalization later all that's happened is I've learned some worthless skills and learned that life is hell and everything sucks. 

How I'm going to do school, no idea whatsoever. Can't sleep, can barley move, can't focus, get a panicky attack when ever I think about school. All of this with the crippling anxiety I had before I was diagnosed with depression really just hit like a truck.

Been dating for 4 months and broke up with her four times,"This is my first post in reddit and sorry english aint my first language. I was diagnosed with bipolar hypomania or mixed episodes like a year ago after being misdiagnosed with social anxiety and major deppression for five years. I didnt even know what bipolar was until I had a roomate that had that condition but I never even was aware if I was having high or lows. I was unaware for a while until I had a nervous breakdown a year ago and decided to go to three psychiatrists that diagnosed me as bipolar and I started taking depakote. 

In terms of relationships ive never had a girlfriend, only one time and it was long distance and it lasted a month because we both had numerous issues. Ive had a lot of casual sex with numerous partners mostly in my manic times and done numerous drugs and had risky behaviour, I just realized ive been doing this a year ago. 

So, to get to the point, Ive been trying to stop my medication and stop seeing my psychiatrist  , I know is a bad idea, three months ago which is around the same time I met this girl. When I met her through a friend We went to my place and nothing happened but then saw her two weeks later and hooked up, things started going really fast as it usually does and we were spending weekends together and going out on dates. I started getting needy and clingy and professing my “love” for her which she didnt correspond as she was coming out a relationship and she just wanted to hang out. So all this and the fact that I was reducing my meds was bringing up minor manic episodes at times when I would become paranoid and jealous and start pushing her away as I always do. I broke up with her the first time cause I thought we would better be friends, the I called her an hour later for her to come over. The second time was because she arrived late and then she was anxious so we made up. Third time was because I started to feel more attached and feared that I might lose her. And now the fourth time this weekend because I thought she was with some other guy which it should be cool because we only dating but I keep feeling that everyone out there is there to get me.

I went to her house with flowers and chocolates even though she blocked me and explained to her that im bipolar and although its not a excuse I like her a lot and sometimes is out of my control and I dont mean it, that I want her in my life and that I really love being with her. She said she us not a tennis ball to keep bouncing on the wal and that she is really hurt and felt like I will keep doing this all the time and she was crying and very upset with me which I understand. She said she might think it over the weekend to see if she takes me back

I honestly think she would be better off without me as Im a complete mess and I think things just might get worse, although I realized many bipolar relationships, the bipolar person is always pushing the other person away. I dont wanna keep doing this, especially not witth this girl, but she says that now she is going to be scared of anything that she says or does because I might dump her and that she will not be able to be herself. I really dont want her to feel that way, i want her to be free and not locked down on my emotional mess. I have to let her go but part of me still cares a lot about her, I just dont want to make her cry ever again or hurt her. I feel like a jerk for playing with her feelings. 

I know dropping my meds is a really bad idea but I miss my old self and wanna have a heathy relationship but im even scared of myself as im usually self centered and unaware. Never dated a girl more than three months which of course is a red flag, wanted to see if anybody else identifies or see me as a complete wacky.",jayecu95,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh8915/been_dating_for_4_months_and_broke_up_with_her/

Child with depression,"Short story..
I a (29f) dealt with depression as long as I can remember but didn’t realize what it was till after I turned 18. Too long of a story to tell right now. Anyways I’m medicated now after trial and errors so I’m okay. 

Well now I have a (9f) daughter that as I see the signs that I use to have when I was younger might suffer the same fate. She’s had very few maybe like 2 or three really bad episodes in the past of just extreme sadness and crying every few minutes. I try my best to comfort her but sometimes I feel like I don’t know what to do as when I had depression (my mom had it but her and my dad hid it from us because it was just all in her head) I had nobody to help me. So my question is what kind of help or ideas can y’all help me with to help to better comfort her? Besides medicine because she’s too young, but I refuse to let my child be left alone to deal with it because I know from experience and it’s a scary place. I’m just scared because I want her to value life and know that she will always have someone there to understand what she goes through, it just kills me to know I passed it on to her.

Some questions regarding Paxil,"I've been on 30mg of Paxil daily for the last two years. Recently, my prescription ran out and my prescriber was on vacation so it didn't get refilled. By day 2 of cessation I started getting really dizzy and neaseous. I found some stray pills laying around under my nightstand so I popped 60mg to stave off the withdrawal and now I feel even worse.

So one, should I have just taken the 30mg and if so, would it have even helped? And two, I have a full bottle of Lexapro left from when I was taking that. If I switch to the Lexapro for now until I get my Paxil refilled, will that avoid withdrawal?

A couple months ago I checked myself into the hospital (fuck the ER psych ward that place is not intended to help anyone (also the social worker who talked to me inadvertently told me to kill myself which was fun)) and attended an intensive outpatient program which actually made me feel better! For like 5 weeks, then everything went back to normal. No matter what I do the voice in the back of my head screaming ""why bother? You've always been like this, you'll always be like this"" is louder than anything else and I feel completely unable to do anything. The only advice people give is just ""you gotta do it"" which is less than helpful. Is there anything small I can do help? Or do I just have to wait until I find a med that can balance my brain out enough that I can function?",Infinitell,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh6vun/what_can_i_do_if_i_dont_want_to_get_better/

I thought I was doing better but I think that's just unraveling. I recently started working on a fanfic a little less than a month ago (so cringe I know) and I got about 5 or 6 chapters done in the first day and then it started to taper off and my motivation was stretched thin after a week or two. Usually I'd just accept it as a failed project and move on but I truly had the intention to finish this one. I really wanted to see it done and posted, I even had my best friend be my editor. All my friends that know about are cheering me on and being really supportive because I haven't written something on my own in years, My girlfriend the most so. I do have plot points I want to get to in the future, however I haven't written anything in week and I'm scared it won't be finished. I hate myself for not writing.

How to support my partner with his depression,"Before I start/for context: I’m not asking for any professional advice. I suffer from mental health issues myself (BPD, re-occurring depression, anxiety, ADHD) and I’ve been in treatment for a decade- so I’ve been around the block. Im just looking for different ways I can help my partner- more ideas.

So I’ve been with my partner for 5 years. We both have mental health issues and we have VERY different communication styles and are experience depression differently. My therapist doesn’t want me to do couples therapy until I do a year of DBT.

He’s in the process of finding the right treatment. I know I have to be patient, but it’s so hard- I’m in DBT myself and it’s hard when my expectations are different then reality..

He has poor communication, 0 energy, and he’s sad all the time and it’s starting to impact our relationship because I NEED communication. I need quality time, but his way of showing love for me is by providing for me- so it’s different than what I want. He’s not the affectionate type and he tries but I guess it’s not enough? Idk.

I try to be there for him, and anytime I try to talk to him about our relationship he shuts down. I show him what I’m learning on communication, but he doesn’t do it. At this point, I just feel like it’s his problem and I can’t do a damn thing. I get angry with him a lot and I’m trying to cope with it, but it’s hard when his behavior towards me tells me that he doesn’t care or love me. I get really frustrated. I feel invisible. 

 Does anyone have any advice on how I can be there for him? My BPD has definitely caused issues but I’m showing improvement. I’ve asked him how I can help
 and he tells me there’s basically nothing I can do. I have depressive episodes and I know what I need during those times- but he doesn’t. It’s almost like I’m talking to a void or a brick wall- nothing productive comes out of talking about this problem and I feel like I’m going to rip my hair out because nothing gets done.",Remember2Drink-Water,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh12ud/how_to_support_my_partner_with_his_depression/

my family is sinking further and further into an endless cycle of misery and horrible events and I feel trapped.,"So long story short. My family and I moved out of NYC 7 years ago after decades of living in poverty, food pantries and 2 evictions and moved to NC. It was a very rocky start, and despite wanting to move here for a better life all it's been was progressing misery.

My sister had a stroke and developed epilepsy and psuedo bulbar affect as well as being very depressed. My BIL has severe migraines and anger issues. My dad has prostrate cancer and recently got diagnosed with dementia, and my mom might possibly have it too. I've had to take care of everyone, comfort everyone, homeschool three kids with special needs on my own (I'm autistic with ADHD) because they were bullied in school but my sis and BIL who said they would help now solely rely on me to do it. And I feel like I'm not doing enough to keep up with everything like chores, homeschooling, emotional support and now cooking. I'm trying to cheer everyone up amd take care of everyone because despite having osteoarthritis and POTS I'm the most active and needed person and all I've  been is being surrounded by constant depression, stress, anger and bad news. And even worse, isolated because all my IRL friends live in NYC and I've yet to make a RL friend or even a romantic partner because all I am is stuck at home and only going out for doc appts.

I'm trying to be strong for myself. I draw and make comics because it's my passion but also because it's now the only thing keeping sane. I want to be more than a caretaker and I can't keep being the glue that keeps the family together. July was the most horrible month and it felt like everything coming to a head with terrible news one after the other including our car that keeps breaking down and being stuck at home 24/7.
I've had two intense emotional breakdowns and LOST alot of  MY HAIR that I've been trying to grow for 2 years. And my heart has been having palpitations more frequently. I feel like all this stress and misery is eating me alive, literally. All I want to do is run away from everything, run away from my family and even got to the point of wanting to hurt myself or end it all. But I can't. They all need me amd will literally fall apart without me. And I can't even live on my own because I'm disabled. I'm trying to claw my way out of a 7 year cycle of despair and I feel at this point that I'm doomed to die with a sinking ship.",Donutarigato,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh0fa3/my_family_is_sinking_further_and_further_into_an/

My most sincere testimony,"Based on the posts I’ve seen here I think that this sub might be the best place for an introvert like me to fully open and release himself. Sincere thanks to everyone who will manage to read my whole post.

I’m a 24-year old man from a Middle-eastern Europe. Since I live in Central Europe, the viewpoints, cultures and lifestyles here are very divided - some people I know are of neoliberal democratic viewpoint (pro-Biden/Clinton, anti-Trump/Putin,etc.) and other ones (mostly people from theirs 40s onwards) share social democratic patriotic viewpoint (anti-Biden/Clinton, pro-Trump/Putin,etc.) ... This division is seen as well among my family and friends. My father is a fundamental baptist fatalist - he says that this world is one big political machinery and an ultimate satanic deception, he expects Jesus’s second arrival soon to destroy this planet by fire for good. Sometimes he tells me very clearly that he wants to die and “be finally with the Lord.” My mum easily falls for conspiracy theories, refuses us to get covid vaccinated, reads alternative media and facebook posts for whole day, etc... What am I? A big mess simply said.. From the age of 16 to 21 my father raised me as a baptist as well. I was a sincere believer in Jesus Christ, I was sharing the gospel to my friends and even classmates at the university believing I might be saving them from “eternal damnation” (if they decided to believe). In order to become a good follower of Christ I studied bible, theology and history in my leisure time and at the age of 18 I signed up for studying history at the university believing it would strengthen my faith even more. Well, the opposite became the truth. I realized my whole perception of history was fairytailed. The biggest milestones were learning about the evolution, prehistory and the political aspect of dissemination of christian religion which was often done by violence (Charlemagne’s conquests, Teutonic crusades in the Baltic, Spanish inquisition, recatholization,etc.)... By the time I started learning more about evolution and biblical contradictions in my spare time and then I finally deconverted in 2020. In hopes of achieving freedom from religious limitations, only then I realized I’m lost.

Since my brain had been used to elaborate every life concept from baptist perspective for 5 years, the remnants of my past faith are still present in my mind until today. I try to consider every aspect of life with a critical and rational unbiased mind to come to the most objective and right conclusions. However it is very hard because there is still an irrational side of my brain that wants to evaluate things emotionally by christian ethics and that is how I got to know what is anxiety, the worst feeling you can possibly experience. When rational thinking collides with my past biblical opinions and interpretations, that’s when it hits. And I have these collisions everyday at every topic possible, whether it’s science, history, morals, enviroment, vaccines, etc... I realized I needed a professional help so I was attending a psychiatrist for a year. He prescribed me antidepressants encouraging me that these medicaments would make me feel relieved and in a few months these mental struggles would be over. First half a year I took Escitil and the second half I took Alventa. Even though they are supposedly “strong” antidepps, they didn’t help me at all. That’s why, after a year of treatment and spending big money I decided to seize using his services and currently am very skeptical about pharmacy industry overall.

How does my life look like now? = recurring mental struggles; I hate my father because due to his brainwashing I lost 5 years of my life devoted to delusion and especially my teen years which are essential on brain development during the adolescence period; experiencing trauma when thinking about my christian past; masturbating on daily basis because that’s the only natural thing that gives me relief and inner peace which I so desperately seek; and lastly I’m completely lost. I don’t want to fall into any religious BS or hyper conspiracy theories anymore, but as a critical observer I have to say this world just doesn’t seem to operate naturally for me.. There is a propaganda in the US and in Europe as well, including my country. There is a certain concrete viewpoint our governments want us to hold on topics like Covid, Ukraine, Russia, refugee crisis, multiculturalism, entertainment industry which is rigidly pushed by the mainstream mass media. It’s a political agenda or at least, that’s my opinion. We’re living in the age of information and with so many contradictory knowledge and opinions going from all sides, it is no wonder some people choose to follow alternative media or conspiracy theories.. Are we living in a natural world or a matrix? It is because I’ve studied the arguments of both sides that I’m lost... What is the truth? Do you believe there is an absolute truth and is worth to devote our lives to it? Is the concept of absolute truth dangerous because it produces fanatics as my dad is and I was?... You know, I guess it doesn’t even matter, in the end, we all share a common destiny, the death. The only thing that makes our lives different is how our life paths will shape towards this irreversible destiny. Some people experience a joyful life, some experience a sorrowful life.

Transitioning,"I'm on my way guys

Currently trying to filter out the things in my mind that matter and don't matter. This way I can peel off what I struggle to let go of. I believe I'm very attached to a lot of feelings while being in denial of it all. I need to differentiate between accepting and realizing so I can make some sort of change. I'm a man child that desperately wants to grow up and be a man but all the while struggling to do so. Simply because making a decision is not the same as applying the action. 

I think I'm getting closer...

It's an extremely slow and tedious start but I can feel the movement like a rock in wet sand. Sometimes I just don't know if I'll break through the surface or get swept up and covered again to be buried even further than before....I don't have a therapist because I believe in my own breakthroughs I know it's there I've guided myself this far. I wasn't born to feel the way I constantly feel and I stand by this because I was happy once upon a time I just lost my way towards the ever after... but I'm still walking. 

My ambitions are so loud that it creates a dissonance with the cacophony of suicidal thoughts. I just need one resonating sound between the two. A sort of melancholy melody that creates a cycle for both to reflect the other. If I can identify that...then I think I'll be free....

Everyday I want to die from feeling like a hard working failure and everyday I don't want to feel this way cause my potential and capabilities stare me dead in the face...if the more I strive to be better the more loss I come across, then doesn't that just mean there's something greater out there that requires me to let go of a lot? If I can somehow make sense of it all at least for myself, I think I might have a chance....

Morning exclusive depression,"So as of lately I’ve been suffering with absolutely terrible morning depression and I have no idea what to do to fix it. It started about 2 weeks ago out of nowhere and now seems like it’ll never end. The second I wake up I start panicking and just think of nothing but terrible things. I suddenly feel like everything I’ve loved is meaningless to me, like I want to quit my job and just fade away. I’m hysterical from the second I wake up until mid day. I’ve never really cried but now I wake up every morning and cry hysterically on and off for hours to the point of getting psychically nauseous and a massive headache. But then noon comes around and I feel fine, but then I’m just always so exhausted from having such bad morning episodes that I end up going to sleep like 4 hours earlier than I usually do, which is another thing I’m upset about when I wake up. I’ve stopped seeing my therapist because of an insurance issue and I just have no idea what to. It just keeps getting worse every day. I keep trying to do things that usually make me happy like listening to my favorite music or watching my favorite movies but then it just makes it worse because I start thinking “I don’t even like this anymore” I just have no idea what to do or when this will end",Finnex88,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wh19ki/morning_exclusive_depression/

Then I get the call that I'm let go from my job. Apparently a couple clients were saying that I was rude to them on phone and said things that I NEVER said. All this because they didn't hear what they wanted to hear. Also Apparently there were other issues that were NEVER brought to my attention to even try to fix. After working there for over a year. Last time they brought up an issue I fixed it, I dont see why that wasn't an option this time and why they even THOUGHT I'd do what was said.

I rescued a kitten over a month ago and since having him here my depression has gotten worse.,"I just need to get this off my chest since I don't really have any other place to vent. I feel uncomfortable talking to my family about it because I know I'm just worrying and burdening them but I'm genuinely losing my mind. My next therapy session is in 2 weeks after like 3 months of there not being space for me. I also recently got officially diagnosed with ADHD and I'm going through a transitional period since I've just graduated uni and I started a new job, so my mind's been a bit of a mess lately.

So the actual story: A bit over a month ago I found a kitten with no mom, no siblings. He was all alone and in rough shape. I took him in and I've been taking care if him ever since. Originally he was supposed to be a foster. I've taken him to the vet and he's on his way to being fully vaccinated and soon to be fixed too. Like I'm taking the well being of this kitten very seriously since I'm his main and basically only caretaker. I really want what's best for him. Unfortunately for me this means I've kind of abandoned my own well being? Taking care of this kitten has take  everything out of me. All my free time is dedicated to him since he needs to play with someone since he's all alone. He needs to be taken care of since he's only a baby and I don't resent him for that. I can't, it's not his fault. But I am exhausted. My sleeping schedule has been altered since I've had him. Again, my free time is dedicated to him and when I'm not home I'm thinking about how to better take care of him. I have abandoned all the hobbies I used to ground myself because I can't do them with him around since he always wants to be with me/interrupting anything I'm doing. I've considered finding him a home right after he is fixed since I know this isn't sustainable for me mental health wise but my dad says no one is gonna want him if he's too old. My mom wants me to keep him because she likes him but I'm the only one who takes care of him. I'm the one who has to be with him all the time. I know his kitten behavior isn't forever and he's actually a really good cat but I'm at my wits end. I'm always angry, always sad, always feeling bitter and miserable after I started getting better. Like I keep crying out for help but only receive ""but he's so cute and such a good cat, hang in there"". I'm also concerned that if I do give him out for adoption, there's no guarantee that whoever adopts him has his best interest at mind and doesn't take proper care of him, mistreats him or even abandons him. They could promise they'll take care of him but people lie all the time.

"Dealing with depression when you lose your only social, physical and creative outlet all at once.","I have been depressed for a very long time, and was extremely suicidal 2 years ago. I went to a bridge with the intent to jump off it. Anyway I found something that I became extremely passionate about which also acted as a social outlet, a way to do physical activity every single day and a way to creatively express myself, and this led me to become truly happy for the first time in a long time. This activity is skateboarding. It helped me make new friends and actually built my non existent confidence up to be able to talk to people I don't know. About 3 months ago I thought I got an ankle sprain which google told me would last about a month. Well 3 months later and it hasn't gotten any better. turns out I have tendinitis which causes me extreme physical pain and mental anguish. I have slipped back into old ways, spending all day on the computer and not answering my friends when they want to hang out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my mental health is deteriorating but at the same time I feel completely helpless to escape my terrible situation. The doctor said that I should do another 3 months of no physical activity and I don't know what I'm gonna do. Rot away in my room most likely. I've already had suicidal thoughts come back and I find it hard to sleep at night. This isn't asking for help or advice I just felt the need to vent about my problems. Oh yeah and the worst part is when (if) I get better it'll be the depths of winter which is when you can't skate anyway and when my depression is the worst.

I feel like I'm screaming and people don't hear me...or don't want to.,"I've been in crisis mode for a few days, since I found out I'll have to find a new place to live by the end of the month. Rent has gotten so high here. Maybe I'll find something, but I have no backup plan. If I can't find a new set of roommates, I will end up living in a hotel until my savings run out, and then after that, the streets. I've faced homelessness before, but I've really gotten back on my feet the last few years... I have a steady job, actual furniture, a closet full of clothes, lots of hobby supplies, plans to travel, and now I might possibly lose it all.

I relapsed self-harming after not doing it for 3 years. I mentioned it to a friend who also has battled with his own mental health problems. And he told me he's starting to resent me for being so negative and making him feel bad when there's nothing he can do to help. (He used to call me his best friend. He owns his own home with multiple empty rooms. He could literally keep me off the streets if he wanted to.) 

I would feel a lot better if there was one person I could rely on. I have friends in another country who tell me all the time that they love me and I'd never have to worry about being without a home, if only I was born there instead of here.

Did therapy help?,"So I've had some free sessions of counseling offered and it can feel nice at first to get things off my chest even though I struggle with paranoia and people's judgements of me. I've noticed there was some immediate catharsis felt when I've spoken of childhood trauma and receive some compassion and empathy in return. However after the session I felt heavy and weighted down the rest of the week like it conjured up the wounds to feel fresh and I had a renewed sense of anger. I don't know if those are necessary grief processes you have to go through when you start talking it out and then after a certain amount of time you're supposed to be healed and not affected anymore by it. But the therapy overall hasn't seemed to have made much change. 

I'm also looking into joining some zoom meetings for ACOAs and looking into getting a mentor or sponsor I'm not sure how that works or if those are offered in those meetings.

I’m seriously at the end of my rope.,"My life is in complete shambles. I’m closing in on 40, I’m massively overweight (280), bald, have very few friends, don’t see or talk to my family as often as I’d like, have a few grand in the bank and need periodic help from my father to keep up with the cost of living. I gave up chasing my dream job because I’m lazy and didn’t want to put in the grind to get where I wanted to go. I have no life insurance, no stocks, no 401K, no savings. My house is basically my only asset. I changed careers to something “easy” that obviously doesn’t pay great and told myself it’s because I wanted to settle down and start a family. I married an alcoholic and compulsive liar, who ended up making life a drunken hell, went to rehab, and started sleeping with someone she met there. She brought this man into our marital bed every chance she got, even after I found out, and that only stopped because she was going to be kicked out of the house by the courts and him not being on the property was a condition of her staying in the house. Since then, she’s left every single weekend to go off and be with this other man while I’ve been left at home to take care of our five year old daughter and wait for the divorce process to play out. She leaves before I get home on Friday and walks in on Sunday like it’s the most normal thing in the world. 

At work, I smile through the day, but all I hear are stories about everyone’s families - husbands, children, people going on maternity leave - and think about how that’s all been ripped away from me. No one is telling cute stories about me or things I did for them or the family. There are no siblings for my daughter to learn and experience life with. I’m all she’s got, sad to say. I feel terrible for her for getting dealt such a lousy hand. I’m reminded constantly on social media of people with their families and their spouses and their kids and their trips, and I feel like my life is basically one note and more or less over. I have no prospects for more family. I have no money for fancy trips. 

People I was colleagues with in my past profession have reached the pinnacle I dreamt of years ago. They’re there and I’m not. I’m reminded of their success constantly. I have no one to blame but myself, but I have no way to make up for past mistakes. The job involves traveling and odd hours, and that’s something I’m not in position to do as sole guardian and eventual custody plan, and probably never will be.

At night, either me or my “wife” puts our daughter to bed. If she does it she stays upstairs and goes to sleep. If I do it, she goes to bed herself before I finish. Every single night I am alone with no one to talk to, nothing to look forward to, no plans to make. Dating apps just serve to remind me how unwanted I am. The few that do respond typically ghost within a day or two. Every single I meet in the real world is either married, engaged, or has a boyfriend. Just as well, as I have absolutely nothing to offer them anyway. A broken family, a pale, obese, bald physique, and a few bucks. Awesome. The ladies sure are jumping at that.

If it wasn’t for my daughter I don’t know where I’d be right now. I don’t see any point to any of this if she wasn’t in the picture. I’m barely a blip on the radar to the vast majority of people, including the people I’d consider “close.” I don’t reach out and no one reaches out to me. If I wasn’t here, no one except my little girl would notice.

What the fuck am I supposed to do. I want to hit reset because everything is too fucked up to salvage. My life needs to be burnt to the ground and demoed. There’s no saving this. I’m the single suckiest, most toxic, worthless person I know. Can someone tell me: WHAT’S THE POINT!?!? Yeah, my kid, of course. But she’s just going to grow up and eventually see me for the loser I am. I am wasting my life and it’s at least half over.

Girl I’ve been dating for 6 months says she doesn’t want a relationship suddenly and ask to be left alone.,"So, I met this girl (24) I’m 27yr old Male on Tinder. Really cool girl. 
Went on a couple of dates. She was very keen and very interested in me.

On our third date she wanted to make plans to go on vacation with me in November.

On the 2nd month. She revealed that she has depression, attempted suicide when she was young and was on medication.

Kept an open mind, proceeded to see each other every weekend. For 3 months.

4/5th month decided we needed to spend time with friends so only saw each other 2/3 weekends.

We went on vacation together in two different countries for two weeks.

But, when we got back from said vacation. She expressed that her depression was getting worse (Due to a sudden crisis and fear of her future).

Only seen her once on after vacation, for a date which she almost blew me off.

I tried not to take it personally and I’ve been there for her. Gave her some space whilst checking in.

Texts were cold. Only spoke to me out of convenience. A full 180.

Then had a mini breaking point where I asked to go on a city break next week since it’s been 3 weeks since we spent a weekend. 

I expressed that quality time is important to me and it would be nice to spend some time.

She then goes “I don’t want a relationship or anything tbh. So I don’t think we should talk anymore.”

Even though we were just planning a trip to an island on November and October. Like, last week.

I then said “okay, I understand”. “I want to be here and I don’t want to give up” and “I wish we could talk”.

She then says “I’m stressed so please leave me be.”

I care about this girl a lot and I love her and I’ve been reading around. It’s not like she didn’t love me either. I don’t want it give and I want to fight the best way possible.

Any tips out there guys. I’m backing off for now until she ever reaches out to me. 

Tbh, I have been very financially supportive since our time together and have had amazing experiences. But, I believe that has also been a bad thing.

I don’t want her to feel I’m not there but how can I be present in her life without pressuring her.

Every day is worst,"
So, it's been a while since my depressed state has been growing but these days is turning hell. 

Due to summer, I am in home until september I begin again college so I spend most of the day alone only with my thoughts, so  memories came into my mind and make me feel sick, angry and extremely sad and depressed. 

The main reasons for my depressed state is that some months ago I lost the only girl I truly loved and can't forget. Also I am trying to build income or pass the college career but I failed in some areas and my parents are not very happy with this. 

My only hobby is go to gym and lifting some weights and maybe meet sometimes with a couple friends and playing some pool at afternoons or party at night. Drinking a lot of alcohol too, only thing that make me happy for a moment. 

What I am feeling is that every day I feel more sorrow and more depressed, I feel sick of the head and suicidal thoughts appear more frequently, I feel that I am a failure and living like this doesnt make sense.",Nov927,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgvk0s/every_day_is_worst/

depressed for no reason after anabolic steroids,"I'm so sad with a mix of anxiety panicky feeling sewell, all happened after using AAS I ran a cocktail of them because I was dumb, I used them prior and never had problems really. Now it's been 8 weeks and I'm pretty much on nothing at all. I did a hormone panel and everything is back in range. So I'm fucking lost, if there is no hormonal issue it might be possible I just forever fucked up my brains? Maybe there's something wrong with my dopamine receptors?

 I'm so sad and hopeless because It just doesn't seem to get better, I had a good week where I thought I was getting better and back to normal then suddenly I'm just getting depressed again?

I don't kbow what to do, Im thinking about the future sometimes and thinking I won't be around at a time because the pain is too much. I feel depressed without thinking about anything, I don't really have any reasons to this depressed and have occasiobal suicidal thoughts.


Why did I feel a week good and suddenly I feel so fucking trash again and miserable? 

I can't go to the gym I can't work becuase I simply have 0 energy anymore. I'm so happy when I'm in my bed at night knowing the day is finally over and I can relax and fall a sleep.

idk how to deal,"idk it is right place to write this but i feel i have to get rid of these thoughts someway. I dont know how to deal the uncertain emptiness inside of me. i don't even know it is really ""emptiness"" sometimes. it's just very intense feeling i cannot understand or dont know what to do with. I look around and see nothing. I feel like I never been loved , all the people i know, friends etc.  i think about and i realize i am not the person they think i am. Like everyone loves me but no one likes me. They always say ""you are like this bla bla bla"" but no I am not.  I can't deal with it. I am clearly no one. i feel very alone in darkness of in these intense emotion. It's very hard to try to tell it to someone beacuse i am not the person they think i am, and they told me something like "" you are not alone, there is a lot of people aroundyou."" ""you say you are lonely because you want to be lonely."" I am lost. things they say make me feel even worse.  What's the point of having so many people around me if I cant feel I am one of them. I don't want to feel alone but most of the time i meant to be alone.

I don’t even know what to call this feeling anymore,"(M,20) I don’t even know how to start typing this. I don’t know how to begin explaining the way I feel. I honestly do not think I should be here on the internet complaining about my life but I just don't have anyone to talk to about this right now. The only guy I would even think to try to open up to about all this is currently hammered out of his mind, and I love that for him, he deserves to blow off the steam, but tonight my mind is just everywhere and nowhere and shutting itself down all at once and I just need to get it out somewhere that isn't just my head because it is killing me.

For starters, I suppose I am worthless. I am not particularly good at anything. I am not good in conversation. Despite my efforts, I often find that I am inconsiderate and often times it is a result of my own stupidity lack of awareness. I can't make people laugh like I used to. I feel like all my friends look at me differently these days. I feel like my social skills have regressed across the board, as I can barely converse with my co workers (ive been working this job for close to 7 months), I enjoy eating nothing, I can barely convince myself to go to the gym anymore, and the list goes on but my god. I just dont know. I feel foolish for crying sometimes. If my family knew, if my friends knew... I feel like a failure. I feel as though I've just allowed myself to become a piece of shit and I am genuinely afraid because no matter how loud I scream at myself to turn the lights on again, I just can't do it. I feel lonely and I just cant find joy in so many things anymore. My favorite songs dont fire me up anymore, I usually can't even sit through them in their entirety now. Ive gone to therapy before and taken anti depressant medication before as well, and I cant afford to pay for one without the help of my parents, who do not know the way I truly feel. I love them and I feel horrible for not being honest with them about it, but I just cant compromise the remaining façade that im doing better these days. 

I cant count how many times ive tried to kick myself and get back on the wagon, but i just cant hold on. I am scared that I wont break the cycle. I know there are hundreds of thousands of people who dont. I hate myself for allowing this to happen, and at the same time I no longer have the passion or energy to hate anything. I can feel my opinions on any given subject turning from whatever firm position they were to nothing, to carelessness. I feel as though I am the worst type of person, not a protagonist, not an antagonist, not even a side character or a fucking extra in a movie. I feel like the lone viewer of a movie no one gave a fuck about, and yet I can't will myself to leave the theater already. 

It is times like this when I think back to better times, before I was even aware of the social constructs that and responsibilities that bog me down now, and those memories don't even feel like they're from my lifetime. At best it feels as though I watched it happen to someone else, or perhaps that it was one of those good dreams you try all day to remember better. I don't even know what kind of advice to ask for here, I think I just needed to get the thoughts out.

How do I know if my SSRIs are working?,"I am a 21 year old male and been on SSRIs for 8 weeks now. I'm very unsure if the meds are actually working, and I don't even know how they are supposed to work. I will try to compare different things associated with depression before taking the meds and now.

**Sleep**

Before:

* Some nights I could not sleep at all. Other nights I slept around 3-4 hours.

After:

* I sleep a little bit better now. I fall asleep easier, and i sleep around 6-8 hours. However I don't feel rested when I wake up, which make me think that the sleep I get is low quality.

**Energy**

Before:

* Very low energy. Could not get started studying for my exams. Many hours of the day used in bed.

After:

* I still don't feel like I have enough energy. I do however function on a kind of autopilot that takes me out of bed in the morning and keeps me going through the day. But my energy is still low and not normal levels.

**Depressive thoughts**

Before:

* Feelings of hopefulessness. Constantly thinking that nobody likes me, and that will always be the case. Thinking that I will always be alone, and that this way of life is not worth it. Feeling like I lost myself and I will never find myself again. Hating myself. Feeling that absolutely everyone is better than me, and that people are better off without me.

After:

* No changes here. I still have these thoughts. However a little less frequently, and when I do have these thoughts, I feel like there are so much thoughs in my brain that I don't have the energy or time to explore them all right now.

**Low episodes and self harm**

Before:

* Some very low episodes where I lost some of my control. Wanted the thoughts to go away and feel something different. Self harmed to accomplish this. Sometimes excessive use of alcohol to keep away from self harm.

After:

* The first 3 weeks of using ssri I experienced these low episodes more frequently. After 5 weeks I have not experienced this anymore. However when I experienced these lows I was alone and could do whatever I wanted to. Now I'm surrounded by family because im on vacation, and I cannot let my family know that I'm depressed. So I do not have the same opportunities to experience these lows. The fact that i also don't have the time or energy to explore my depressive thoughts make these low episodes less likely. I think that if I were alone right now, I might still get these low episodes with self harm.

**Isolating**

Before:

* Isolated from other people because I feel like the worst version of myself, and I don't want to be a burden for people. Also felt like I have nothing to contribute with. Not funny and didn't contribute to conversations.

After:

* No change. Still isolating for the same reasons.

**Loss of interest in hobbies**

Before:

* Not enjoying my hobbies. Not getting the joy I used to get from doing things.

After:

* No change.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

I'm unsure if the SSRIs are working for me because I still feel depressed. My depressive thoughts are still there, my energy is still low. I sleep a little bit better, but the sleep I get is low quality. I still isolate myself from others, and my hobbies don't give me energy or joy. I have not self harmed in 3 weeks though. This might be because of the antidepressives, but it might also just be because that I am on vacation and spend time with my family which keeps me occupied from depressive thoughts. But the thoughst are still there, and if I were alone I think I would have enough time to explore my depressive thoughts and expereince low episodes of self harm.",sunnyfdj,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgqmli/how_do_i_know_if_my_ssris_are_working/

I wish I had been an abortion,"You know that sense of accomplishment you get when you worked hard on something? I don't get that feeling.

But who wants to spend hours honing a talent or a skill just to impress other people? It's not actually that motivating.

Imagine everything in your life feels like brushing your teeth. You don't feel a sense of accomplishment after you do it and you don't get special enjoyment out of the process. But you do get to experience fewer cavities years down the line. 

The human mind is not particularly wired to pursue those kinds of goals.

"Not sad,not mad,….Just done","Why is suicide so commonly looked at as bad? Maybe sometimes it really is the only way out! I had a decent childhood not great but not terrible, I spent most of my childhood not feeling wanted by anyone, that is no way for anyone to feel especially a child. I join the military right out of high school, it was the best decision I could’ve made at the time. I was in the Air Force and spent most of my time deployed to various locations throughout the world most of which were not very safe. I was married from 20 to 22 to a British Lady. It did not in badly but it did end. Three days after my divorce was final I married my current wife. I remained in the military until I found out that I was going blind and was medically retired. I bounce between a few jobs and finally landed on A civilian contract position. I worked there for the past 15 years and in December found out my eyes were too bad to drive so I had to give up yet another career because of my blindness! I drink a lot throughout my young adult life, enough that it almost ended everything. I have been sober for going on for years now with a few hiccups in between I have not had a touch of alcohol since November which is a big deal for me. Now that I’m retired and spending all of my time at home I find myself not wanting to do any of it anymore. I’m not necessarily suicidal which I have done many times in the past, I am just done living this life! I’m not sure where to go or what to do, I’ve had therapy for the last five years and they seem to just bounce me back-and-forth between different medication‘s. I have raised three successful adults and had a 23 year marriage all of which I consider very big accomplishments. At this point I find myself alone and not wanting to carry on like everything is normal. Again, I am not sad, I’m not mad, I am just done! Who says suicide has to be looked at negatively? Over the years I have had friends that have taken their own lives, and kind of a sick way I was always jealous of their success. I understood more than most how it felt to just be done.

Does this make me a failure?,"I am 14 years old, and I wasted the best opportunity of my life and I wanted to know am I a failure because 3 months ago I lived in a Stockton with my grandparents and I had put them through so much stress ex. sneaking out, smoking weed, stealing their car, ran away for a night, getting the cops called on me multiple times and I was being stupid and reckless which was my fault and I had gotten the opportunity of a life time by moving to Lacey Washington with my aunt and uncle and their 3 children and it was everything I could've asked for Love, attention, basketball, etc. Like when I was there it had been the best 3 months of my life, I was able to go to Great Wolf Lodge, I saw former NBA players and it was all feeling right to be there but, the first month I got there I got in trouble I had taken a video of my cousin starting to fall asleep with this filter on and I sent it to this group chat with her friends in it and that was funny don't get me wrong but it was unnecessary like I had just got sat down and my uncle talked to me it was nothing really major then I really got in huge trouble I had got head by this girl, and I recorded it and word got around soon her mother found out and the mother pressed charges and my aunt and uncle was understanding about that they knew it was just a mistake and meanwhile all this is going on I'm smoking weed and that was a problem from the start because my uncle grew up like me and he always caught me when I was high so he kinda understood the problem like he knew I was getting high ( to cope with my problems) and we were going to do counseling for that and they kept asking me ""Do you want to be here?"" and I said yes and everything had gone well for a good 2 weeks until I stole money out of my cousins wallet and I took 20 dollars and I thought that was that, like I was just going to get over but the very next morning my uncle came in and told me that 40 dollars was missing now I had the opportunity to put the 20 dollars back and be honest that I don't know what happened to the other 20 because I truly didn't but I didn't, and they kinda understood everything like I had problems that I needed to cope with and they knew what I was doing at the time was just making reckless decisions at the time but what really had them question themselves about me living with them was me stealing from my cousin because stealing from your family especially with them is the ultimate disrespect and I was just worried about getting high in that moment and now that I'm sitting here crying my eyes I realize it wasn't worth it at all. Like throughout all the times when I was High, making reckless and impulsive decisions. It wasn't worth it at all none of this shit was.

And it is 3 months later and when they sat down and told me that I was leaving they told me that I can't feel like a failure or it's gonna hold me back my whole life, and that I'm not a failure it just didn't work out, but I can't help and think.

Everyone who ever hurt me gets to be happy today,"I came to the realization that some people were born lucky and some unlucky, and that life is simply not fair. Hang on with me for this one.

All my life, I went through trauma after trauma. From my parents' emotional abuse of my siblings and me or simply my dad abusing my mom in every kind of way possible, to shitty relationships with friends, romantic partners, and family.

I want to talk about a specific story.

About a year ago, my younger cousin did something to me that I will never forget nor forgive. I always knew she and her family weren't good people, they always seemed mischievous and mean in my opinion but what can I say, it's ""family"" and my dad cares about his sister and her kids a lot, even though they are terrible people. So I was forced to stay in contact with them. As I was visiting family, her mother and she made a plan to put me in deep trouble. We had a sleepover and she must've seen me put my password into my phone, and while I was sleeping she went through it without my permission. She took screenshots of almost every single thing from private conversations to pictures, even the most private, and sent them to my family. All my family hated me (they never liked my mom and my siblings in the first place, for allegedly ""stealing"" my dad so I guess it was just a way to create trouble between me and my dad). Anyways I resent them today and they never apologized to me, mind you this was a year ago. They never got any punishments or sanctions whether it was from my dad who never took my side, from this stupid universe, or from God.

Why am I saying all this? I've always expressed my dreams to my family, especially a particular job that is still today my dream job. Guess what? She got that job. She got it so easily, through parents and connections probably since she's still young and inexperienced. She's the happiest person alive even though she's evil. I've worked so hard, and never got anything.

The point is, I have many stories like this, whether it's an ""ex-fling"" who lied to me and hurt me badly by lying that he was single. I did what I thought was right by telling his girlfriend. Guess what? they're still together today. He got to go back to his calm life while I was completely and still is broken by this situation. Whether it's friendship, abusive relationships, bullying when I was younger, etc. People who did me wrong got nothing back whatsoever, which is probably one of the reasons why I do not believe in karma. I would like to note that everyone told me that ""I don't know what's going on behind doors, maybe they're unhappy"" please spare me this speech. I am not victimizing myself, nor just seeing ""the negative"", as surprising as it may sound, I've always been full of hope and the one to see the positive in every situation. 

I used to be very religious, until recently. I just couldn't do it anymore. I've always felt like God wasn't seeing me and abandoned me in a way. So what's the point of praying and hoping for the best when it simply just never comes?

I'd like to mention that I've always been a positive person, very ambitious and determined, but I can only do this for so long... I ask every night what I did to deserve this. I can't help but wonder what is then the purpose of life, religion, karma.

Please do not bullshit me by saying that it gets better, it doesn't. I've been saying that it gets better for the past 6 years. It doesn't. I try every day, I work hard, and I try to be a good person but life keeps shitting on me. It's bullshit after bullshit and I never get a break. While those who hurt me, are the happiest people on Earth and everything come so easy to them. I'd just like to have other people's perspectives on life and its purpose because the more I wake up each morning, the less I see any purpose.",Financial-Divide-951,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgm9qt/everyone_who_ever_hurt_me_gets_to_be_happy_today/

What is the point of all this?,"I used to think if I worked hard to achieve success then it would make all the suffering of depression and anxiety worth it. 

In high school I got good grades. I took AP calc/physics/chem etc, 4.0 gpa, 1490 sat, all that jazz. I thought hard work = success.

In college I realized that my understanding of hard work is naive. it doesn’t just mean getting good grades, it means being courageous, networking, and having charisma. I decided to work on myself, go to the gym every day, read self help books, work on social skills, and meditate. I spent countless hours researching diet to optimize my health. I restrict my daily diet to only the most nutritious foods because I want to feel and look good. It all makes an incremental improvement to my depression.

I’m 21 and now I realize that hard work is necessary but not sufficient for success. It also requires luck. If I weren’t so hyper focused on the end goal of success then I may have had a chance at realizing and capitalizing on the lucky opportunities that were presented to me. 

I’m alone every day and I have no career path other than a useless degree in business. 

People laugh at my business degree as if I’m stupid. I had scholarships to many schools including top ranked STEM schools. I chose business because I’m a strategic thinker with a broad set of skills that could enable me build more efficient systems from the top level. I got a minor in computer science so I can stay on the cutting edge of tech because i view programming and ML as an invaluable tool in business. However comp sci is not my passion in life so it isn’t an option career.  

No business or employer gives a shit about any of that. They don’t want someone to make their business more efficient , they want someone to follow the instructions and meet the status quo. I want change the status quo. 

they care about who I know and who I’m friends with and which frat bro at the company will give me a reference. Nepotism with extra steps.

Two parts of me,"I feel like I am made up of two parts. One part wants to get better, has dreams of a family, and thinks maybe I can survive this. The other part sees no hope. No escape from this disease. And I wish the positive part would win, but honestly I think the depression will eventually win. Even with meds mostly working, I cant escape this feeling of hopelessness and despair. And the depression part wants to win, wants me to give up. And it is so tempting. The fight is hard and I just want the pain to end. I feel so alone. My depression is just a burden to others.

I would like to accept myself and be okay and help others and creat stuff but my hatred prevents that from happening. I think my hatred has the same root as my depression: a lack of social interaction on a meaningful level. I feel very alone and excluded. I feel that I do not fit in. I am probably good at adapting and politeness thus I have a few colleagues with wome I can hang out from time to time. But these relationships feel not too close. I would rather have someone  to whom I really feel close and intimate. It is like being trapped in a glass cube and put in a park full of people. Seeing them having fun and social interaction, seemingly meaningful, is very mean since I can not reach this state and just have to watch. I think this lack is also due to my looks. I am very skinny and only average height, I suppose that is really not desired in a male. Therefore I begun to hate and reject myself. Also because I am not really talented in making conversation, finding new friends and just in general having social interactions. I am also shy and it always feels weird to talk to people.

Wanting to..,"
My depression feels overwhelming right now and I'm not sure what to do for it. I've tried most medications and combinations of meds for depression/anxiety, therapy doesn't help in the slightest and is expensive, I don't get much out of groups, and hospitals only taught me how to hide it better.... I've also tried hobbies, walks, and things to distract myself (weed edibles, phone, and as of recently self harm...). I know my shits getting bad but I genuinely feel like nothing is going to make it better..

I've tried focusing on little things for sources of joy as well but the bits of happiness don't last very long. I might have some slice of happiness for 10 seconds then it's gone because dred takes over. I can't really enjoy anything..

I honestly wish I could purchase a gun but I'm unable to because in the state I'm in you have to have not been admitted to a mental hospital for the past 5 years; I was in one in 2020. At this point I feel like im either waiting until late 2025 or until I'm overwhelmed to the point where physical pain doesn't stop me...

tired of feeling anxious,"there’s this underlying anxiety that I live with all the time and it exhausts me. anxiety and guilt colour all of my friendships and relationships, even the most loving and secure ones. it’s just the worst, I don’t know how to tell my best friends or family members about the intrusive thoughts I get about my relationships with them, ie, even when things are going well I feel like I need reassurance that they don’t hate me or they won’t leave me. i feel like I’ve intellectualized/figured out my issues so much that they should just go away on their own but that’s not how it really works. 

i don’t know what to do to fix it, I’m not sure if I have BPD or bipolar II or something else. I have never qualified for an MDD diagnosis so I haven’t been able to be referred to a psychiatrist even though I’ve been intensely suicidal multiple times in my life and would really like some professional help or medication or something. all I can do right now is take care of myself the best I can but I just wish I knew what more to do.

I am sorry if I sound like a fool, but I just need to speak about this. I’m so sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this and I will take the post down immediately if necessary. 

I used to have a lot of talent when I was young. I practiced piano, soccer, and art. I had so many interests and hobbies that set me apart from the others. However, I gradually stopped doing whatever I was good at because I ""didn't enjoy it."" I have now realized it's biting me in the ass.

Mom doesn’t believe in my depression,"I’m here, still. I’ve been doing as good as I can but even though I haven’t been diagnosed by a professional I am almost certain I have depression. So here’s my story and some of what I feel. Some days I don’t want to get out of bed, I’m starting to hate some of the things I’ve loved since as long as I can remember. I think I got depression at around 11 or 12. When I moved out of my old neighborhood and switched schools so I was away from most of my friends. All I remember from the moving process is a lot of crying, living in a basement with my mom and at the time former step dad who was a functioning alcoholic. They recently divorced at the time but still lived together he didn’t leave until I was 15 but they married when I was 8. Then when I was 13,  I started having a very short temper, often having fits and breaking things and running away from home trying to go back to my neighborhood to see my friends, even though I returned to my old school things changed, I realized nobody there cared about me much and all I had to keep me happy was video games which my mom and school threatened to take away my Xbox. When I was 14, in summer school I started a joke, and I became popular and things were doing so well, I was on the road to recovery and then it all fell apart, I became a huge target for bullying, nobody thought I was funny anymore, and I left after 8th grade. Then my grandfather, who was one of my main father figures and my best friend died. When I was 15 I made a desperate attempt to save my life long dream, but by 16 my mom killed it. Then my uncle who was my other father figure died. At that same time I was being bullied and harassed constantly online. This past year, at my yearly checkup at the doctors she offered me a depression test, before I had a chance to say yes my mom said I was fine and the doctor left the room. I asked my mom why she would do that and she said everyone has depression and we all “get over it.” All they’ll do is make you take pills that do nothing for you, and that we choose to be depressed so I should quit bitching. I have trouble conversating with new people because I don’t trust them, I don’t shower very often or brush my teeth and she sort of makes fun of me by telling me I smell. I’m almost 18 and she doesn’t want to help me get a drivers license. I look in the mirror and just want to punch myself. I have more friends online then I do irl. I have to either sleep in bed with the dogs and my mom, or on the couch because she let my aunt and little cousin have my room. When I can I’m going straight to treat ment, but she’s making it hard because most of the money I earn from work she withdraws to pay her bills. I’m honestly done with my life and I’ll probably be gone within the next decade if I can’t fix it.",Salt-Valuable8639,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgn2gt/mom_doesnt_believe_in_my_depression/
My life story and the reason why my depression started.,"I am gonna share my life bc I have nothing better to do right now. So my (16f) first tragic moment I remember is when my two-year-old brother died when I was almost 5. He died in an accident. At that age, I wasn't really aware of what death was but still, I remember being sad and crying a lot. I still feel sad when I remember our moments together. 

Then later in my life, I got bullied in school when I was around 9-10 years old for literally no reason(I was protecting myself from that assholes but yeah I still got bullied). Then later through middle school, I had some problems with my relationship with friends but nothing important still friends with them. 

Then when I was 13 I and my family moved to another country where I didn't know the language(I still live there). It was pretty hard to leave everything behind. And that is when things got shitty. 

So it was the middle of the school semester of 7th grade. Shortly I was ripping my ass off to learn the language but bc of it was so hard I was learning slow and basically, I wasn't understanding anything and couldn't speak (It is like being deaf and not being able to speak, yeah I was hearing but not understanding). It was so hard to communicate, I was so lonely. Every fucking day I was watching everyone laugh at each other and spend time with each other. I was so lonely, lessons were hard and it was whole another culture. It was the worst time of my life. I had no one to talk to. My parents were asking me how I was doing but I kept telling them lies to don't make them sad. So it was like that for about 2 years. 

Then I started high school which was 2 years ago I taught things would get better but no I was wrong. That was when my depression started. Even though I was better at speaking the language I was learning, it was still not enough and I was having communication problems(Which I still do from time to time) and still kinda lonely at high school as well. I met with new people last year (no in the school) but I feel like they don't actually like me that much. They rarely invite me to hang out with them. 

So yeah also for the last year I am constantly thinking about dying. I am not brave enough to kill myself but I would like to die in an accident or maybe in my sleep it would be so peaceful I think. 

I think my biggest problem is I can't get over what happened in the past. Nothing brings me joy in life. I constantly feel sad and alone sometimes completely numb. 

That was it I guess.

Desensitized or what?,"So all my life I never had many friends. When I did make friends we were  close. I had two close friends before moving to a new state. Sadly my peak friend count was middle school. I had two best friends coming out of high school- 2 friend coincidence? but now it’s one and we check in on each other every couple months or weeks and I try to see them but I’m almost certain they just feel bad for me and don’t actually intend on getting close again. 
My family is quite toxic &amp; I never became close with them either. I’m 25 now for context. I believe my parents and sibling are  narcissistic. When I had a therapist (I did a better help trial) they said I’m not one because I asked if I was and “narcissists wouldn’t be as self aware.” 🤷🏽‍♀️ as for my family, at the very least they have a god complex. They’ve always made me feel bad about myself. I usually see the rest of my family every 2 years fir holidays but we’re all distant a lot of them don’t think the best of me because of my parents. It’s hard to give a real insight to my struggles with all the story gaps. 

Anyway I could go into detail about it all but I’m already getting carried away. I struggle with rejection/paranoia and I’m certain I have anxiety and depression. I’ve struggled with not making any new meaningful connections for 5+ years now. I’ve become so impulsive and am in credit debt. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was young so I think it had a lot to do with their development. If I didn’t have my partner idk what my life would’ve ended up like today. Over the past year we both addressed our addiction to weed. I’m gonna try and hold myself accountable to not smoking anymore with hopes of getting a real job this fall. Goal is not going back to it  for at least 30 days! My partner has their own set of mental struggles but I think  isn’t as bad as I in some ways Luckily they’ve h grown up with 99% of their friends. I tried blending into their circle but it’s gotten hard to ignore their judgment they see me as a spoiled kid I think. I’m just there as a rag along and it’s hard to ignore their remakes and talking to my partner  in the past about it made me feel paranoid and afraid to make matters worse by confrontation. But that just makes breaking points like it has 
I look to YT for most of my free time or end up sleeping most of the day when I’m alone. Seeing other ideal relationships makes me hope that someday I this will be in the past. It’s gotten worse this summer since I’m out of college for the first time in like 7 years . I hide in my room a lot which I hate but I really appreciate it too. His year I made progress in some ways like taking to a few acquaintances in work vs my last job where a bunch of kids used to bully me. I used to cry  on and off just thinking about how my life has turned out but now I feel stuck in my ways like it’s safe, guarded, cold at times, I lost social skills, and at times I’m unbothered by it.  I don’t have the drive like I used to but. For school I was able to  push myself towards the end

I have a hard time thinking about how to ask for this or even if I need it. Is that normal? Or am I just wanting to be babied? Does anyone have a similar experience or insight on what might be a healthy way to deal with that or ask for support?",snoejreu,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgcalg/i_want_to_be_treated_like_im_depressed_does_that/
"I hate change, I hate the cycle of life, I hate everything about how the universe works. What's the point of anything when it always gets taken away and there's nothing you can do","I guess part of my problem is that you absolutely never can fucking rely on anything, people will stab you in the back no matter what they fucking say, friends cone and go, good times are here and gone and then it's back to misery. Misery is the only fucking bedrock there is, it's the only thing that will never fucking go away while friends and family and security can be torn away whenever life decides. And you're supposed to just fucking accept it and be an adult and blah fucking blah. How the fuck am I EVER supposed to accept this? Will death bring me peace?

no hope,"I'm going to share this because no one can understands me or going judge or something even my parents really don't understand my feelings. So here I'm just posting this because i feel so much heaviness on my chest and weird sharp pain in my head and stomach.
Well my childhood was so violent and traumatic. My mother used to beat me to the death. But i know what's the problem with my mom. She was having too mentally ill after her marriage. So all the frustrations and her aggression put down on me. But after that intense time, she's used to bring me my some favorite dishes. But still that toxic taunts and her madness always roaming around in my head. That time it really doesn't matter to me cz i thought its normal as a Asian child. But when i asked some people and my friends about how their parents beat them, they told me its a spank nothing else. I was shocked, felt too heaviness in my heart at that time. I always thought WHY ONLY ME?
Then worse things started to happen in 2021. I used to be alone all the times, family taunts me that I'm lazy bla bla bla. I lost my appetite. I lost my interest in sketching and editing. I was feeling so numb just wanted to die. Daily at 2-3 am i cry for some reason or for no reason. Friends used to make fun of me. Then i learnt my lesson and never shared anything to them. And now its 2022 August still I'm not mentally stable even i harm myself, cut my wrist and smash my head over the wall.
And i failed in a subject because - i don't know. I'm stupid. I used to be a good student. Trauma and bad memories making it more worse and worse. Antidepressants really don't works on me. Mood swings aggression numb feeling the sharp pain. Bruh I'm tired of all these things i just wanted to end this please i don't want to suffer anymore

Lost and Confused,"I haven’t expressed myself in a very long time so forgive me if it sounds like I’m all over the place. Ever since I was about halfway through high school I have been intensely depressed and it has been that way for about 5 years now. I’ve had a relationship that ended harshly which started it all and it spiraled downhill from there. I’ve had “friends” but they were never really there or understanding of the stuff I’ve been through. This is why I feel like loneliness is a huge contributor to my depression, whenever something happens I have literally nobody to talk to so it all kinda bottles up inside me. I don’t know where to take my life and it feels like I’m running out of time. I work a lot so that also takes a big toll on me. Sometimes I feel like being with someone would make me feel a bit better but I’m nervous to take my feelings too far because of my first relationship and it kind of makes me feel shitty because I have my eyes on someone right now but again, I’m too nervous to take it further. Anyways, I don’t really know what I’m expecting from posting this and I’ll probably end up deleting it but it somewhat feels good talking about it.

Meds and therapy help,"Firstly I apologize for the rant because it’s kind of a lot 

I have been struggling with my mental health since I was 8 or 9, now 21. I had my first child a year ago and postpartum hit me hard. I became extremely depressed, began to struggle with weed and pills and was hospitalized twice, once for a suicide attempt. 
I had to leave my job due to the state of my mental health with it being a high stress environment. 

I can’t get insurance anywhere until open enrollment, no online depression sites will help me or accept me because my depression is “too extreme and in person doctor is recommended” I have literally tried everything to get insurance so I can get back on meds and go to therapy. Denied for Medicaid and denied for a SEP through marketplace. I feel like I just want to die. I’m sober and trying so hard to stay positive but I’m so depressed. I exercise, eat healthy, work, meditate, journal, spend time with my baby and try to be the best mom but I still feel this way. I have no family I can reach out to because they’re all struggling with addiction and need help themselves. 
Does anyone have any advice on getting meds and therapy? I’ll pay whatever I’d I need to.

I’m nothing more than a tool for other peoples happiness.,"I go out of my way to make everyone around me happy. I’m the happy go lucky friend to everyone. What people don’t know is how much I hurt on the inside and I can’t figure out how to express it. Someone has a bad day and I’m the guy people vent to, got in to it with a spouse, I’ll lend you a shoulder to cry on. I’ve put myself in such a situation that I feel like I’m not aloud to be the one that’s hurt. I have to be strong so others can survive. 

My best friend of 25 years was the only one who knew how much I truly hurt on the inside and in the end it was that same person who hurt me the most. 

Another really close friend of mine committed suicide on my birthday a few years ago. I had always been there for him in the past with his suicidal thoughts and talked him out of it many times. The night before my birthday he text me looking for my help again. I was so tired of being the guy trying to help others and I told myself “if he hasn’t done it yet, he’s not going to now.” The news was broken to me the next day. 

I’ve had so many people tell me that it’s not my fault, but they don’t know that pain, they don’t know that guilt that I carry every day of my life. Telling me it’s not my fault doesn’t help because that’s other peoples opinions. It’s not going to change my own. 

Ever since then I’ve been nothing more than a stepping stone to everyone I know. I’ll mask my pain and do my happy song and dance for you because something mildly inconvenienced you. How am I doing you say? Oh I’m doing just great I’m always here to help..

I’m not suicidal in any way shape or form but every day I realize I’d rather die than keep living my life as everyones emotional door mat.

I realised one of the major reasons I’m depressed…,"And it hit me from a really good friend sending me an old photo.

I went back on our ‘see friendship’ thing on Facebook to find photos to send her and I found myself automatically smiling. We met 10+ years ago (when I was 19) and we were so present in each other’s lives up until around the pandemic time.

Life felt more carefree (partially due to age I suppose), we would joke about stupid stuff way more and we had so much time to be present for one another.

I was so happy at university compared to now (even though I still had some mental health problems). I’ve realised more recently that it’s because I had a sense of community. I lived with my friends and had a rich, consistent social life with people I grew so close to (because we were so present for one another most days).

I’ve felt so incredibly empty and depressed recently. 

The more real adult life progressed, the more friends became busy with career, family and partner commitments. I ended up relying on my partner way too much and when I left him 6 months ago, I’ve been left with an empty feeling ever since.

I’m trying to learn to enjoy my own company and it’s definitely getting a bit easier and I appreciate myself so much more. But I long so desperately for that sense of community I once had. Texting friends about more mundane stuff and then meeting up every 2-4 weeks is so unfulfilling. Virtual/online connection does hardly anything for me. We are still good friends, but that connected, truly comfortable feeling has faded… the kind of feeling you get from true community. We’re all too focused on what modern society tells you/requires you to be focused on to truly connect. I’m almost 30 so it’s getting even worse due to people wanting/trying for children.

Community is so important and I really do think it’s a huge contributor to why so many people are horribly depressed nowadays. Even when I think back to the 90s/2000s, people seemed more connected… even the adults in my life with one another. I feel really fortunate to have grown up for part of my childhood without the kind of intense social media/technological landscape we have now.

I am SO thirsty to be part of something. To have purpose… to create… to learn and experience something with others. To have real HUMAN, normal bonds… not whatever this post-pandemic weirdness is. It’s so unhealthy.

Community is out there, but I think we have to search harder and fight much more for it. You have to really put yourself out there and join some kind of club, cause or group. The kind of pre-set communities like neighbourhoods, churches etc. just don’t exist in the same way anymore.

We’re so damn individualistic… and I’m tired. The more I sit in my home office working and only having proper contact with my housemates most days, the more I feel my empathy and ‘humanness’ depleting. No more… I’m getting myself out there even if it requires joining 5 damn clubs and going bankrupt in the process.

Community… that’s what’s missing.",sapphiresummer,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg5y2u/i_realised_one_of_the_major_reasons_im_depressed/

So i have a problem were i spend most my time day dreaming about things i want to do but in reality i know will not happen. Why do i keep doing it though? Is it depression?? (I do take meds for depression and anxiety but i dont feel depressed generally atm)

To elaborate, i sit and think id go to the gym, work out and sign up for some charity MMA fight in a years time (which id really like to do), i just dont do it tho, so why do i keep thinking i will.

Or another thing... Id like to have a go at trying to DJ (Not professionally) for fun at home for something to do. Again though, i just dont! I day dream about it but i no il never bother. Il just get up, go to work, come home, eat, play with kids, then sleep and repeat.

I think about doing things for years tho 🤣 but never take action so why do i keep thinking i will haha. How do i just stop with any thoughts on doing things and get on with the actual life i have?

self harm thoughts,"Cw: descriptions of mutilation

Preface: I haven't done self harm and I probably won't, being scared of pain has its upsides

This is mostly to help me understand this and to maybe mitigate some of this

For a while now I have had very vivid thoughts of mutilating myself, stuff like carving the flesh off my arms until only bone remains or stabbing myself until only gore remains. I haven't done this and probably won't but whenever I have the thoughts I kind of want to, mostly because I feel happy beyond reason in the thoughts. 
So I wanted to ask if anyone else experiences this and how to lessen the thoughts, I like feeling a shred of happiness but I'd rather not be lured into self harm this way, nor is it particularly good for my mental health, whatever may be left of that.",kuyani,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgn1ce/self_harm_thoughts/

Depersonalizing/derealization from getting too attached to TV show?,"Does anyone get depersonalization/derealization from getting too involved in a TV show or movie? This has happened to me before in the past but this time, I got really obsessed with a drama series (sci-fi thriller series) and got really connected to the characters and plot. So much that I started to wish I existed in that world and started to imagine myself interacting with those characters and involved in those plot lines.  It made me really sad because I know it’s not real and I obviously can’t do that. Coming back to my own reality it’s like I’m missing something that I never had. Life doesn’t seem as fun and interesting and magical (the series itself is pretty dark but it’s eventful.) It makes me feel like I want to go on a big adventure or be the hero in a story and I can’t. It makes me feel trapped in my body and reality, and also makes me start to question reality and who I am. I start to imagine myself in different realities and get more and more dissociative. Things in my current world become “not enough” and I feel empty and lonely for something that isn’t real and I never was a part of. 

I have to take a break from the show for a while to disconnect. But currently just experienced a meltdown crying on my couch and intermittently zoning out for minutes at a time feeling really scared not knowing what’s real or who I am. 

Has anyone else had experiences like this? Why is this happening? I hate this feeling and just want it to go away. But it’s like I can’t get my mind off the show and every time I think about it the depersonalization and sadness comes back. 😥",Ange_bear,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgi4yk/depersonalizingderealization_from_getting_too/

I get it, there's therapy but for me, personally, as a human and not a statistic or a problem to be fixed.....

Nothing will help. People understand depression and anxiety and PTSD. No one truly understands BPD, not even health professionals and not even people who have it. 

When you try to explain that you destroyed your own life for no reason...I mean, no one will ever have any sympathy or understanding. I don't even know how to fucking explain it right now. What sympathy can anyone have for a person who is, well, abusive? 

The worst part is knowing that no one in my life actually loves me, they just have some irrational emotional attachment and are actually afraid of me because I could flip out at any moment.


I guess the only part I can really put into words is that happiness doesn't exist, people call it the hollow or the empty feeling. No matter where I go, what I do, or who I'm with, it will not fill me or make me happy.

3. I have zero friends.

4. I'm still living at home.

5. I need attention. Some attention. Just *something*. But I'm just a random dude walking by, a nobody.

After years of trying, and after years of reading self-help books, I know it's not going to be better for me.

I gave it a fair chance. After 10 years of still not having my act together, I see no other way than end it.

I have to. I can't keep on living the same day every time.

""Rob a bank."" Yeah, I know. I know. Just *do something different* right? I know. But my mind already knows that it doesn't matter. All of the things I might do differently or improve: it does not matter.

I helped others. I *lived for* others. Doesn't help. After a while, they take it for granted. And you become a doormat, a pushover, a friendly guy.

I hate my life. I've seen enough.

I'm not going to kill myself right away, but *am* going to do so in a couple of days.

When will it all be over,"I'm going through a divorce. We have kids and I have an awful on call work schedule. She's fighting me because she wants me to get them only on the weekends. It kills me because I miss them. Everything was amicable. I cheated years ago. Then she decided to cheat and keep cheating 5 years later. I threw in the towel. We decided on divorce. I started to date months later and she flipped out. Using the kids against me is all she has. I've been in therapy and met an amazing woman. Now I'm struggling with her. We've both been through bad relationships. But after therapy I stopped holding everything in... Now it feels like a mistake. I use to close off in arguments and try to keep the peace. I found someone I could be honest with and it's great. But I find that when I share too much I almost just want to tell myself stop talking too much.

I don't talk to other family members other than my older sister who's a big mess herself with about 20 medical conditions that trump whatever is going on in my life. My kids are confused and want me to change my job. My ex had them meet the man that she cheated on me with and broke up his own marriage. I don't drink to cope, can't do drugs because of my job. I've learned coping skills but it just feels like too much some days. I want to be free to tell my ex how I really feel but she can use that against me. I want to tell the girl I'm with that I'm so happy with her but also terrified. And my ex put down our family dog we had for 13yrs while I was at work. She was sick, but I wanted to be there. I just want to yell sometimes, just stop! I'm working on call and going in on an average of 15hrs of being home. No days off. What am I doing. I have to be strong for my kids.

I can hear and feel my heart beating loudly, my chest aches at times. Every moment spent with my eyes open is like torture to me. Debt is looming over my family, money is running out, grandma's in the ICU, mom's hospital bills is piling up. And I'm missing my dad more and more since the day he passed. 

I told my mom and siblings that I don't want to celebrate my birthday, they don't need to celebrate my birthday. Deep down inside, I don't want to waste money. I mean these days, I've been trying to spend less by eating only once a day. But at the end they surprised me with a birthday cake. I cried instantly. And couldn't stop crying. I blew the candles. I cut the cake. And I feed the cake to my mom and my little sisters. I hugged my mom tightly. They were trying to comfort me, repeatedly saying don't cry. But I can't stop. I don't want them to worry so I told them it was tears of happiness.

"my life is not exhausting, but i'm exhausted.","i'm (19F) been having a depressive episode for almost a week, and i am so exhausted. i rarely have genuine long conversations with my boyfriend (26M) as our relationship tends to be him giving into my needs/wants and understanding each other's likes and dislikes. we've formed somewhat of a routine that we are content with. a couple of hours ago we were about to go to bed on facetime, i told him that i didn't feel like attending school. for context, i am about to begin my final year of diploma in mid-august, and my bf is beginning his 2nd year. we've had 3 months of break prior to the upcoming semester. anyway... taking a gap year has been on my mind for a few months, but i was and still am afraid to do so before graduating, as i have never had such a long break. it was primary school, straight to secondary school, straight to my current college. he replied that i should persevere a little while more and complete my diploma. of course that's the ideal situation, but i am afraid that i'm already feeling so depressed/tired/suicidal now, what more when i'm under high stress?

nowadays my daily schedule is to wake up at around 1-2pm, sigh, use my phone to order food delivery for lunch, stay in bed until the food comes then have lunch. afterwards i would take a shower, sit at my table and watch youtube until it's 6.30pm. time to order food for dinner. i watch shows until i finish dinner, shower again, watch more shows and go to bed on facetime with my bf at about 1am. i would then mute myself and go on tiktok while he sleeps, until i'm able to fall asleep at (usually) about 4am. 

why is everything so tiring? literally from the moment i wake up to the moment i sleep, i'm dreading everything in between and more. i'm worried about the future - my upcoming semester, my finances, my relationship, my parents, etc. i told my boyfriend all this earlier and he doesn't seem to understand my point of view. i know he is desparate in trying to be in my shoes, but i'm not sure how to explain it to him. i told him that to me, staying alive is like a bothersome chore that i don't like to do, but it's necessary. his reply to that is ""just think - if you die, i'll be all alone in this world."" and that makes me cry my heart out. 

as i'm writing this post, i've stopped bawling and i think i'm thinking logically. i'm depressed and i have been depressed for a really long time, and honestly it feels like life is not worth living anymore. yes i love my boyfriend with all my heart and i would hate to leave him with all the trauma. but i'm feeling too much pain and emptiness every day, and it makes me feel helpless.

I’ve started to realize just how much anxiety I have. My depression and anxiety is starting to affect my relationship and honestly I don’t know what to do. I was sexually assaulted as a child and growing up it affected me but once I learned to accept what happened and was able to talk about it as I got older without crying that was a relief. I thought it would stop there. But I’ve started to realize just how much it has affected me as a person. I can’t trust anyone. I doubt peoples love. I’ve always imaged the bad things that could go wrong in my life because to me it’s like I don’t deserve happiness…I always think that all good things are too good to be true. My bf who I love with my whole heart is even getting annoyed with me. I feel alone although I know I am not… I’m just very lost right now.

A question about Anger and being mean,"So I’ve been searching for this for a while and have turned up nothing.

Is feeling more outright Anger a sign of becoming less depressed? 

Like is that a sign of being less numb and sad? 

Anger is a separate emotion from those things, a more extroverted one that makes you speak out and things as well as can make you feel a strange sensation in your throat and stomach similar to butterflies.

I don’t like being Angry because it causes me to be rude towards people and possibly hurt their feelings and I hate that I’ve been doing that recently but I’m just curious if it’s a sign of lifting depression, like is it a good thing or a bad thing?

I’m working on stopping myself from blurting out things or shooting people dirty looks because it’s so mean feeling but I’m hopeful it’s a possible sign that I’m becoming less depressed, I would really like if someone could answer this

What Does It Mean When Someone WANTS To Be Depressed? Trying To Understand...,"TW: Discussion of attempt

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to be empathetic and help someone I care about very much. I just don't understand. Hoping someone had a name for this or had experience with it or something - I'm lost!

I understand being depressed and desperately wanting to get better - I can also understand being depressed and feeling completely hopeless and helpless - I can understand feeling like you deserve to be depressed - but I cannot understand what my person is going through - they WANT to be miserable and depressed?? They do not have the exhaustion you get from depression - they are making the conscious choice to not exercise, eat decent meals, etc.

And when we try to help them they go on these long tangents about complicated math/psychology/philosophy/science which I think is an attempt to prove that they are smarter than us. They will also curse at us and tell us to not contact them. They are mean and treat us really badly. During a visit before things got this bad they told me literally that ""being unhappy makes them happy"" and that they ""want to be unhappy"". They are in the hospital now after an attempt... our worst nightmare that we wait on edge for every day to get that call... It was obvious to everyone who saw how they set up this attempt that it was done deliberately so that they would survive, that someone would find them in time, and details were given on how to save them were written out. So it looks like it was done to get attention? Like a cry for help?  But at the same time when you try to help them it's like they will do everything possible to not let you help them. And I mean - if they truly wanted to be miserable why would they attempt? They had exactly what they said they wanted?

I want to be clear that we are trying our best to be patient, kind, and to understand them - we don't tell them what they should do and instead have been trying to ask questions to figure out what the core issue is to get them help that will actually help. But all of these attempts have failed. They just go on and on about socrates and the calculus of the universe or something. Or are so cruel and tell us we're stupid.

I was willing and wanted to do anything he wanted to keep me in his life. But that wasn’t enough. He didn’t think I could be happy with him. I assure you he was wrong. It was so easy to give up on me even after giving him all of my love. After being there for him in all ways I could at any given point and vice versa. That’s how valuable I am.

I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I feel like I’m going fucking crazy. I have severe ocd and I’ve been really struggling lately specifically with false memory. About a week ago I had ONE beer left so I drank it and I got freaked out that i commented on one of my favorite bands Instagram something really fucking horrible. Like really really bad. It made it worse when I looked it up and found out you can get drunk off one beer. I just started drinking not even a year ago and don’t do it super often so I don’t have much experience. This has been bothering me ever since then. I’m really scared I’m doing things subconsciously sober or not. Like just now I took my nasal spray out of my pocket to put some nasal spray in and two minutes later I was about to do it again bc I forgot I did it. Then I remembered I already did it. I’ve not been able to decipher real memories from false memories and it’s one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced. I just wanna break down and cry but I can’t bc one of my medicines side effects prevents me from crying. To add to all this I’m extremely lonely I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have a “second life” that I pretend I’m in where I’m dating this girl that doesn’t even know me in real life and it makes me really really sad when I get back to reality. But I can deal with being lonely. I can’t deal with the ocd bc it literally feels like it’s gonna make me do something I regret. I don’t want to die (mostly) but I also feel that if I died in a car crash or died in my sleep that it would be ok. And much longer of this I’m gonna wanna die.

Everyone always acts so fake at work and talk behind your back. I am already looking for something new but not finding anything soon is just giving me anxiety and then I fall into depression. 

I am used to it by now. I try to be happy and cheerful and for a while it works till I realise the true colours of my coworkers and the company. It’s always the same. And then I just hit an end and fall I go depression. 

Maybe I am just not numb and dumb enough to not look through all those happy fake people. Being smart never helped me with anything besides getting jobs easier.

How do i help someone i can't understand ?,"My brother and a friend of mine are both depressed and I have no idea to how I can help them. I always helped people with their problem, but for me it's impossible to help someone without understanding the problem. 
So one day as we were eating at a restaurant with some other friend we talked about depression and nihilism and as we were talking i tried to bring  in the conversation a female friend who suffer from depression. She evaded the conversation and I've been told to be an idiot for asking directly.
 But my question is how do you help someone you can't comprehend ? I have observed my brother for a long time without ever coming close to understand how to help him. I don't know if when we talk I am helping him or hurting him. So i figuered to ask directly to someone with the same disorder.

Is it right risking to hurt someone to help them or should I mind my own bisness and let them andle it by them selves?",some_one_alex,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgi1yj/how_do_i_help_someone_i_cant_understand/

Angry at life,"I am angry at being alive. I have nobody to tell this to. I don't really want to burden my friends or family with the knowledge that I hate existing, because it feels to me like then they will feel the need to take some action to help me feel better, which honestly I don't want and there's really nothing anyone can say to help. I guess I just need to get it off my chest. 
I wake up every morning at 5:30. I do my morning chores of taking care of my pets and then I go to work. I deal with assholes all day who treat me less than human for a job that while sometimes can be tolerable, is mainly hot, hard, work that leaves me in crippling pain nightly. I work my (most of the time) 10 hour day. Go home, do my evening chores, again taking care of the pets, make dinner, watch tv, take a shower, go to bed. Repeat. On the few days I have off, I clean the house or run errands. I don't find joy in day to day existence and honestly can't find reason for anything. We are meat puppets used by corporations for as long as possible until either we wear out and are physically unable to do the job or we die. If you're one of the ""lucky"" ones and somehow manage to find a way to exist well enough below your income that you can afford to save money, you MIGHT get to retire one day. The good news is though, while you're working, your glorious corporation gives you two whole weeks that you can do whatever you choose. So basically, you give up 40 hours of your waking time every week and you get two fucking weeks out of the whole god damn year of your life to use as you see fit. And around we go again until we die. The worst part is knowing this and knowing that there's literally no way out of it. Even if you win the lottery or create a start up, you still live within the framework that dictates that you have to earn money by using your time and body in exchange to continue exist. There is no escape from it. I guess I could learn some survival skills, get rid of all of my unnecessary possessions, and disappear into the forest, but even still, at some point I may need medical attention or something else that requires I have some form of financial means. I feel so trapped and for what? What exactly do I get out of being alive? There's no punchline. I feel like I'm constantly waiting for some sort of reason to come to me so I can have that ""aha"" moment and finally understand how people continue to exist every day.",Beneficial_Sky_2082,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgchhl/angry_at_life/
Just a dump of everything that’s been happening lately because it felt nice to type it out instead of keeping it in my head,"Feels like I’m constantly about to burst. I stay up all night praying for an end know damn well I don’t don’t believe in a god. I lie to everyone including myself about everything because my trust issues are fucking abominable. I terrified of any kind of rejection even thinking about getting told no to a simple question is enough to make me have a panic attack. I sometimes go entire days with talking to even myself because I feel what I have to say isn’t important in the slightest. I’m about 3 months clean from self harm but at least once a week I’ll hold a razor blade to my arm while begging myself to do it and not do it at the same time. I genuinely believe everyone around me hates me and is annoyed by my mere presence. I’ve cried myself to sleep almost every night for about 3 or 4 months now. I don’t have any kind of escape or anyone to talk to. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. The second I try to do anything positive or better myself I tell myself that I don’t deserve it, that I should know my place because “who do I think I am?”. Sometimes when my life seems like it’s actually going well, I fuck it up on purpose because being sad is easier. I deny that I’m trans despite not being able to go outside somedays as even seeing a girl makes me want to kill my self because oh how I wish I were born a girl. Every that I think I’d feel comfortable enough to open up to always leaves with no warning. I hate myself for being so pitiful and not even attempting to do anything to fix my life. I feel like a leech I never work for anything and I constantly bring down those around me. I hate that I get overly attached to anyone that even slightly treats me like a person because it hurts so much more when they’re leave, yet I keep doing it. I was gonna kill my self back in may but I ended up not being able to take that last step off the 11th story so I’ve just been empty and lost since then.

What are some of the reasons why I shouldn’t end my life?,"Hi, I’m a 19 years old guy and I’ve always struggled with depression. Ever since I was 3 I’d had countless nights of waking up in nightmares, plus my parents fighting didn’t really make things better. In elementary school I was thrown into this program at school called iep “individualized independent education” because it took me a little longer than others to communicate properly. The years I spent in this program was hell, I’d constantly be picked on and treated like an animal from different classes, was told im in the “slow class”. So I’ve always felt lonely, fast forward to freshman year of high school and I was able to get out of the program. It honestly wasn’t that hard making friends after but it’s always been hard dating people. People would often tell me I’m cute but leave me for the “better guy” every time. In junior year in high school I was able to meet this girl from Instagram. We started talking but it turns out she was toxic and mentally abused me. Last year on Valentine’s Day I tried committing suicide from all the loneliness I was feeling . I took around 50 pills total but there was a variety of them. I sat and waited for about 20 mins and finally I was able to feel the affects. I sat on the ground against my mattress, I noticed I couldn’t move my body, my body had been mostly paralyzed. I entered the thoughts of “I’m really going to die” “ I kinda don’t want to die” all of these thoughts started passing through my head and I panicked out of it and was able to call my parents with the little strength I had . They picked up and rushed back home from visiting another city. I was took to the hospital and had an iv until the following morning. I still struggle with being lonely. I never had any sexual experiences the most I got from a girl was a hug. I often think maybe I should just kill myself so everyone can eventually forget about me but I’m scared. I don’t really want to die I just don’t want to feel this lonely and miserable.I can’t really talk to anyone about these problems either because like every time they’ll say “you have nothing to worry about” “ don’t rush it” or “ sex is overrated” but the only reason they can say that is because they’ve already experienced it. I don’t really have anyone to talk to in general. Lately I’ve been trying to do more for myself though, I recently got my drivers license and started working out.

Went to a gun range to kill myself but I couldn’t do it and now I’m ashamed of myself.,"I have very intense PTSD due to childhood sexual abuse by my father. I’ve told my mom about it when I was a child and she got angry at me for telling her about it. I kept bringing it up to her over the years but she doesn’t believe me or support me.

My life is absolute hell and I’m always paranoid because I’m always surrounded by real danger. My mom gaslights me by treating me like I’m crazy, and she looks at me like I’m a threat. I went with her to a gun range (it was my idea) and when I got to my lane, I loaded the gun and began firing shots. When I was ready to “exit” my heart started pounding and I started to sweat a lot.

Every night I say I’m gonna go but when I wake up, I just sit in my car and stare at the lake near my house. Idek if they’re gonna let me back on

Whenever I mention anything about my depression or Suicidal thoughts to anyone I know the only solution they have is to get mad and yell at me.  I'm at such a poor mental state that anyone being nice or mean to me just makes everything worse for me.

I also feel like I'm completely worthless and if any one were to ask me to describe myself it would be the most negative things I can think about at the time.

Anybody plz listen,"I am so miserable. I am 30 years old and wasted the last 10 years of my life with the father of my 3 children thinking he would marry me and wanted to start a future and would contribute to that future. He is 33 and lives with his parents and my kids. I moved out of there 3 years ago and live with my family. The relationship is beyond toxic and I truly don’t want to be with him but I’m so scared to be without him. I have one small room at my family’s home and atleast 15 other people live here. I can barely shower or use the bathroom and I thought they would be more comfortable at their dads where they have their own room and are the only kids. It’s hell I miss my kids but as soon as they come over it’s so overwhelming I almost always take them back the same night. I’m so miserable and fed up with the way our lives have turned out and even how I turned out I constantly work and provide full financial responsibility for our kids and he donates plasma.

I hate disappointing people, I’d rather be shocked with a taser, I just wanna know if I even have depression, if I do how can I

I don't know,"Trying to find anything worth going on for. 

My depression feels overwhelming right now and I'm not sure what to do for it. I've tried most medications and combinations of meds for depression/anxiety, therapy doesn't help in the slightest and is expensive, I don't get much out of groups, and hospitals only taught me how to hide it better.... I've also tried hobbies, walks, and things to distract myself (weed edibles, phone, and as of recently self harm...). I know my shits getting bad but I genuinely feel like nothings going to make it better..

I tried to think of something that i could look forward to so i set a little goal for myself that I thought would be reasonable, to afford a tiny apartment for my cats and I. It's doable if I can get 2-3$ worth of raises in the next few years. However, all my coworkers who have been there for years say that they have never gotten a raise. I enjoy my job because it doesn't give me much of any stress, which I'm surprised by and thankful for. And I'm terrified to try finding another job because I might not last there... I can't handle stress very well especially right now..

I've tried focusing on little things for sources of joy as well but the bits of happiness don't last very long. I might have some slice of feeling happy for 10 seconds, then it's gone because dred takes over.

I honestly wish I could purchase a gun but I'm unable to because in the state I'm in you have to have not been admitted to a mental hospital for the past 5 years; I was in one in 2020.

I feel like I am falling back and I cannot get a grip on myself.,"My excuses beforehand as this may be a long post. Hi, I'm a guy and I'm 23 years old. My life has been a constant battle with myself and the world around me.

At a very young age, I have been diagnosed with Autism. In general, me and the people around me feel like it doesn't really affect me, which I came to doubt. I also have been bullied for most of my life. One of my only friends in person was my nephew living across the street. Even him I now barely see as we grew apart once adult life started and schedules stopped aligning.
From the age of 10, I been diagnosed and struggling with depression. I tried to get through it, but on my 14th I broke and tried to do something stupid, but I couldn't. In that time I was on a high school specifically for autistic people, and via there I got into a mental hospital for treatment. After that one, I went to a second. I been away from home for nearly 2 years for that, and it didnt help. Eventually I learned to help myself, and once I finished high school and started college at thw age of 17, I felt better. College was decent, and even though I struggled through those years and had an amazing persom there to guide me, I still felt lost.

I ended up working in the restaurant business, something I somewhat enjoyed. Then Covid hit. I lost my job, I lost my passion, I lost my girlfriend of 3 years (which ended up being good for me, as it was not a good relationship). 

For the past 2 years, I have been lost. I tried dating, but always felt alone or lost. I couldnt get a proper job and even though I made some online friends in the progress, still I feel alone. I discovered I have Aphantasia and a whole array of mental and physical issues.

Now to my current situation, as Im sitting here overthinking life. The more I type this message, the heavier I feel. My hands feel like bricks hammering at my phone. I feel like I am lost again. I feel like I am scared again. I feel alone and afraid and I do not know what to do. I have a job I enjoy, but due to the current economics it kind of got very silent temporarily. I stand up, go to work, come back, all I want to do is sleep. I pull myself out of bed to eat and force myself to keep doing stuff. I have hobbies I do, as I play DnD on 3 week days. But where I enjoyed this in the beginning, I cannot concentrate on it anymore. I have some online friends and people I am very close with, but it feels like its one sided, wether its true or not. I feel alone and I feel like I bother everyone.
I frequently overthink and overreact, and freak out. I started getting ptsd flashbacks of terrible things and I just shut down. Im already searching for a psychologist, but the waiting lists are extremely long. 

I don't know what more to say. I have trouble feeling and thinking. I only keep going because work is counting on me to show up. Everything outside of works feels like a lot of effort to me, and dare I say, I would be better off alone and not having any obligations to do or see or talk to anyone. But I know I couldnt, and shouldnt. Currently, there is one specisl person in my life. She makes me happy still, whenever she texts me I get happy. Creepy or not, I sometimes look at her photo's because her face and her eyes and her smile makes me smile. But those are the only moments I feel like I enjoy. In fact, those are one of the few rare moments in my life I actually feel emotions. Normally emotions have been a state of mind, a though. I just 'know' I feel something rather then feeling it (I may be a sociopath). But Im afraid to scare her away or lose her, and Im scared to get hurt. Most people in my life have hurt me and I know she is different, but my minds tells me to be scared.

I don't know what to do, where to go, or what I need. I get through life now by spending money on stupid shit I dont even need or use. It doesnt even make me happy when I buy stuff. I just dont want to have money, and I cant be happy, so I prefer making others happy with it. I have no idea where Im going with this post, just a look inside my mind.

I hope there is someone out there who has felt kr been through something similar, and can offer tips or guidance. Anything if welcome at this point, as I lost the light and Im now lost in a dark room.",WhoIsYourDommy,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg97ky/i_feel_like_i_am_falling_back_and_i_cannot_get_a/
"28, At my wits end","This is my first time ever posting in a Reddit forum, and to be honest it makes me really uneasy spilling my darkness even if I’m anonymous. 

As I write this I lay here in bed, end of summer at 2pm. I no longer see the reason in getting up, as at every single corner and every single thing I do or try ends in disappointment. I hope someone can relate, please. 

When I was in my pre/early teens i suffered from severe panic attacks, until I reached about 20 to which it turned into to full blown depersonalization disorder. I was so gone mentally and physically, totally agoraphobic. I was suicidal, not necessarily because of the depression but because I’d simply lost the person I once was. My thoughts, and my appearance- total stranger. 

Once I started going to the bars and being social again it started to subside. I had some decent times but ultimately I’ve been slapped in the face the reality that I never lived my young life, I was never happy. Ive been so unlucky with everything that it’s a running joke with my friends. I’ve never had a girlfriend. Never went to college. I’m reaching 30 and I just so badly want to turn around and live that life. My inner demons have prevented me from all of that. 

My problem is now, because nothing has worked out, I’ve grown so incredibly apathetic. I’m bitter. My therapist essentially gave up on me. He couldn’t figure out how to fix me so he was like idk maybe try acupuncture or something? Wtf. I’m just done.",Other_State5817,52,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfdkri/28_at_my_wits_end/

I have to forget what I am if I ever want a chance of getting out of bed. I’ve been pretty successful in locking myself out of my ego, but this recent week ive felt moments of myself slipping back into terror. I’m so confused at what’s happening. I know This fear is because of my history of repressed suffering and dissociation, but I can’t tell whether this confusion and fear is setting in psychosis or healing mindfulness. I hold no remorse or compassion for myself, neuroticism is all I ever know in relation to my being. Even if I rationalize my psychology I’ll never give myself the benefit of the doubt. Im always irrationally at fault. And everytime I look in the mirror I slip further and further into this confusion and fear.

Attack on Titan has basically kept me alive,"I was planning on killing myself in early 2021 but decided I'd stick it out until the end of Attack on Titan since its final season was airing and I was super invested in it.

Suddenly it reveals that it was only part 1 and part 2 comes out in 2022. I was pissed but also marginally better mentally. Enough that I thought, fuck it, let's stick it out another year because I need to see this. Suddenly it was weirdly easier. Instead of seeing the weight of my future and the unbearable thought of fighting through another 70 or 80 years in this hell, I saw only the year in front of me.

2022 came around and by that point I was in a decent enough place to think, I want to go out with a bang. I decided to have one last push through 2022 and start kicking things off my bucket list. Of course, I was expecting to end it at the end of the year but Attack on Titan then baited me with a part 3 to the final season so now it looks like I'm pushing through the first few months of 2023.

But it's not like I'm not doing better. I'm working 13 hours a week which doesn't sound like much but its all my mental health can handle right now. 

 I wanted to run tough mudder, a marathon and a triathlon all in one year. I had a burst of motivation, worked out heavily for about four months, did tough mudder,and  then fell back into another depressive episode. 

I think I'm coming it out of it now, a little too late because I have a Marathon coming up with only a month to train for it and I've just been laying around for two months.

Feeling Emotionally Burned Out and Don't Know What to Do With Myself?,"Preface (its long but thanks for reading):

These past few months I've been feeling pretty drained emotionally and mentally. I've felt depressed for a long time now but it's really hitting hard now. My childhood pet that I loved like my firstborn child (and the only one who understood me really) passed away and someone I was really close to at work passed away recently. I'm still at home with my parents and siblings working so I can't really afford to talk to a counselor or move out yet and I don't really trust anyone in my family to talk about my problems either.

My mom would just tell me she has problems too and turn the conversation into being about her/venting or saying she's too busy to deal with my issues. My dad works all day and comes home late at night so when I do talk to him I have to do it in a hurry and sometimes I say forget it because I know he's stressed enough and I don't want to add to it. My younger sis is like my mom in some ways, she will listen to me but then when I start talking about my depression the answer is to pray it away and then she talks about her own problems bc she's looking for advice. My bro is in his own world and won't even say hello or ask me how I'm doing when he sees me. And my other bro, who I haven't really spent any time with since elementary school, will only really greet me and talk to my parents and other siblings when he comes around for visits. We have a estranged relationship that I've given up on building a long time ago so I don't think I'll ever feel comfortable sharing anything with him. If I talk to another family member, especially about my mom or family issues, they'll take what I said and spread it as gossip or go back and tell my parents. When I tried telling my pcp about my issues (with my mom in the room), she could only watch in horror as I admitted that I was feeling overly stressed and depressed (something I never admitted to a doctor before but I've dealt with almost my whole life) and then explained to the doctor for me that I'm only feeling that way because I lost my pet and my co worker this year and wouldn't let me elaborate any further because she didn't want the doctor to ""put me on any medication"".

My bff spends most of her time now hanging out with her girlfriend's friends and partying. I always had to initiate calls or hangouts which didn't even feel like quality time together because she was always messaging someone else or not really listening to anything I say. I'm a INFJ so that really hurts to deal with since I'm always there when she needs me for anything and willing to give emotional support too.

Out of everyone in my social circle, she was the only one I could rely on but I didn't do it often because I didn't want to be dependent on her. I used to talk about my problems with her but with her being busy with other people, I haven't really had anyone to vent to or express how I feel (which is hard enough already). I've felt this way before a few years ago and  when I told her I wanted to spend quality time with just her and no one else, I thought she understood what I meant since we haven't had this issue since recently. I was already feeling pretty depressed but when I saw how low of a priority I was on her list to even care about what I have to say, I completely shut down and haven't said anything to her or any of my other not as close friends for over a month because of how hurt I felt.

She asked me if I wanted to celebrate my birthday last month and because of how stressed I am with work, school, and other business I told her that while I appreciated the thought, I didn't want to celebrate this year. I just didn't feel like hanging out while I still felt like this and had these kind of thoughts because I know I'd cover it up the best I could and be ""happy"" so the mood won't be sour. Plus, the death of my pet has really been hard for me to get over and this was the first birthday I experienced without her so it's not really a happy time for me right now.

Tl;dr: I guess you can say I just got tired of feeling like I have to explain how I feel to them when they ask what's wrong with me or if they did something because what's the point if no one is even going to listen or try to help me. Or they hear me out and then get defensive when I say they are a part of the problem. I'm always expected to be there for everyone no matter the situation or how I'm feeling and yet when I need help, I don't really have anyone to turn to which really isn't helping my depression so I've completely shutdown on everyone.

So I guess I just wanted to ask if there was anything I should do? I do plan on paying to see a therapist in the next few months when I start working again but ig I just wanted to know if it was okay to feel burned out after all of this.",hugging_harp_seals,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg7h69/feeling_emotionally_burned_out_and_dont_know_what/

Eh.,"Hey Reddit. This is my last resort to just talking about anything. It’s been a long week. 

For clarification I have been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and PTSD. the past 6 years, and have been struggling for almost 12. I am in therapy every Wednesday.

I have already tried 7 times with my psychiatrist to help me but he doesn’t seem worried about anything I tell him and dismisses me with no change to my treatment.

I have no friends. I have tried talking to people who I think are my friends but then I’m told I’m a p•ssy for going to therapy.

I have had probably the toughest week of the year. My girlfriend broke up with me then I had my car repossessed yesterday morning which takes my last ounce of any freedom I had before.

My family doesn’t seem to care about anything I go through. My parents co-signed on my car knowing full well I couldn’t just buy a car from a dealer alone, which of course resorted to repossession. I am now actively looking for a loan to maybe just pay the car off and make payments to the bank on the loan? I don’t know shit about anything. No one has ever helped me learn how to be a functioning adult, almost 22 and I feel like I’m a joke. I don’t know what to do or how to do anything.

I have already had my father get in my face and yell at me about how do I have PTSD if I have never been to war or had a gun shot at me, I am constantly degraded and mistreated. I cannot move out because of my credit being shit and of course with how this stupid ass country is doing I can’t afford to do anything. Let alone if I stay in this town any longer I might just die.

I’ve just been sitting here, doing nothing, all by myself. No support, no friends. My only friends I feel like I do have are my bearded dragons. But obviously they don’t know what I am talking about but I guess it makes me feel better I can at least talk to another living thing without being told I am wrong or should just take my own life.

I have 2 “friends” from way back when I was in middle school but they don’t ever seem like they care enough. They just resume their conversations without me while I just sit here and get consumed by extremely depressive thoughts.

My now ex and I broke it off mutually. We knew we were mentally not doing so good and that we would still talk to and support each other because down the line it’s possible we could try again because we don’t hate each other and are still very open about wanting to be there for each other even if there is no label in the way.

But I feel embarrassed to try and talk to her because obviously this isn’t only about me and I want to help her too. I’ve become super isolated, I don’t want to eat, drink, or see anyone. So I just lay in my bed staring at the wall for hours until I pass out again.

I have noticed I cannot cry or anything anymore and haven’t been able to for some time. I feel nothing. I have already been admitted into an psychward and do not wish to be there again. Hate it there.",Flshbowl,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg7bgg/eh/

I am so afraid,"I am so afraid. I am so afraid of being around people. I just want to shut myself away. I hate the whole pretence thing I have to do around friends. I dread it when I have to meet up with them, it seems like a chore. 

I am so afraid of the world. I sense that something bad is going to happen, I don’t know what or when, but it just feels inevitable. 

I am so afraid of myself. I am scared that I don’t know how to look after myself properly - I can’t and don’t want to fix my diet, I go days without showering because I can’t bring myself to do it, I wear clothes without washing them because I can’t be bothered to, I don’t look after my teeth properly, I don’t care about my hair and I do nothing with it, my face is covered in spots and I can never seem to get rid of them, I don’t exercise as much as I should, I spend too much time online. I can feel my brain slowing down already and I’m only 19. 

I am afraid of dying, but that is what I think about a lot. I feel so upset when other people who I didn’t really know die, and yet thinking about my own death doesn’t really upset me.

I'm dragging my feet on adequately addressing my mental health.,"I (25f) have been procrastinating on adequately addressing my mental health because I am 100% not wanting to deal with the side effects. I understand that finding the right medication is usually trial and error, but I do not want to go through that. 

I have been perscribed depression medication 3 diffrent times (17,20,22) in my life and each time I experieced mild side effcts that I don't want to deal with. I am sure by the 2-3rd time I started to slack on my dedication to trying them, however still a negative experience for me. I experienced mild mood swings, and , most importantly, libido issues. That is just something I value in my life and do not feel like losing.

That being said, I do feel that having help would make a drastic impact to my life. I feel that if I actually committed to finding something that helped I would be hopeful for the future. I am tired of feeling low even when things in my life are improving.

How to be a caretaker without becoming a punching bag?,"My spouse battles with depression and anxiety on a near constant basis. I try my best to support her in every way she needs (closeness when needed, space when needed, offloading tasks from her todo list, etc)....but there's a pattern that quite frankly is becoming exhausting and overwhelming: she takes her pain out on me verbally and emotionally.

Sometimes she later apologies, sometimes she doesn't, but honestly I don't care about the apologies, I just want there to be less to apologize for.

How do I assert my right to be treated decently without causing her to spiral? I don't feel it's wise to do it in the moment, but when we talk after the fact then it throws her back into a depressive mode (feeling sad and/or defensive...for which she later apologies for, continuing the cycle) which is why I usually just accept it and stay quiet.

I don't feel like im the one living my life,"Sorry for the long text 


I feel like im stuck. Everyday feels the same. I can't enjoy anything anymore. 
Idk how to explain this but i feel like life is just passing by and that my body is doing all those things but im not. I feel like life goes too fast, one second i wake up and the next its night again. I have memories of doing things during the day but it feels blurry and distant. 

I felt like this a lot when i was in 3rd-4th of ESO (14-15yrs old), it started around quarantine, and last year i changed schools and made friends, had people who helped me, i felt more alive and real like it was me who was living this life. 

But now that its summer and i can't go to school Iv'e gone back to this. I don't enjoy life. Its scary. Im not my body. Everything is just a loop. Life goes by too fast and im not able to come back. Its like im not relly controlling it. I feel like its just in auto pilot and im not the one who is living. Im just a mind. But this is not my body nor my life.


I also feel like kinda trapped in dayreaming, im always doing it, there is always someone talking to me, i know its not real, its just a dream, but I can't get out of it.


I hate the idea of sleeping. I feel like i loose more control than ever. My body just decides to sleep whenever it wants to and im scared of never woking up. Of never being able to come back like ive done this year when i was with people i felt accepted and loved. 


I don't know why i feel like this, I have autism, depression and anxiety (tho im not diagnosed with the last two) Im also trans, everyone at school knows, and now that im back home i feel like im someone else, not really me.
Part of this is probably that I don't like my body, and probably why i feel disconnected from it. 


But its scary, i just want my life back, i want to live again, to be myself again and enjoy life, but I can't come back, theres some kind of barrier between my brain and my body and im not me.

"I am 25, feeling empty and lonely. I would like to end up my life sometimes, but I don't have the courage. What would you do if you were me? Besides asking for professional help","I have been living abroad for four years, with a major focus on developing my career. Now I am 25, and I have realized that my life is empty: a lot of my old friendships are getting colder and more distant; I am a different person now and I feel that I don't have that much in common with my old friends as well as with most of my family members anymore.

My life is like a race against the clock, I don't enjoy my days anymore: it's just working. I am a freelance model, therefore I've been traveling for work constantly this year, without a real break. Whenever I wanted to take part in social events, I couldn't because I had to work or recover from physical and mental tiredness.

I'm going to start a new life in Milan next month: I'm going to attend one of the best universities in town, living on my own completely in a nice one-bedroom apartment in the historical center, but I don't feel excited anymore. I am not excited about going out anymore, I don't like eating anymore, I can't find anything interesting in many people anymore...everything is disconnected and irrelevant to me. I am going on holiday to one of the most beautiful and posh places in Tuscany this month, but I still feel stressed out about my job and life.

The only constant company that I've had this year has been myself and the photographers and models with whom I have been working lately...that's all. I am in the middle of my 20s now and wondering if I will ever make any new real friends in the future. Because I have been an expat living abroad for several years, I met just superficial people both as friends and in love as well. 

Today I have just realized that my whole life is just a spare room with nothing inside but cold. The more I get the more I want to achieve, sometimes I just want to end up my life, and, consequently, end my pain and worries. If the world is just a cold and highly competitive place to live with too many mean people, I don't know if I will ever survive.",pink_coffee97,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg6opq/i_am_25_feeling_empty_and_lonely_i_would_like_to/
i want my bf to hate me,"TW for general suicidality

We've had issues with growing apart and a part of me is terrified of that. Spending time with him is one of the few things that stave off the emptiness. But at the same time I want to make him mad and break up, so I'm finally able to end it all without feeling guilty about leaving him. I want him to hate me so much he doesn't need to grieve. He deserves so much better than a festering wound for a boyfriend and I hate that I can't give that to him, so the next best option is to save him from myself. 

I love him more than I can put into words but I make too many mistakes. Sometimes I wonder if he talks about me to his friends, and I hope that maybe he's already on his way out. The last thing I want to do is hurt him but it's all I seem capable of.",spook_worm,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wgc1tv/i_want_my_bf_to_hate_me/
Wrote a suicide note last night,"The last few days have been incredibly hard for me, having extreme anxiety attacks, unable to get up In the morning and  feeling the most depressed since I can remember. Suicide had never been on the table for me but I just so tired of my anxiety, like when it's to the point I'm scared to answer the door/phone or go somewhere new like how do I have any chance in life. I'm honestly just too weak to effectively deal with the struggles of life. 

So I spent last night, listening to my favourite songs typing out a suicide note in my notes page on my phone. It was oddly freeing to be able to just write my feelings down, thanking each of my family members for being amazing and being incredibly loving. Expressing my reasons and the issues I had been hiding from them and asking for forgiveness for being so selfish. Letting them know it was no one's fault but mine and I hope they can understand to some degree. 

Don't think I have cried in the last 3 years but I was effectively sobbing as I wrote, thinking about how my family would react to hearing that I had killed myself. 

It did make me feel like I should try a little longer for them, but will see how the next few days go. As it's just going to get worse. I think I'll keep adding to the note as It was good writing that stuff down for me, like a small outlet of sorts. 

But yh don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I Just wanted to have another outlet I guess and I recommend writing a note of sorts if you are ever struggling as I found it helpful to think about my life, the effect it will have on others, and just thanking the people in my life",_DJay_,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfyjo7/wrote_a_suicide_note_last_night/

Random thoughts of getting fired from my job, losing my house, losing my family, have invaded my mind and won’t leave. I spend most of days crying, even while I’m at work. I can’t stop having negative thoughts. I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried medication. Nothing really seems to work. I’m at the point now where I’m wondering if I should just kill myself. Honestly I just don’t have any interest in living while I feel like this everyday. And I don’t see things changing, they only seem to get worse. I’ve quickly reached the end of my rope. I don’t want to tell my family this because they’ll do nothing but worry. I have no friends to talk to over the last couple years I’ve cut everyone of them off and I don’t know why.

My methods to cope with my depression have destroyed my life.,"I'm 29 years old, working fulltime and I live at home with my parents.

I have no confidence in myself or my abilities and I doubt myself in almost everything I do. For years I've had problems with relationships and have had bad experience with ""friends"" turning out not to be friends, so I shut myself off from others and hardly tell the truth to anyone, even my parents. After having so many friends and relationships explode in my face, I have a hard time connecting or opening up to people and admitting the truth about how I feel. Not even my parents really know how I felt until recently, and my coping methods to distract myself from my depression has almost destroyed my relationship with my parents where I don't think I can rely on them and honestly don't deserve their help.

I guess me pushing myself over the last few years hasn't helped. Because I can't do this anymore, I feel this emptiness and broken part of me inside growing more and more. I eat a lot because the taste of good food makes me happy, I spend money a lot to get that ""high"" of happiness feeling. I've gained weight, I don't exercise and use the excuse of my knees as a reason not to. I'm lonely and watch tv with my stuffed animal on the couch because its nice having it sit there and keep me company. It reminds me of when I was younger and happier. My outgoing and friendly personality has just been destroyed to the point where I don't want to be around large groups of people, I hate people, I feel irritated being in public. I feel angry, upset, scared, alone and afraid.

I don't know what to do and I feel like my depression has dug me into a hole that I will never escape and I will never fix the relationship with my parents due to my actions.

I need advice,"So I’m 13 and I am already done. I don’t want to die but I am also done with life. I’m closeted trans, I have sleeping issues, i get extremely anxious and I feel like everyone I am close to doesn’t care about me the same way I care about them. I am always last choice in my friend group, I’m always chosen to be the one who sits alone, and in group work instead of splitting into pairs my friends go 3-1. I get ecstatic when my “best friend” messages me but I don’t think they really care. I am always the first texter, I rarely get texted by anyone first. I am told I am loved but I never feel it. I am trying to seem ok when we do meet ups but I just can’t stay happy, I get asked if I’m ok and why I’m not talking much but when I try talk the conversations are short lived. I have been told I talk to much about my interests and that I can be “too much”. If one of my other friends were upset everyone wouldn’t stop until they found out what’s wrong and try help them, that doesn’t really happen to me. 
I make cards for my friends for random occasions, I am always the one to organise the party’s/events by making the groups and giving people jobs to help. I would do anything for my friends and I try my best to make them happy. I never start drama or talk bad about them.
I don’t understand why I feel like they are pulling away from me. It could be in my head but idk anymore. My favourite person has seemed to have lost interest in me and I don’t think I am their favourite back. I want a friend who is exited when I message them and wants to hang out with me. Everyone in my friend group has someone they are closest to and I don’t think I have that anymore. 
I’m not suic1da1 but I also wonder that if I did go; if anyone would care. I would trust my life with any of my friends and they can’t even say that they trust me. I have been told I’m too immature and I kinda just feel annoying for it. I know it not the best thing to do but I’m trying to change myself to make myself more likeable.

When does it get better?,"Its been a while since I got out of my toxic relationship, not long enough to move on, but long enough to realise I would never want to go back. I moved to a different country a few weeks before I fell out with my partner. I feel lonelier than ever. Its the kind of feeling where no thing or no one can make it go away except myself. Taking back my ex would give me temporary relief, but I know nothing will change. Dare I say it might even go worse. 
I developed an eating disorder during my relationship too. I don’t know if the relationship itself triggered it, or if it was solely me, but that definitely does not help either. I have no friends or people to talk to in my new place, and I won’t be able to go out and socialise with new people until a few more months. I feel suicidal at times, but I’m able to knock myself out of it. My friends have been absolute sweethearts to me, supporting me whenever I need help, and always reassuring me on my decision to leave my ex, but I don’t want to burden them any longer.
That relationship completely ruined me. By moving countries, I also had to leave behind someone very very close to me, and I will only get to see her after a few months. The future scares me to the point it makes me want to go back to my home country and leave all my dreams and goals behind. I feel helpless and clueless.

Can't manage to do anything but go to work. And sometimes that is hard in itself.,"A long-term off and on again relationship with a narcissist has ruined me. Before him, I was an avid gym goer. I had confidence. My house was spotless and I generally was thriving. Had a positive outlook on life and now, it is like I am a zombie just going to work, coming home and drinking. Watching anything that will take my mind off of the situation that I am in. I used to cry constantly. Now I am just numb. My house looks similar to a hoarder's. I haven't done laundry in forever. I don't work out anymore. I stopped being good to myself and I don't know how to stop this funk I have fallen into. It is almost like I have a form of agoraphobia. I have a few friends that have asked me to social functions or even out to eat. I can't make myself go. Now my daughter is angry with me about all of it attacking me as a human being because I can't shake these blues. How do I come out of this?

Doesn't Feel Worth It,"I don't know when, probably sometime in the past year or two, I've just started wondering all the time why I'm putting in even the minimal effort to be alive. I've stopped thinking that it's worth it or that it even might be worth it someday. Why do we all have to slog along like this just for maybe a moment of peace or rest. Forget about happiness. I only ever get it in shards that are always too small.

We stand up and go to work and if this kind of life is ever questioned, it's just a hiccup and everything carries on and on and on in the grey, unforeseeable future. Why do we have to struggle to have a place to rest. When did life become work and not just living. 

If this is living, I can't say I have much interest in being alive. Or at the very least, I'm not interested in living this kind of life. It's not worth it, to me. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm 24 fucking years old, and I'm exhausted, and I've seen enough, and I've had enough. Nothing brings me joy. I'm apathetic about pretty much everything.

Every day is worst,"Every day more suicidal

So, it's been a while since my depressed state has been growing but these days is turning hell. 

Due to summer, I am in home until september I begin again college so I spend most of the day alone only with my thoughts, so  memories came into my mind and make me feel sick, angry and extremely sad and depressed. 

The main reasons for my depressed state is that some months ago I lost the only girl I truly loved and can't forget. Also I am trying to build income or pass the college career but I failed in some areas and my parents are not very happy with this. 

My only hobby is go to gym and lifting some weights and maybe meet sometimes with a couple friends and playing some pool at afternoons or party at night. Drinking a lot of alcohol too, only thing that make me happy for a moment. 

What I am feeling is that every day I feel more sorrow and more depressed, I feel sick of the head and suicidal thoughts appear more frequently, I feel that I am a failure and living like this doesnt make sense.",Nov927,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg9rza/every_day_is_worst/

Impossible Tasks - Accomplished,"So I usually don’t post my personal things. 

But I’ve been struggling. 

I was laid off in April. I’ve been on unemployment since then. 

I’ve had plenty of interviews and some of those have felt really promising, only to be rejected. I think it’s been about 1-2 a week. It’s hard. 

Meanwhile, my car was repo’d. (Working on getting it back). 

Electric and gas were almost shut off. 

Haven’t heard back from the State of MN for emergency assistance. 

I’ve been putting off calling all those places. No idea why. Just because I literally can’t. But then I sit up all night and just expect the worst. Disconnection. No help. Etc. 

I made myself take a hard look at my 8month old daughter last night. I made myself promise that for her, my other kids, and my wife, I’d call all 3 places AND my landlord today. 

It took me about 2 hours to do it all. 5-10 minute phone calls each. 

But I did it. And I got most of it sorted. So that’s one less worry for me. 

Man was it hard tho. I can’t explain why I was avoiding it. I know I can’t. I can’t explain why it’s so hard sometimes to just look at my texts or respond. 

But I did it. And today, today I feel a little bit better.",IshMorningstar,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg8xwe/impossible_tasks_accomplished/

My first year at uni has ruined me,"I’m not really quite sure where to start. I’m 21, female and from England. I moved to a different city 4 hours away from my hometown to study last September.
I’m quite outgoing, confident and self assured and would say that I was already quite mature and content before I left uni. I was happy within myself and was so hopeful and optimistic that my university experience would be full of opportunity and newness. 
I’m very close to my single mother and moving away was extremely hard. It was great in the beginning when I was navigating through my new city, filled with new people and it was, to me, a honeymoon stage because it didn’t last for too long. I was eating well everyday, looking after myself physically - but now the years over, I am mentally burnt out. 

I didn’t have the greatest time with friends even though I’m incredibly social. I didn’t realise the majority of people just wanted to drink and do drugs and go clubbing most of the time. I didn’t find ‘my’ people, and instead found people that loved to put me down despite how unproblematic I am. I lived with 7 other girls in uni halls and it was the worst. What helped me was my incredible lecturers, the support I had from them helped me so much. 

I spent my whole year, everyday picking myself up if I felt sad or anxious. My FOMO didn’t help either, I’ve been waiting to go to university for a very long time and the build up of expectations also led to my demise. My mum would come and stay with me for a week at a time every other month when she realised I wasn’t okay. 
Somehow I managed to pass all of my exams and my year, which I didn’t think I could do with how low I felt and how constantly ill I was getting, probs due to stress. 
My whole year I was surrounded by toxic, and negative people - who mostly dropped out towards the end anyway because they were so unserious. My coursemates are all toxic and treat the degree like it’s a competition.
I’ve come back home for summer feeling broken, feeling like I’m not who I was anymore. I feel numb, and I feel empty - I feel like nothing excites me anymore and I feel burnt out. I think my stress levels were so high this past year that my body physically can’t handle it because for the first time in my life, my face has broken out in painful eczema that won’t go away. Which doesn’t help how I’m feeling because now im back home, I just want to go out and about and distract myself from my year. 
I want to share a lot but I don’t want this post to be too long - but I do feel like, my year moving out to uni traumatised me. 
I had covid for a month in January and had never felt so alone and by myself. Trying to manage food and looking after myself was so difficult that I ended up becoming so ill, paramedics had to take me to the hospital. I had no one around me that truly cared, and it was the most isolating experience I’ve ever had. There’s a feeling I can’t shake from spending my year alone trying to navigate my world, and then the feeling of living on campus which made me feel suffocated. The food shops every week, the workload of my course, the urge to experience life in this new city and do everything I could to do it etc etc.  I think my year would’ve been the complete opposite if I didn’t live in halls, or if I had a good, consistent group of people around me. I don’t drink or smoke, and I’m not the type of person whose interested in short term relationships or flings, at heart I do feel a lot older and just crave peace. I know next year all I want to do is study, go gym and eat and sleep well and have a part time job. I really want to use these few years at uni to build a life for myself, I just don’t know where I went wrong, because whose to blame other than me.

Despite that, on the upside - I have a nice house next year which isn’t uni accommodation with two lovely girls, one who I’ve known all year. So I can’t complain about that, and my new neighbourhood is incredible. It won’t have that suffocating, uni student feel. It’s nice to be around families and kids, or older people.  I just want to heal from my past experience so I can enjoy my new chapter and hopefully a better year. 

I guess I just want some advice to heal and cope now, and to help my body mentally and physically heal. I went into uni happy, and bubbly, no self esteem issues and incredible confidence and good health. But this whole time, it’s been slowly chipping away and I’m not kind to myself one bit. I don’t feel like me, and I don’t know how to go about feeling like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Even though I passed my year and I’m proud of myself, I don’t even feel any sort of way about it. I know all of how I’m feeling is perspective and mindset, I just don’t know what I need. I do have the desire to change and work on myself to get better, if anyone has anything I could learn from to help me, I really will listen - I’m desperate. 

I have big goals after uni. To become an optometrist, and buy a home for me and my mum. I spent a few years working super hard to have saved a small deposit on a place for us both. I have a lot going for me and I’m grateful for all of my opportunities, but most of the time I just feel like I’m wasted potential but don’t know how to go about it. I constantly beat myself up and pick on myself. I sometimes wonder how I will ever be good enough for the world around me.

people telling me I'm addicted to antidepressants,"I've been on antidepressants for 9 or so years now and after this recent study on depression I have dozens of people telling me I should quit. I tried to do that years ago and when I tell people that the last time I tried my depression worsened, they tell me it's because I'm addicted.

This does confuse me a bit because I've been addicted to pot in the past and the withdrawals from that are nothing like what happened when I stopped taking antidepressants. The medication also doesn't cause a state of 'euphoria' like easily addictive drugs do. It's rather upsetting to see so many people use this study to say that depression isn't real and ""you just need to eat better and exercise more."" These people probably haven't ever seen what depression looks like and are just following what these 'alpha males' are saying.

Depression runs in the family on my mom's side and she's still medicated (she's also in the medical field), so I think mine is genetic rather than being cause by a tragedy.

"Life's a Gamble (Unnecessary Life, a Rant)","32, no job, never cared for a career, and frankly irritated that I was ever brought into existence.

I was just looking up suicide by hanging.

I fantasize of putting an end to it all more often than not. But I always overthink the pain, and worry whether I would fail and wind up with more day-to-day pain. 

I hate working, I have no desire to fit into society (I feel the pressures of it though), I see no point in life and struggle to create one for myself.

Anti-social, social anxiety, anhedonic depression, avoidant personality, misanthropic views... These are the main things that seem to make me me. 

I view people as the bane of my existence. 

Most of my problems are traced back to artificial creation (capitalism/the system, the double edged sword of technology etc.), and the simple fact that humans have the capacity to think about the unnecessary pointlessness of life and the inherent struggles and mortality that comes with it... And yet still choose to procreate. 

No imaginary unborn human is screaming from the void rhat they want this... It's the selfish and perhaps myopic decision of already born people.

Generic and succinct post summing up a few of the problems. 

There is no point to life, but that is not what makes me wish I could end it -- it's life itself; as soon as you are born you are instantly a thing that requires vital needs (and you need to find ways to obtain those survival needs), a thing that will experience pain and suffering guaranteed (and no promise of pleasure worth living for); and you may or may not be okay with it.

I'm not okay with it.

Feel like I don’t deserve anything,"My car was 10 years old with 200k miles on it and was a Ford Edge. I had wanted it to last me til kids graduate college in 1.5 years bc I just worry “what if” all the time and never buy myself anything.  My car was randomly stalling  in the middle of the road while driving and Ford couldn’t find the issue bc the car would stay on but I had to restart it and it cleared the code. It was also shifting rough, etc. So, I figured it’s time for a diff car.  It’s a bad time to buy, I know , I just didn’t feel safe pulling out etc. So I got an almost new Subaru Crosstrek, a modest car that will again last me a long time . My husband was like get u a car, u never buy shit. It’s not the money, Its in my Budget and no bills except I subsidize my kids college rent 700 a month combined (350 each with roommates). I got their tuition paid from working compulsively for 3 years. I got an extra job while they were in community college which was free in my state so they can have no debt for the last 2 years. That’s my lifetime gift to them and they are appreciative and work hard and pay the rest of their b bills. 

So my point is, I feel like a don’t deserve a nicer car and I’ve never bought one this new . I just feel like omg what if something bad happens and now I have a car payment (I plan to pay off early). I still have savings too. It’s just an irrational thing that thinks I don’t deserve it or call myself selfish in my head for getting myself something. I know a car isn’t a good purchase but I did need one but got one nicer than I needed.

I have Bipolar type I disorder and the depressive episodes, which last over a year, are un-endurable. I am incapable of killing myself, because first of all, I am too scared, and second, it would only cause more complications (more negative karma, family grief, etc.) from all that I have read. Every few years the symptoms improve and then I sometimes go into a manic state, but eventually I fall right back to the deep, black depressions every time. I have done a ridiculous amount of work on myself but I always end up right back where I started. It's insane.

I have tried every conceivable remedy over the years and nothing has worked. Medications don't work, therapy doesn't work, and even psychedelics don't work. I have sought out every type of healing method around the world, and nothing has helped. I am not kidding when I say that I have tried it all. I have scoured the internet over the years searching every possible thing I could do and nothing has changed. All it has done is reinforced the idea that there is something horribly wrong with me, or my soul. Year after year, the pain continues. I keep sinking lower and lower into hell. Lots of people around me get better, but I don't, and I don't know why.

One of the worst aspects of this is that I am unable to connect to other people. I am so far disconnected from others that social interactions are painful and almost unbearable. My reality and state of consciousness is always flooded with this psychic and emotional pain that I am unable to experience love. There is no thought, memory or imagination that can change this state. It's pure pain, all the time, every day.

Statistically speaking, it is unlikely to ever get better for me, unless there will be some miraculous treatment that comes out of science which is highly unlikely, given that society is in a state of collapse and mental health is the last priority in this capitalistic world.

My every-day reality is one of extreme, 10 out of 10 suffering on a daily basis. I have exhausted every heroic attempt to get better and I am at the point where all I have is patient endurance. That's it. There's nothing more than endurance at this point. So then, what is the point of life? This game is certainly not worth the candle, but I am not allowed to quit, so what other conclusion can I draw but that it is a punishment?

So I endure this thing, day after day, as the world goes by.

I have ready many NDE reports, and all I can hope is that this thing ends soon for me. From the perspective of me to my soul, all I can say is that this learning experiment is highly unethical. It has caused a level of suffering for me that I could not ever imagine was possible on a human level. I hope and pray to god that it ends soon.

I have learned a tremendous amount on the spiritual level, mostly from reading. From the Buddhist perspective there is of course equanimity, but when all you have is nothing but extreme levels of pain and suffering, the idea of equanimity becomes a joke.

For me, and I am sure for many others, this place is a living hell. I have done my absolute best to get better and nothing has worked. What other conclusions can I draw from my life?

When my time eventually comes, I can only wonder whether (in the spirit world) I will laugh or I will cry. I understand that it is a learning experience to know contrast and bla blah blah, but from the perspective of this lifetime, it is a torture chamber, and nothing more.

I know that I am not the only one. I am sorry that we are at a point in this human experience where we only have very limited remedies for this kind of thing. I hope and pray for you that your next lifetime, wherever it may be, contains less suffering. I hope to never come back to this place. The highs are certainly not worth the lows. Not even close.

My plan is to endure this thing, breath by breath, until I die of natural causes. I cannot overemphasize how much this reality hurts. This is a living nightmare. Why, just why?",neirh93ur9ej,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wg6viv/my_life_is_a_living_hell/
Am I wrong?,"Ive have a mild depression and rn struggling from quite bad anxiety. My mother says that depression is a luxury because the poor just push the depression on the side to work for food. She laughs at me when I try to vent and tells me to deal with it or go suicide (as a joke “oh it’s funny, you’re sensitive”). Other “jokes” such as: “wow you look depressed” “haha my child’s depressed” “you’re depressed again? Go die” “you’re so hard to deal with, I’m tired and this is what you do to me” “you should be glad that…” etc etc. 

She tells me to just push it away and distract myself, that everything is psychological (ofc that’s the truth, but she’s telling me as if I can snap out of it) and essentially I’m focusing on myself too much whilst others just “deal with it” and don’t baby about it. She taught me how to hide my feelings, called me a spoiled brat, etc. I think I am spoiled though (we are ~ middle class) and I do think I get love in some way from her, but I feel guilty for feeling this way and I feel like a whiner. She told me I could always talk to her whenever I need to, and she’ll help me but now she’s literally taking my shit as stand up comedy. She has different personalities, sometimes it’s irritated and mocking, sometimes it’s caring and considerate and I get so confused as to which one I’m venting to. It’s a game of chance. Sometimes I feel alone, sometimes I don’t, sometimes I feel supported, sometimes I don’t. I’m in a mental mess rn and all she says is to deal with it, I’m so lucky that I can focus on myself like that, it’s luxury, I’m selfish, selfish fuckhead, etc. I feel so… wrong. How do I “deal with it”??? I’m very lost. My mental illness screwed up the perception of myself and others and my mother’s words just fucked me up, I lost my personality and self esteem. Am I whiny? Am I wrong? Am I selfish? Is depression a luxury? Is anxiety just a snap out of it thing?

I don’t feel anything from anything.,"I don’t know when it started but I’ve been struggling to feel any sort of emotion for a while now with the exception of a few breakdowns. No matter how hard I try to have fun or be happy always ends up in disaster. No games I play anymore give me any kind of enjoyment. My favourite tv show I used to literally cry over on some occasions are just pixels on a screen to me now.I went on a holiday to the Maldives, Singapore and New Zealand this year. I didn’t feel a sliver of any sort of emotion. I feel empty and I don’t know what to do. I exercise, I have a great group of friends, I don’t do drugs, alcohol, my family is as perfect as can be and I have a beautiful girlfriend that I will hopefully marry some day.

I'm just so sick of being here.

In the end me not doing anything just contributes to me being miserable but I just can't help it. Everything seems pointless and stupid.

I'm so tired of this,"Every day is so uncomfortable. I always feel like I'm forgetting something. Everything always feels so off and I can't do anything about it. Just sitting in my room is uncomfortable because the dresser is messy, the fan is loud, the sheet isn't straightened, and nothing fixes it. Everything I do just feels off and tiring. Nothing makes me happy. Whenever I try to play video games or draw, I'm just reminded that I have no skills and I'm bad at everything. I don't even bother playing my saxophone because I haven't gotten any better after years of playing, and doing it is so draining. I don't even have the attention span to read or watch movies. Everything I do feels like a chore, even if it's supposed to be the opposite. Even sleeping is hard because my brain gets so bored of just sitting there, but I'm too tired to do anything else. I hate feeling so uncomfortable and weird, even when I'm just doing nothing. It feels like everything is just like a layer of skin I want to peel off. I just want to be able to sit down and play Animal Crossing without feeling like a failure. I want to be able to play minecraft without crumpling up my paper full of ideas, and crying because nothing makes me happy. The only times I feel good are when i get random feelings of euphoria and creativity for like 20 seconds. Nothing triggers it. Nothing strengthens it. It just randomly happens like once or twice a day, and that's all I have to look forward to. I hate just loosing whatever thought I have because of my stupid ADHD. I hate that I'm always paranoid that I'm forgetting something. I hate that I can't remember the simplest things. I hate making lists to try to help myself, because they never make it better. I hate that the only reason I play webkinz and Animal Crossing is because they are like a chore. They don't even make me happy, but I feel the need to do all of the stupid daily things.

Corporate excuse for taking a break due to depression ?,"I have been on/off depression for the past decade. Been on multiple antidepressants, seen multiple psychologists and psychiatrist. 

Had an awful corporate job in the financial sector, with crazy hours (9AM to 10pm) and quit as I got fed up and reached a point where I couldn't juggle depression + heavy workload.

After this, I spent the past 12 months just taking care of myself, moved out, got a new apartment, furnishing and settling in. Done a bit of travelling but haven't really done much tbh. Been doing diligently therapy, seeing a psychologist every week - which has only made things worse from having to remember all those bottled up feelings - leaving me fucked up for 24h after each session.  


**-&gt;** Now I wanna start looking for a job, but I'm looking for **ideas as to how to justify taking a 1 year break** without bringing up the mental health issues ?

Quick backstory: adusive narcissistic parents, never allowed to be sad, strict rules, isolated, depressed since around 13, didn't feel safe talking to anyone, made to always feel like the worst and a failure, thought it was all normal. I attempted to take my life at 14. Later went to uni, found out my life was far from normal. Finally tried to get help and moved out. I am 23 with a stable job and recently cut ties with my parents.

Back to current time: although I'm getting help, I have a support system, I am dating an awesome girl, I still can't stop my brain from making me feel like shit. Like I don't deserve anything. Like my feelings aren't valid. Everyone hates me. I am starting to spiral now again and have started cutting again. I have ""casual"" suicidal thoughts in the back of my head. I have started seeking ways to get out of this reality, even for just a moment (aka alcohol and drugs). And I'm scared of where this is going. I know these thoughts aren't logical but they get to me anyway.

I am honest, to an extent, about that I'm not doing good for my coworkers, friends and HR at work. But I don't think they get how serious things have become. And I can't imagine how they would even help in the first place even if they knew. I guess I feel so isolated. I feel that even if I tell people, even if I get help by professionals that I'll always just be stuck in this isolated bubble. Stuck with myself. If my doctor can't help me I don't think anyone can?",Murky_Necessary1815,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfu69e/i_feel_isolated_and_alone_although_friends_and/

"Does depression symptoms ever just feel like ""I'm never in the mood""?","I just had a strange revelation. I realized that sometimes my depression mood isnt necessarily always feeling depressed like sad or lonely, but like this intense heavy veil of ""never feeling in the mood"". 

I wanna write something I know I will enjoy and love, but I don't feel in the mood... I'm not getting the feel good feelings. I feel dread at the idea of starting and it feels pointless. 

I'm watching my fav youtube channels. They're entertaining and funny but I rarely ever laugh or crack a smile anymore, if ever. I just never seem to be in the mood. And it's hard to focus. 

I wanna play a video game I know I love. I play for a little while but feel nothing. Can't get immersed. Don't feel in the mood. Can't feel invested to get far. 

And it sucks because I wanna laugh, and I wanna get into a fun creative mode and everything but I feel like I'm in this blank, numb state. I either feel sad and lonely, ruminating on things that hurt me or hurt me now, or I feel just so dull and uninterested. So much so I never feel like I'm truly enjoying anything that isn't a fast hit of pleasure, like a cookie. 

It just often feels like this dull void and never feeling in the mood enough for anything and not enjoying much of anything. A lot of anhedonia. A lot of longing for something to fill the void again.",snickerssnacks,40,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wezufb/does_depression_symptoms_ever_just_feel_like_im/

Finally realising how I see myself.,"Apologies in advance for the dramatic language, it’s a but embarrassing but oh well. 

I realise that ever since I was young, probably about 11, every year that passes has been a notch in the belt of my self hatred. 

I have watched the approach of New Years, birthdays, Halloween’s, each time promising myself that I will be a better person on this milestone day. A person worth being here. Someone better than the person making that promise. Each event comes and goes, and I have had to sit back and accept that I am still myself, and that seemingly I will never care about myself enough to change. I will never lose the weight. Dye my hair. Get a job. Get prettier, funnier, be more successful in a way that I can bring up to myself in bulletpoints, to then show to friends or family members who ask how I’m doing. 

But I did make those changes. I did lose weight. Changed my hair. Got a job. Did all the things I wanted to do. And almost as soon as I had them I threw them away. I don’t love myself enough to bother trying. Even if I prove I can succeed, underneath my success is a person that I for some reason truly do despise. I have never hated another person the way I hate myself. What feels like hatred for others is shown in actions, or more often thoughts, of a passionate nature. Imagining hitting, screaming, fighting that person. The hate I have for myself is deeper because it’s not this superficial, firey hate that inspires actions. It doesn’t go away after time. It’s a cold and neglectful hate. I watch myself isolate, run out of medication, eat like shit and sleep like I have nothing worth waking up for. I do nothing about this. Or almost nothing. Because at the very least I do question myself. I stop and think, wonder why I treat myself this way. I’ve done this or some variation of this for the past 13 years. If I had been raising a child this way the product would at best be a self hating shell of a teenager who has no obligation to live other than not wanting to seem ungrateful. But more likely, that child would have died of starvation and neglect over a decade ago.

I am shocked. I have known I didn’t like myself, but to finally allow myself to truly see, I am just in a state of plain shock. That this is the person I’ve become. Not looking at my accomplishments or lack thereof. Simply my relationship with myself, and just how truly heartless my behaviour towards myself has been. I do feel very remorseful towards my past self. And also ashamed of the self pity. But I just don’t know where to go from here.",hotgrilledcharlie,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfx8je/finally_realising_how_i_see_myself/
Just out of curiosity?,"Does anyone else here share any of these symptoms?

1. Feeling out of place even when you know you've been accepted by your peers.

2. Feeling out of place even when in doing an activity you used to love.

3. After 8 months of dealing with anxiety and deppression you still feel out of place around family members even though all they want to do is help.

4. Unable to exercise becuase the voice in your head tells you ""What's the point it's not gonna do anything?""

5. Absolutely 0 self confidence even in your own job that you've been doing for 5+ years.

6. Overly nice to everyone for no reason, all because you can't think of how to stand up for yourself ever. Ps -I'm not even great at being nice just overly apologetic and polite.

7. Sometimes you get caught in this empty loop in your head where you're just freaking out. It's like your head won't tell you what you want or desire. You just get all hot and sweaty and uncomfortable as can be and there's almost nothing you can do to stop it.

8. You feel as though you lack the abillity to raise children even though you've done it for 7+ years. 

9. When you do fun things there's no inner dialogue to yourself it's just a feeling of joy and the only thing you can think about is how thankful you are that you get a short break from your everyday negative thoughts and feelings.",Jlove0414,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfjtap/just_out_of_curiosity/

Currently feeling like a useless lab rat who can't be happy for themselves even if they try.,"You know those slightly smarmy advice articles you read when you're down, that tell you to change your mindset, pursue a hobby that makes you happy, and simply get out of your comfort zone? Yeah. I wish changing being depressed was easy as they make it sound. 

Prozac is the fourth drug I've taken to curb my depression and at least try and function like a normal twenty-one year old, but it's showed no signs of improving. I still feel worthless, incompetent, like I'm pissing the best years of my life down the drain. 

I'm in therapy. I'm physically active. I'm social. I get decent grades in college, I'm set to graduate next year. I'm doing everything I can, all the right things to better myself and here I am: still feeling like I'm worthless, like I'm a mentally stunted 13 yr old living in an adult's body. Everything takes so much effort. Why can't I just use my willpower and simply get better? People tell me to believe in ""personal power"", that it's ""all in my head"", and that I'm ""loved and people like being around me."" I don't feel any of it. 

What do I do with myself, besides eat sleep and scroll on my phone? I keep thinking about dying, out of hopelessness. Life looks so easy for everyone else. People don't understand when I try to tell them how I feel. My family just thinks I'm lazy, that I'm weak, that I'm a quitter. I've lost friendships because of me being mentally ill.

When will I begin to love myself?,"All my life has been hate &amp; disparities. From growing up with with abusive parents, low self esteem, and a mind telling me life will always be a terror in its own. I’ve always had demons I fight every single day. New demons &amp; many many old. I want so badly to begin loving myself. Using these demons &amp; problems life has given me &amp; create my own personal super power. I know so well how to love others, but never to love myself. Until that day comes I’ll always be a sad soul wishing for my time to end. I look up at the stars &amp; think to myself how my world would be without my troubles I’ve been given, what life would be like if I wasn’t me. But I don’t want another life, I just want to feel like I love myself. 

My tired soul can’t stand to bare another day unfortunately… I tell myself daily today is the day. I truly believe that one who is willing to take their life is a soul forgotten. I’ve never attempted because I know that attempt will not be an attempt, but a promise to myself. This is again one my attempts at asking this world to please allow me to find a path soon, as time is not going to last much longer. 

To everyone &amp; everything I’ve hurt along my journey, I’m sorry. I’m sorry mother for this world punishing you so hard &amp; forcing you into a world in which I exist. I’m sorry friends &amp; family I’ve let down with my lies &amp; sadness I’ve brought you. I’ve never meant to hurt anyone, my struggles have only brought my soul anger &amp; sadness.

"Some call it depression,","I call it enlightenment. Once the kids are raised, which is driven by love and instinct, it really is all kinda pointless. It is somewhat prior to that bc why have kids? Instinct and of course then you love them like crazy. 

But it’s all just a slog to work and back home to pay for a roof over ur head, food, and power. It’s all pointless really then u repeat it all over and over and hope u have some happy moments which are distractions. At best u can have an obsession or hobby. Then around 50 ur best years are gone. I swear who the fuck wants to live to 95 with aches, pains, added debilitations added on. A healthy 95 year old still hurts to move, gets around slow, looks old, you can’t have sex, and lives with a terminal illness bc they are 95.

She's even made comments in the past about me not even needing to get a glass of water on my own(we have househelp for everything), while she has to do household chores and help around the house. She always doubted my experiences when I told her I felt like my parents didn't love me. She thought I was in the wrong for yelling at my mother bc I'm obviously wrong for feeling bitter about never having a proper mother/daughter bond with her. She always thought he experiences were far worse than mine. And I agree that I have it better, but that doesn't mean my troubles are not valid. 

I just realised today though, how much harm her comment caused me overtime. I became very withdrawn and literally stopped talking to everyone because I just didn't want to spread negativity and didn't know how to talk without bringing up all the problems in my life. I went off of all social media. People who don't see me on the daily, I might as well not exist for them. Aditionally, I doubt all my experiences and my emotional rsponses to them, and constantly wonder if I'm just being dramatic and want attention, or am I genuinely upset/distressed. I just don't want to burden anyone. I am at a stage where I can't express myself properly and also don't want therapy because I think maybe I don't need help, and a therapist's time is better spent helping someone who needs it more than I do. 


But I will never get better. I just know it. Perhaps, it is what I deserve for being an entitled/priveleged piece of shit my whole life.",sweetoon01,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfswt6/an_exfriend_once_told_me/
Why do I even exist?,"The depression comes temporary to me but when it comes, it feels like it is the worst life or worst time, I don't wanna live this anymore. I don't know why but I care about the reputation or respect so much. When someone disrespectfully behaves to me, it brings me intense depression. Even the music doesn't work but makes it worse. I have goals, but not devoting myself to it or not willing to. It feels like I am here to be responsible for others only not for me. If I scold myself, nothing changes but if someone else does the same, the intense depression is on the way. I just want to forget this moment and move on but it's not possible.

Fuck it,"Ive been severely depressed for more than a decade now. I’ve tried dozens of therapists and medications with zero improvement. Every day I battle suicidal thoughts and frankly there’s a dwindling number of reasons not to do it. So basically I’ve decided fuck it. I’m gonna work until the end of this quarter. Planning to cash out my 401k/IRA and take my life savings and do whatever the fuck I want. Probably will be able to travel and live pretty well for at least a year. When the money runs out so does my time. Figure I should at least try and enjoy what I’ve earned before I check out.

Still figuring out how to discuss with the few remaining friends and family in my life. Will probably just tell them I’m going away and don’t know when I’ll be back. 

Even from a young age I always knew I’d never make it out of my 20s. Like people would always ask me what I wanted to do or where I saw my life headed and I never had an answer.

Advice on breaking up with someone,"I know the title seems bad but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for my situation. I’m in a relationship with someone and we both deal with depression and anxiety. Recently we both have been at a bad point in our depression and one of the causes my depression has gotten worse is because of this relationship. It was something I noticed a couple weeks ago but I’m constantly more emotionally drained and I started talking to my friends less again. We’ve been together for quite a few months and we were very close in the beginning but when this started getting bad for the both of us, it wasn’t the same anymore. I did like them, I really did but I feel as though the spark I felt in the beginning has dimmed and I’m no longer 100% there. The relationship also isn’t the most healthy for either of us and I started to think that maybe we shouldn’t have gotten together. Recently thoughts of taking a break or breaking up have crossed my mind but then I was afraid of the outcome. I’m pretty sure I’m almost like a lifeline to this person, I’m one of the only people who make them happy and help them but I’ve become so drained and I’m afraid that if I break things off, he may try to unalive himself or hurt himself but I also don’t think it’s fair for either of us when I’m not 100% in it. If anyone could give some advice or insight it would be much appreciated.",ParticularOk9219,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfxjlv/advice_on_breaking_up_with_someone/
When you feel depressed but don’t know what to call it..?,"I’m fairly certain I have no hope for the future. Medication is currently not helping it seems, despite my increased dosage from 2020/21.
I cancelled my therapy because it’s also too expensive and did not seem to help. Using an online therapist due to the pandemic was a useful strategy that did not pan out well and ultimately cost almost 1k that I wish I had back.

I’ve taken to sleeping starting about 7-9 am in an effort to avoid the rest of humanity during ‘peak’ times. I usually do not wake until 5-7 pm on the average day.
I do my grocery shopping at night with headphones in to avoid others. I have zero adult friends who I speak with regularly via phone or in person, only a handful of folks who I chat with via text and/or Discord etc.
I havnt been ‘invited’ to an activity by another adult since a friends daughters party in February.

I play the same two-three video games most days, then sleep when I get bored and or worn out on the repetitive nature.
I’ve expressed interest in new games only to find myself completely bored/indifferent to them, with no way to ‘get excited’ about what once was an enjoyable activity.

I have honestly no hope this will change, and no motivation to make positive changes. I’ve heard good things about Yoga, meditation, and attempting a more ‘zen’ lifestyle, nothing like this works for me because I can’t settle my mind long enough to do anything meaningful — I ultimately just fall asleep, or give up as it’s a wasted effort.

I eat one meal a day or less with random snacks, I drink water and a few caffeinated sodas, but no alcohol. I gave it up at the start of the year when I lost a promising job in Dec. 2021.

What is wrong with me?,"I can’t help but push everyone who’s important to me far, far away.

I don’t want to answer texts right away (or at all). I’ve ghosted some people because I just can’t keep up and find the energy to stay engaged in conversations. I feel like I don’t know how to talk to people, and that makes me feel alienated even more. I see my friends and neighbors hang out without me, and it makes me feel sad. 

To make things worse, I got laid off last week. I’m trying to hold it together, but it feels like my world is crumbling. My dog also had a seizure yesterday, and now she isn’t eating. I don’t know how to talk to people about these things without sounding emotional. I’m stressed. I haven’t wanted to talk about it because I’m afraid of falling apart in front of others. But now I’m afraid that my silence is being projected as coldness and meanness.

For example, my roommate is on the other side of it all — she just got promoted and received a hefty raise. All she talks about is her new pilates studio and how she gets Fridays off now. I can’t help but feel jealous of her and her happiness, and I can feel myself giving her the cold shoulder because I don’t want to hear about how great things are for her. I don’t want to be around it for some reason. I didn’t talk to her at all last week, not even a “hey.” She went on a walk with our friends this afternoon. I saw them all together and they awkwardly said hi to me. I greeted her tonight when she walked in the kitchen, but she just smiled and turned back to her room. 

How do I stop overthinking all this? I truly hate feeling this way. I feel so self-conscious and negative, and it’s not how I want to live my life. I feel like I am focusing so much on the negative that I’m losing sight of the bigger picture.

Depression can't love,"Last year, I pulled a rope off my husband's neck as he was trying to hurt himself.

After that I lost myself in depression, blaming myself for ruining our lives.

I have taken away a lot of his happiness because of the way I am.

I call him terrible names and get so angry. 

Verbally and emotionally abusive towards him.

I can't leave the house and we have no friends.

Back and forth we go dancing with my extreme emotions.

Which wife will it be today - happy sad or bitchy.

That night we got into a big fight and I called him terrible things.

I used to run away a lot when it became too much.

I used to hide out in the park bathroom to cry.

When I came home he was turning red and couldn't breathe.

He said he was tired of being my punching bag.

That still haunts me.

To be the victim, you victimize others too.

To be hurt, means you hurt others too.

I was depressed at that time, but I didn't see he was depressed too.

The only difference is now, I am depressed again.

He moved us a state away this summer - to pursue his new, healthier job.

I had to quit my career and have been unemployed for 2+ months.

In this isolation, the depression has come back around and I can't seem to do anything now.

I keep thinking back to the trauma we've experienced together.

To the way I am and the ways I have hurt him.

I keep thinking about how his life would be easier without me in it.

He's happier, he's working hard, and he's in a better environment now.

Things are looking up for him, and so I can be at peace knowing he's okay.

Yet, he tells me he's sad to leave me when he goes to work and comes home seeing me in the same spot. He tells me he's sad to see me so broken.

I don't want to ruin his life anymore.

I don't want to be the source of his pain.

It doesn't get easier over time.

Depression always comes back around.

This time, I don't know how to stop it.

I don't know how to stop life except through death.

Don't worry I don't plan to end it, it just is how it is.

But maybe leaving him will save us from repeating the same mistakes.

ig this is my only visible of help,"i’m so fucking tired of living. i thought i was depressed before but this is actual, severe depression. nothing seems enjoyable i’m just fighting to find some kind of stimulation for my brain to escape this hell. i’ve sheltered myself from the outside world completely, i just sit and rot inside my room. the only excitement or joy i find whenever i wake up and respond to my gf’s text and the rest of the day is hell.

i live inside my head constantly from the moment i wake up to when i close my eyes to sleep. i’ve grown an extreme amount of hatred for myself unlike anyone else on this planet because of it. from overthinking every situation i put in my head to anything i can think of. i’ve been tossed around and treated like shit by a lot of people in my 18 years of living. i have no love for myself whatsoever. i have little to no trust in anyone, also because of how i’ve been treated. so in my constant state overthinking it always turns to self hatred. that being because of guilt or just being tired of living in my head. for example, i feel guilty for overthinking everything my gf does and thinking almost anything she does is a way to backstab me even tho i’m almost positive she isn’t trying to hurt me or do me dirty. only because i’ve been so scarred by other people. i just can’t stand who i am i’m filled with rage and uncomfortableness being in my own skin. i’ve never been more comforted by the thought of blowing my brains out till now, even when i tried to overdose twice. but lucky me i can’t kill myself, i couldn’t do that to my family, close friends, and gf. my gf has a grieving disorder which could really fuck her up, and it would also devastate my closest friends for eternity. it gives me a large amount of pain not being able to end my own life

another thing, i suffer really horribly with dpdr (depersonalization/dissociation disorder). nothing feels real and i constantly live life as a spectator and it’s only made me more depressed. i can barley even think and output a sentence with people because of how bad it is. when existence isn’t comfortable at all with all these intrusive thoughts i have and existential dread/thinking. i have really bad ocd and it’s part of the reason why i’m still dealing with chronic dpdr

also, i also have sleep insomnia. so i can’t even sleep to avoid depression i just there and be in my head like always but it’s even worse whenever i’m trying to sleep. and i’m aware that healthy amounts of sleep can help a lot with mental health but again, i’m blessed with another problem with me.

Doing something even a little bit wrong shuts me down…looking if anyone else experiences this.,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this, or if this is even a depression thing, but it’s the only formal dx I’ve ever had in my past. So wondering if this is a symptom or if anyone experiences the same thing.   

Any time I make a mistake that other people notice it seems to affect me so strongly it ruins my life for a long time after. Other people don’t seem to experience this (even other depressed people I know, which is why I hesitate to say if this is a symptom of depression). It doesn’t matter what it is, but social mistakes seem to be worse than others. If I say something wrong, or do the wrong thing, I basically have an emotional meltdown. It’s so embarrassing. I have to hide that I’m immediately fighting tears and it’s all I can think about for weeks. I remember every embarrassing moment and mistake from my whole life in vivid detail. Even if it’s an honest and understandable mistake that anyone would make, it ruins me. But if someone else were to do the same thing, I would never judge them so harshly.   

Here’s an example: when I was 8 years old, my mom went to pick something up from someone who lived in a house I’d never been to. She left me in the car, and told me she would be back soon, but she was gone longer than that. I got worried and went into the backyard of the house I thought she was at, and started playing in a little kid play structure. A lady who lived there came out after a little bit, freaking out at me. I panicked and asked where my mom was, and she made me go out front, and found the house next door where my mom actually was. She chewed me out, then chewed my mom out for leaving me alone, I remember really clearly “Your DAUGHTER was TRESSPASSING. Do you know how dangerous that is?” My mom tried to make me feel better but i was inconsolable. As an adult in their 30s with common sense, I know she was at least a little in the wrong to have such an angry reaction about a lost kid. But when I think about it, I still hate my child self, and feel beyond embarrassed.   

These days when I say things or do things where I’m totally in the wrong, I lose it even if other people are being objectively kind or correct in their criticism. It’s caused me to drift away from so many friends and activities I enjoy. My opinion of myself is so low at this point I hardly even try to be out or social anymore.    

Is there a name for this? Does anyone else feel this or is this just general patheticness? I’ve been told so much that i need to stop saying sorry and get a thicker skin, which just makes me feel worse. I don’t know what to think anymore, and I’m so, so tired of just existing at this point. I’m exhausted with the emotional effort of avoiding mistakes, that I don’t do much I enjoy any more.",persimmonsfordinner,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfsmfv/doing_something_even_a_little_bit_wrong_shuts_me/

I just get home and order my stuff and  sit and think about how to get my shit together but i have no energy because of my anxiety no motivation no more strength to fix it and i feel like i’m spiraling again.. I can’t eat i can’t sleep and even when i do sleep i am never able to find any energy… i haven’t sat down and worked on any of my hobbies  in months and it makes me upset because i want to i just physically can’t and just hate being in this position after fighting for so long to get out of my shitty home situation  

on top of everything i’m going through,
all i see is people constantly debating my existence and identity when i just want to live as a man and that’s all. I don’t  wanna feel scared anymore i don’t wanna be the “trans person” especially with all the idiots online who have completely ruined the movement and made anyone who was slightly ok with it take 5 steps back.. i feel like i was so close to being able to be open about it but now… i feel like it puts a target on my back. I just feel like i will never be able to  say it out loud to anyone but my girlfriend anymore without being a walking trans flag and It fucking sucks…

anyway.. 
just needed to rant . Do you guys have any recommendations of activities i can do at home ? 

Hope you all are doing well and staying safe.",420nug,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfw3zj/i_dont_know_what_to_do/
Just drained,"(Mega-post). Basically what the title says. This summer has been the worst summer of my life, and the 2nd lowest I’ve felt in my life so far. I really just want to use this post as a safe place to vent, I’ve already written in my journal but it’s 3 am and I’m still having lingering thoughts, so hell why not. 

Well for starters I just recently turned 19 on July 29th. I spent my whole birthday miserable, constantly crying and stressing because I caught my boyfriend, who I’ve been with for what would’ve been a year next month, cheating on me. I caught him using dating apps behind my back (again), and not only that but he’d been texting and sending nudes to other people behind my back. This was my first relationship ever and the longest I’ve ever been with someone. We both got through our freshman year of college together, and he’s the only person that’s made my experience a little better. Since we’ve been together we never missed a day without talking until the days following that whole debacle (which was like 2/3 weeks ago). It hurts so much bc he was also my best friend and I trusted and loved him so much, so I feel so broken, betrayed, and naive. At first he tried to say he was using those apps bc he was worried that i was upset bc of our distance (it was a long distance relationship), and then he came back and said he felt like I didn’t love him as much (which felt like a huge slap in the face because I did anything for him). Eventually he apologized, and I accepted it. We‘re trying to move on and rebuild our relationship but it just doesn’t feel the same. Especially with my anxiety and overthinking getting the best of me since he’s stopped calling me and whenever we go long hours without texting. He works from morning to afternoon so I try to be very understanding of that however within the hours of us not texting I’d see him actively on social media. Well anyways we got into a disagreement yesterday because he complained about the way I texted, and I brought up that situation again. We haven’t texted since last night. Ik this sounds dumb but I’m worried it may now be officially over, and everytime I say that my stomach drops bc he’s the only person I have left, and the only person I feel close to. 

So that took a big toll on me. And now I feel so alone because I’ve pushed everyone out of my life, the little friends I had, him, everyone. Im very shy, and I have a hard time approaching anyone so I don’t really have any friends or a friend group. I’m very quiet and I stay to myself a lot. The only other friend that I was actively communicating with randomly stopped talking to me and we haven’t spoken since June. I usually always had my boyfriend by my side, so I never felt alone, but now he’s gone too. 

Those were just the major causes of my terrible summer. 

Since I came home from school I spent days/weeks/months on applications and going to interviews just to get declined from every job I applied for. I only recently got a job earlier in the past month at FedEx, and I had to leave after 2 weeks bc the work conditions were terrible. 

I just feel so worthless and lonely. I’ve even let go of my looks bc of how terrible I’ve been feeling. Everytime I feel like things are getting better they get worse, and every day seems to be worse than the previous. Every new person I’ve met has misunderstood me and in turn left, so I just gave up. I’m so tired of crying that I don’t even think I have anymore tears left in me now. I just feel emotionless, just a shell of who I used to be. I don’t even feel like myself, I feel so broken. I spent the whole summer in the house in my room, playing music and video games. Sometimes they help but even that gets boring quick and eventually my thoughts will come creeping back up on me.

And now I have to go back to school in 2 weeks not only carrying this stress, but having to worry about getting out of academic probation. Stuck in my dorm room again just like last year, with no friends, only this time i won’t have a boyfriend either there for me.

I just wanna disappear. It’s 3 am rn and I’m trying to stay up as late as possible so I can sleep all day without having to worry about today’s pain. I wish I could never wake up.

I occasionally have running thoughts about suicide but I could never bring myself to do it bc I’m afraid of pain. 

I sometimes wonder if I disappeared would it really impact anybody, would anyone really care, would they notice I’m gone

I kind of feel bad for posting this here bc it just feels so selfish and tiny compared to what other may be dealing with but I just really feel so lost and have a lot I want to get off of my chest.

Anyways sorry for the long post, I just have a lot on my mind. Also sorry if it sounds like I’m rambling, I’m not good at explaining myself and I usually keep my issues to myself. I guess this all sounded way better in my journal.",Immediate-Craft-4136,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfw3uq/just_drained/
My dreams will never come true,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2015. That wasn't my first episode. The earliest episode I remember was in 2013. No matter what I did, I just could not find the will to do the things I needed to do. No one noticed because I wasn't suicidal and my grades were unaffected but I remember crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't know what was happening to me and there wasn't anyone I could tell. I'm now 25 and I've had more episodes than I can remember. My life is basically falling apart. I don't have the will to pursue my dreams anymore. If my life continues like this, I doubt that I'll amount to anything. There are unread books on my shelves. There are courses that I've not completed. I haven't cleaned my studio properly in a while. I just lay down and cry and cry. Then I start to scream. I scream at the top of my lungs. I scream out the pain and yet it only multiples ten fold. I cry and I scream and I scream again. I live alone in my studio and I've made plans to end my life. Sometimes, I think about my parents and wonder what the grief of losing me will do to them. Yet, I know that they'll eventually grieve on how my life will turn out because I won't amount to much. I don't even want to be much. I just want to be able to wake up in the morning and offer prayers. I want to be able to take my bath and brush my teeth. I want to make a honest and decent livelihood. I want to come home to my studio and be content. I want to take my walks and read. I want to do funny faces with my niece on Instagram calls. I want to sleep soundly. I want to stop crying. I want to stop screaming. I don't even want to be happy. I just want to stop being sad. I am okay with feeling neutral. I don't want so much. I just want to stop feeling tired, sad, weak, hopeless and worthless. I just want the barest minimum. And I take my pills every single day. I take them because I want to be hopeful. On the few good days, I try to get some air. I try to eat my fruits and veggies but nothing works. I'm always back to square zero. I'm never going to make it out of this hell.",abikenani,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfjinq/my_dreams_will_never_come_true/

I can't handle this anymore,"My sweet amazing perfect girlfriend just lost her dad and we're on a break so she can focus more on herself. I feel like it's because I'm too much and I'm scared that she's not going to come back.


 I've always had a good life, nothing to complain about, but a month or so ago I started having small depressions and crying randomly which I've never done. I would come on this sub and read other people's posts and I found myself relating to a lot of them. After my love and I went on a break, I felt I had reached a breaking point. 


In about 18 hours I started burning myself and vaping until I was so buzzed I couldn't feel the burns. I've never don't any of that before. I made an appointment with a good therapist but the appointment is on Friday and I'm breaking down, I don't know if I'm going to make it until then.

mega vent,"my brother has been behaving in an aggressive/thuggish manner for the last 3 years now, he's disrespectful with parents, aggressive, wants to do whatever he wants and to be given whatever he wants, otherwise he'll snap and start shouting and being aggressive, leaves the house dirty (kithcen all shitted up with food and never clean), wakes up my parents every night in the middle of it, literally every night basically, bc he watches tv and is loud when cooking at 3am or doing stuff.

my parents in my opinion handled this in a stupid way, they just talk, complain to him, tell him what to do/not to do(like he cares), then start arguing even between the 2 of them bc they told him to do 2 different things they disagree on, then start discussing, my brother goes out with subhumans lowlifes, sells drugs, gets drunk, steals cheap stuff or alchol from stores.

my parents refuse to expel him from the house , especially my mother, bc hes 17 so she says that he'll get caught by the police for something and then they'll call and they'll have to take him back otherwise theyll get sued for abandoning him, but also even when they can be ""relaxed"", better said left alone, they sekk him because ""he's still our son"", so for example this exact night as im writing to vent, as of 3 minutes ago: my brother came home drunk, they told him to go to bed

etc(thats the main thing bc he always wakes them up so they want him to sleep, also he sleeps all day till 12/16pm,), he refused and an argument ensued, also thanks to their retarded way of

handling the thing which is ranting on what he has to do etc and venting their stress, while he doesnt do what they told him and it happened that it got physical once and he assaulted my father

and then i intervened and assaulted my brother, then my father said he was having a hearth attack and we stopped) anyway in the end they managed to make my brother go out of the house, so what does

my father do after 20 mins? he goes out to search him, different variations of this have been happening literally on loop almost every day for the last 3 years, my parents arent divorced but

just in the eye of the law. note that i assaulted my brother 3 times, once he shitted up the kitched, i asked him to clean, he refused smugly, i snapped and started punching him in the ribs,

not even a fight it lasted 30 seconds at most then we separated, another time i came home from running and came to the garage and heard spitting sounds and saw a light on inside it, it was

my brother with a friend and he was spitting inside the garage, it was closed, i told him to stop and he again refused smugly, i opened the garage and punched him in the face and a fist fight

ensued, it lasted some minutes and i knocked him down kinda once (when you see all the white stars and jump a second forward in time), then my mother came home from work and started shouting and we stopped.

then the third that i mentioned earlier he assaulted my father after the usual shit bc my father snapped this time and punched him, i came downstairs (im usually a passive listener to the

arguemtns bc my presence would only worse things, especially given how they want to manage the situation). i called the cops i think 2/3 times saying he was assaulting my father, they came 45 minutes later and he was either gone or

they just brought him to the station, and the let him come back the same day after a few hours, they dont give a shit about the whole situation, but if i killed him then they would care and

actually arrest me the faggots, my parents even called the cops saying he had drugs (true) and they didnt arrest him bc that one time he didnt have it (my parents found it multiple times),

he got arrested for stealing a shirt, did nothing, so basically for the law you just have to be a passive and do nothing, bc if as i said killed him or if my parents abandoned him, its probable

/sure they'd do something this time, especially the first case. i can go live alone (im 20) but im doing uni and here in italy id be a wagie forever if i go working now (i know bc i already

worked and am currently, in the last 3 years summers, this included, i worked, and the pay is miserable for full time jobs, like 1000euros/months if youre lucky, otherwise less, for full time,

if you go in the trades you can make slightly more but have long ass hours, but in general all those arent things id want to have to do for the rest of my life), also yesterday he came knocking

on my door at 00:40, i made the stupid error of opening, he wanted me to open the house door so he could go out do his stuff, i refused, and he insisted (its favourite method, to just tire you

down until you concede, my parents always do so it works for  him, especially my father so he always asks him), i refused bc i hate him, he sat on my chair and said he wouldnt leave until i

said yes, then started saying that i've always bullied him since he was little and always beat him up (false, when we were little it happened we had little sibling fights or that i hit him

because he annoyed me on purpose sometimes, but it was rare, often we played toghter too so its made up and exxaggerated), anyway he then starts saying he can have me killed by his friends

with just one phone call etc, then challenges me to attack him and fight him to remove him from my room since i asked him to leave, we stay there a couple of minutes in silence looking at each

other and i think what to do, assaulting him doesnt seems advantageous, i see it as a 50/50, not good odds, then i decide to fake conceding, i take the keys and tell him i'll do it, he starts

going downstairs in front of me, i tought about kicking him down the stairs and then beating him while he was down but he was suspicious and kept looking behind him, anyway he went take his shoes

and i locked him out of my room and the upper floor where my room is, he snapped and started screaming and saying hell kill me etc, i called the cops again, (btw i have no faih in them theyre useless

faggots, but i always hope something happens and they finally arrest him or shoot him, like if he assaults them(which he half assedly did multiple time btw), ah yes also one time he was arrested

bc he beat up a guy while he was out idk the detail, he said the guy was making fun of him, people called the cops, he assaulted them, got handcuffed and brought to the station, released same day,

meaniwhile i was behind a wall behind the door with my bowie knife in case he broke in, a tactic i already used with succes is to close my bedroom door to make him think im loked in then hide

behind a wall or in the adjacent room or something like that, the other time he fell in the trap then my father calmed him, this time he didnt get inside. i sincerely would like to kill him

myself, the problem is the probability of getting away with it are slim and i dont want to ruin my life forever for that, so idk, i try calling the cops when he snaps but they dont do shit, arrive

45 minutes late, or like today they dont even come after saying they will, (ofc they know our names from the previous times so when i call they know what it is and they avoided it this time)

also theres the excuse of mental illness and that he takes meds, goes to the psycologist and psychiatrist, so hes not a subhuman piece of shit but hes mentally ill (depending on my parents

mood its one or the other but their actions indicate the mentally ill thing is what drives their actions since they keep staying behind him).

so idk i hate staying at my house, when i hear a voice while at home i get alerted and have to go look whats going on, i always lock my door when i sleep, i have the desire of killing my brother

and stab him while he sleeps in the neck multiple times, most days the evening is filled with adrenaline and tension because of the stuff that happens, and also i dont like how i am bc at the

moment im being a subhuman that goes to bed late, plays alot videogames, and doesnt study, i like reading books but i rarely do, i like going outdoors but i rarely do, i have no friends,

but i have a gf lol, im being shit at uni, im behind with exams, and feel constantly unsatisfied by myself bcause of those reasons while also doing nothing, also i stopped working out, before

i was ripped as fuck, i did competitive boxing, then the will waned and i stopped, now i work out rarely like 3 times a month i go running but thats it.

my only consolation is that at least im working, btw the first year i got scammed and worked 10/11 hours a day for 3 weeks as a waiter and got 200 euros, the year after i did real estate agent 5 weeks

got 1000 euros, fine, but my parents stopped giving me allowance(200/400 euros every 3/4 months because i make it last, btw they complain if spend them on stuf i like such as milsurp gear instead

of what they like such as restaurants, which i love but theyre expensive so i dont want to blow my money), anyway i made my 1000 euros last like 5 months including a vacation but for the rest i

didnt buy anything i wanted like a retard so its like i didnt work, bc i knew they would give me allowance again if i finished them. now i worked in a warehouse for 2 weeks approx but the manager

was a retard and snapped on me bc i asked him info on the contract he offered me since it was very different from what we had talked about, so i left, at least theyll pay me the weeks i did,

or so they say, now i have a cushy job i a restaurant of people i know, i do part time 4/5 hourse at dinner usually and they pay 35/30 a day when i do the whole 4/5 hours (today there wasnt many

people so i only stayed 2 hours then they closed so i got 20euros), its cushy, pays kinda well, its close to home, but they close in 2 weeks plus they already have a waiter but hes on vacation

so idk if itll keep going after the summer. anyway thats my wall of text vent bc i have no friends and my gf already knows all of this and i dont want to repeat it to her a 1000 times plus

shes not well at the moment with health (nothing serious) so i dont want to burden her, oh and to add to the misery my father has a spine problem so he basically almost cant walk, at least 

without huge pain so theres that, i always hear him moaning and suffering when he moves.",---x0x---,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfmj6u/mega_vent/

"It's pointless, and sometimes insulting.","I'm growing tired of the concept of getting help. Therapists, strangers, family, whatever. It just frustrates me. Any disagreement with my declaration of hopelessness and suicidal desires just feels like invalidation and nothing else at this point. I feel incapable of explaining anything about myself in a way others can comprehend. My words don't feel valuable anymore.

Oh well, everyone wants to be a hero. Let's not pretend like some of the 'helpers' out there are doing it for others out of the kindness in their heart. A lot of it is just for themselves. You ask for help and you probably get a comment or a DM, you respond to it, then they cease to exist. Maybe you get some back and forth for 2 minutes if you're lucky.

Or even worse, you're on the brink of ending your life and this is the kind of savior complex regurgitated bullshit you're met with:

*""Please don't leave* 😔 *I care* 😭 *I promise it'll get better* 😊 *Work out* 💪 *Smoke weed* 🥰 *You'll get through this*❤️❤️*""*

Isolation and compartmentalization ruined my relationship with my family,"Hi. I’m gonna vomit because I need an outlet.

Rough childhood. Youngest to 3 older brothers. Shit hit the fan when I was young within my family. Just one example: I was born during the trial for my grandma’s pedophilia (I was not a victim, my brothers were). So, now that I’m older, I’m realizing all of my terrible depressive habits have been implanted since day 1 because they were survival mechanisms for the shit show that was my home life. 

I hate myself. I have dirt poor self-esteem. My life is incredibly compartmentalized. And my form of self-harm is being a workaholic. I don’t do anything I love. I can’t bring myself to. But most of all, I can’t have a relationship with my parents. 

My family is significantly better now. Every family member in my life goes to therapy (except for me), my parents are incredible people and I’m so lucky to have them because they were able to personally change and provide for my brothers and I, even through the traumatic events. All that to say I want a relationship with them. So. Badly. I love my mom and my dad. But I haven’t told them that since I was a literal toddler.

I think this stems from compartmentalizing my relationships. I was (and still am) the good “normal” child, unproblematic, high achieving, classic case of stuffing my feelings in a suitcase and not revealing any of them. My relationship with my family is very transactional as a result. It’s hard to describe, but I feel like a burden if I’m not just a ghost. I know it’s irrational, but my brain is like: 
- Mom: generic greeting
- Me: cannot respond to greeting even though I desperately want to. I simply ignore her.
- mom: “how was your day?”
- me: “fine”
- “any plans?”
- “No.” 

You know how it goes. It’s extremely cold behavior. They don’t know me. I don’t smile around them. They don’t know my hobbies. They don’t know my favorite foods. I can’t be a person to my parents. I just can’t. That’s not what my brain thinks our relationship is for. I exist to make their lives easier. My friends are the people who are allowed to “know” me. Not my family. Graduating high school was terrible. I hated having to be the object of my family’s attention with no way to circumvent it (I’m the only one of my brothers to graduate high school, so it was a big deal for them). 

Anyways, exposition over, here’s the current issue: I’m young. I’m 18. I live with my family. I’m about to move to college in 2 weeks and forever not be a kid anymore. So, I want to make the most of these last two weeks. I know they’re precious. I don’t want an emotional repeat of my graduation. But I can’t. I can’t open up. I can’t walk out of my room and just spend time with them. I can’t have a conversation with them. The thought of doing so makes me so uncomfortable. 

In general I’m in the dumpster right now, mentally. Feeling hopeless about my future, especially with regards to my interpersonal relationships. Any consolations at all would be appreciated because I have the opportunity to change my life once I move and “start anew”, whatever that means. Thanks for reading if you cared to. If you’re struggling too, I hope we both find our peace and our zest again.",IMSORRYMOMRIPBERKELE,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfubxp/isolation_and_compartmentalization_ruined_my/
"Whenever I reflect on my life, it's one L after another, worthless even.","Just turned 20 a week ago. But some background first. As a child I was abused, beaten, and pressured to perform well at school despite my ADHD. I was beaten to the point of hospitalization, witnessed the attempted suicide of my beloved father, and eventually lost him when he jumped off a roof. I was diagnosed with Major depressive shortly after. I did well at school but choked my college entrance exam, so now I'm in an associate degree program, in hopes of getting back into university.

Til now I've never had a girlfriend, I peddle the story of ""my dad forbidden relationship til I was 18"" but that's bullshit. All my friends are fucking their brains out in university, waiting for a cushy job after they leave, while being on 4 different antidepressants has rendered me impotent at 20, and I'm stuck in an associate degree and missing a father.

To top it all off, I was pretty good looking back when I was 16 or 17 at 72KG. But after COVID and the isolation of lockdowns, my depression kicked into high gear and I started to eat and eat, until I'm currently at 100KG, and with a fat face that ruined any chances I have with any women.

How many more Ls can I get? I've watched my friends surpass me in every way imaginable. In academics, romance, achievements etc. While I'm here in the bottom on my fat ass ranting on reddit. 

I contemplate suicide every single day. The only thing keeping me alive is family. My mom used to beat me until I can barely walk.

Job hunting while depressed - a rant,"Just needed a place to say this. Job hunting while depressed is a serious trigger. I had mentioned to a friend that I was burnt out at my current job, and starting looking in a completely different industry. It just so happened that his brother had a connection in one of my dream job industries, so he told me to send my info and resume to his brother, and his brother would ""put me on top of the pile.""

I'm sure I don't have to tell anyone here that -- between the burn out, the imposter syndrome, and the depression -- just getting a decent cover letter written was a fucking roller-coaster. How are you supposed to convince other people to give you a chance when you have nothing good to say about yourself? I deleted and retyped the thing probably twelve times. It still sort of sucked, but I sent it anyway. And now I feel like I'm putting my friends' brother in a weird spot, because he said he'd help me out but what if he sees my stuff and thinks, ""she's got no experience and very little going for her, she's got no chance."" But he has to ""put me on top of the pile"" anyways because he said he would.

I realize this is just the depression talking, and that worst case scenario is I just don't get an interview. But the whole time I just kept thinking....... *I'm depressed because I'm stuck in a job I don't really want, but the depression is making it so hard to get out of that job. So I stay, and I get more depressed. And it's even harder to get out.*

I wish there was some sort of industry made specifically for depressed people. Where getting a chance at an interview doesn't depend on how much and how well you can brag about yourself. And interviewing well doesn't depend on how good you are at bullshitting and spinning words.

I guess thats the end of my rant. I think I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep.",talks_to_inanimates,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfprr0/job_hunting_while_depressed_a_rant/

Help?,"Edit: I managed to clean most of my room, taking a break as it’s 10 now and been cleaning it since 6 :) The fruit flies are still literally everywhere but they should die now considering there’s no food


S Hello friends w depression, I wanted to ask if this happens to anyone else.
I have severe chronic depression, mostly from living w an abusive family who treat me horribly and used to beat me as a child. I’m trying to get out, I actually have a job interview on Tuesday which I am looking forward to, but the aftermath of my depression room has started an infestation of fruit flies.
I can hear them buzzing around me as I sleep, has anyone else had this..? I tried to confide with my abusive mother who recently moved in w me and my grandma after being kicked out bc she believed it’s okay to not pay her rent and thought she was invincible, and instead screamed at me bc the flies were coming out of my room. 
I just wanted her to ask if I was okay or something, but that’s literally never happened before so why would it now? I’m going to clean my room properly, top to bottom today, in preparation for a new life. If I get the job from the interview I’m moving out. Nothing can save me from my depression if I stay here. I’m constantly traumatised, having ptsd flashbacks, surrounded by the people who caused 98% of my trauma. It’s gotten worse since my parents moved in. 

There’s literally hundreds in my room, and it’s disgusting.. I disassociate in my depressive episodes so I can’t remember how I got here. One minute my room was clean, the next I’m sat here tonight surrounded by hundreds of them. I don’t realise it till it gets To this point.
All of my issues will be solved once I move out, I’m generally a happy person, I just am always afraid to leave my room so I keep food and hoard it in my room.. Which causes flies.",Mysterious_Load_3759,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfp00p/help/

I'm just so lonely,"First off: boring exposition. I was bullied for most of my adolescent years (around age 10 to 18) and missed out on any social experience you'd probably have in that time. Then I switched schools and things started looking up because I got a fresh start and somewhat managed to hide my social incompetence. I at least made some superficial friendships that didn't last past graduation. Right after graduating I started having chronic pain that lasted for 2 years and left me bedridden for ~6 months while the few people I was still in contact with at the time moved on with their lives. After I somewhat recovered I enrolled in university but was too socially awkward to make any new acquaintances.

So here I am 4 years into uni: I'm in my mid 20s. The only ""friend"" I have is someone from university but we basically don't meet outside of study groups. Never been in a relationship or anything of the sort.

Don't have any real hobbies and basically nothing to do outside of university (no courses this semester) and work (I come in maybe once every two weeks when there's something to do). Most days I wake up, turn on my computer, turn it off again 10 minutes later because there's nothing to do and just lie in bed waiting for the day to be over.

I can't find the energy to do anything. I moved into a new apartment a few months ago and it still looks like I just moved in because I can't motivate myself to unpack my stuff just so it can sit on a shelf.

I'm just so lonely. Whenever I do somehow meet new people its mostly through others and I feel like I'm always just the ""friend of a friend"" that is instantly forgotten afterwards.

I don't know if this makes sense, but: the only joy I have experienced in recent years was when I could help the people around me with their problems, but there is just no one around to ask me for help.

I know the ""obvious"" approach would be getting into a hobby that allows me to meet new people but I either can't find any interest in a new hobby or I'm too terrified of those kinds of social interactions.

I don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings. My relationship with my family is too superficial and I don't want to lose the only friend I have left. I've tried getting professional help a few times over the years but I couldn't even get an appointment with a therapist since they were always overwhelmed with patients, so I gave up on that. I've been prescribed antidepressants before for my chronic pain but I honestly didn't feel any change in my emotions/mindset/motivation.

I'm constantly getting disappointed at the things and people around me which only cause me to fall deeper in to the though of not trying.

I can’t hold conversations anymore, I struggle making eye contact with people, and I feel like I’m stuck cycling between feeling sadness, helplessness, and despair while shutting everyone out  for a week or two, and then feeling angry and short tempered coupled with a feeling of invincibility and “betterness”(?) that ramps up and usually leads to drug abuse. I feel so far removed from reality and I’ve fallen into the can’t wait to die/incredibly scared to die trap.

Staying Employed With Depression,"
Sorry if this is a bit ramble-y. 

  I started this job a while ago; my first job out of school. It's BARELY in my field, but I really don't mind the work. Unfortunately, my department head is another story. He's abrasive to say the least. Ya know those awful intrusive thoughts that tend to stick in your mind? It's like he knows them and uses them like weapons. It doesn't feel like ""critique"" but more like hardcore criticism of my work and myself. He'll compare me to my more established co-workers, offer little reassurance or praise on my work, and will degrade when possible. He doesn't believe I ""look mentally ill"" because ""I'm just so put together."" However, he has told my co-workers that I'm mentally ill and on meds (I hadn't told anyone about the meds and told him that I'm depressed in confidence.) Sidenote: I put a whole bunch of effort in my appearance, in hopes that I'll feel a little more confident while going through my day. It almost kind of helps.

I've only been here a few months- not even long enough to justify a resume spot yet. It's so hard waking up to go work with THAT. He dug in enough where I had a full blown panic attack earlier this week and it's really been affecting my morale. I've barely been holding it together. Yes, it's a job during a recession. Yes, it pays bills. I should be happy, but I feel my brain getting worse and worse. I've job-hopped in the past (usually due to me not taking care of my mental health) and I don't want to quit this on a whim if my boss is the only bad part of the job. Still, it's hard when I work like 6feet away from the guy.

I don't see the point of living anymore,"So...basically what the title says. I have always found it difficult to find happiness and I've always wondered what the point of life is. If I don't enjoy life, why should I keep on going? The only reason I am still here typing this useless post is because a) I have failed to kms previously and b) I find a bit of strength to keep going because of my dog. Although sometimes when I'm looking at my dog I feel enormous amounts of guilt and sadness because I feel like I don't deserve her. I often apologize to her for me being the way that I am and that she is so unlucky for ending up with me. I do everything I can to give her the best life possible but I just can't shake that feeling.

I have been in therapy since I was 16 and I am now 27. There have been little bits of progress in those 10 years but still I feel like doing the world a favor and just end my life. I guess the biggest thing I achieved was me sort of quitting self harm, and that wasn't even because of myself but because I got put on meds to help control the urges. I still have the urges every now and then but even when I hurt myself I get angry at myself for not doing it ""good enough"".

I have failed in everything I have tried, didn't finish school, never really had a job, no hobby or whatever that excites me, never had a romantic relationship or friends for that matter. Basically I have always been alone and don't have much hope that it will change anytime soon. I don't see a meaningful and successful existence in my future so I am struggling a lot to not just jump in front of a train and get it over with. I suck. I just fucking hate myself.

I'm watching a stupid show and drinking strong vodka in the middle of the week,"I have everything that I guess I could ever have asked for at only 23 years. I'm engaged to a good man, we are buying a flat together, I'm running my own small business, bought my own car and living in a beautiful beach town... And yet I am so lonely, depressed and hurt, I can't even really experience the joy of anything.

He is out tonight, I said it is fine to go and enjoy his time. I want him to have fun. But I am in such a bad place at the moment. I finally got the courage to see a therapist, I'm on depression pills,sleeping pills. It's not working much. I struggle with dissociation disorder, depression, extreme anxiety and panic attacks. Had a very abusive past from the man I call dad. Emotional, financial, physical, literally everything except sexual abuse. He adopted me, he and my mom told me that they gave me a better life I could ever have with my real dad. I'm not so sure anymore. Though my real dad doesn't sound too great anymore. He was bad to my mom but I'm trying to build a relationship. And because of my innocence and past I never knew how bad the outside world can be as well. It made me the victim of sexual and emotional abuse by an ex. I was so broken. I am struggling to find any purpose in life.

Tonight I am feeling so alone and broken and in need of someone just to be here to just understand and listen. To tell me F@ck the world, I am allowed to be mad. But I have no one. I am completely alone in my pain, trying to keep up with my life and the world.

I feel so quilty for not really feeling anything about this great life that I have. I'm sitting alone, drinking my vodka and smoking, hoping it will quiet the bad voices. I want to cut myself up so badly but I've seen how much it hurts my fiancé. I can't even do that. I want to walk and walk until I can't anymore and just sit there until it all ends. I am so lost and lonely.

I just want it all to end. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing is helping. I just want to know how it feels to be alive and in the moment. But I feel so dead. I would have died already if it wasn't for the quilt of what it will do to the people loving me.",Broken-bits,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfg2n2/im_watching_a_stupid_show_and_drinking_strong/
struggling with everything,"I have dysmorphia, depression and anxiety and it has been raining me lately. Someone on an OLD app unprompted (I didn't message them) decided it would be really nice to message me and tell me I'm really ugly. So that happened. Made me feel even worse about my body and issues haha. Have lost myself in this illness yet again.

Does anyone else get periods of just being an absolute ghost in your own body? I feel trapped but wakeful at the same time. Can't sleep, my appetite is either insane or non-existent, constant mental pain in my head and chest. I've had this for 10 yrs now and it has taken everything from me. My physical and mental health, my body, my friendships. My happiness and my passion and my drive. All gone. I feel so close to the end and I have felt this close two times before and both were significant sustained periods of intense low mood and pain and grief. I know that it will improve eventually, but every single time it wears me down closer to the bone and I am scared that one day it will happen again and I won't have the strength to come back from this. Or the people around me to help me step back from that fine line. 

I feel like I can't say any of this to anyone close to me. I wish I could, I love them all so so so much, but I don't feel that they would respond well to this or be up to it. It is an insanely difficult period for everyone involved. I wish this meant something. That this suffering wasn't for nothing, but it is. It's senseless suffering for no reason. And for me it makes it so much harder. I hope that people out there can fight their battles and win, I hope that I can too.

I am stuck for positives right now, but I think it's my nature to try to find them, and I guess one is that it gives contrast to moments that are good, and helps me appreciate truely what I want and what I value. Even so, this illness is a living hell, and I pray that nobody I care for ever has to live this life like this. Its so lonely, painful and just frankly sad. I try to be a positive happy person whenever I can, and appreciate those moments, but the older I get the harder it has been to look beyond towards the future. How can you even begin to plan  a future when you have no idea if you'll even get the opportunity to have one? 

I wish I knew that my friends and family did care for me, and that they truely know that they are the only thing keeping me here. I am thankful to have these things, they have given me so much strength to fight, but I am so tired and want to rest now. I don't know what to do anymore.

How does one even come back from this?,"For some context to this, my parents and I have had a mostly great relationship, and I am honestly more than thankful because I know people who don’t have the same thing.

I sometimes forget to do things or do them wrong, honestly a bit too much, and and it’s made the relationship between me and my dad a bit tense, but today, any good relationship I had with him is simply gone.

I’ve also always had a lot of self-esteem issues. I mess up a ton, berate myself for everything, I’m never good enough for myself at anything, and it’s a never ending cycle that I just cannot seem to break. 

Today, I accidentally scratched someone’s car a bit, no damage, just a bit of paint, not too crazy. My dad was displeased, understandably, as he would have to pay out of pocket, and this isn’t the first time, it’s the second. Again, I understand why he’s annoyed, and I hold nothing against him for that.

After the fact, I called him about something else and he began lecturing me, and he said something to the effect of “you fuck up all the time” and “you’re not going to make it in this world” and that just simply broke me. I haven’t spoken to him all night and I don’t plan to for a while. I fucking cannot believe him. I don’t think he understands how messed up that is to say TO YOUR KID. TO YOUR KID THAT YOU KNOW HAS THESE ISSUES, WAY TO FUCKING AMPLIFY THEM YOU DIPSHIT. I don’t think he’s remorseful at all.

I don’t know what the hell to do. No apology from him will ever fix what damage he just did to me. Telling him seems pointless, even if he becomes remorseful, those words will sit in my head for a long time.",mewtationssb,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfq3cz/how_does_one_even_come_back_from_this/
Is there a point making friends?,"Lately I've been feeling that it's better to be completely alone, I'm not sure how to communicate to people and I think I'm a rather boring person to talk to. I am an artist, but I feel like that's the only thing I have going for me. Most of the conversations I've had are just...awkward, I don't know how to say the right words or carry on a conversation sometimes. I'm usually not around people that much in real life besides my family, which probably contributes to my social anxiety since I rarely go out. 

I do think being depressed and having mood swings most of the time also affect my ability to have friends, I'm not sure who would want to talk to me. I don't think I'm a toxic person to be around, but I don't know, I'm just starting to think that it's a good idea to stop talking to people. I'm only able to speak to people online, but it seems rather useless to me now. It doesn't help that I feel lonely all the time, and I get jealous of people who find it easy to make friends and keep them.

Turning the switch off and on.,"I've dealt with depression since my early teens. It started slowly then spiraled out of control to the point of self harm. I meet my wife and the love of my life in high school. We were one year apart both in age and grade level. Now I am 30 and she is 29. We have been together since 2008. Well about 7 years ago my depression got bad enough I was close to ending it all
 But the thought of the pain I would cause her stopped me and that's when I decided to make it happen. I buried all my emotions deep and turned the switch off that made me a caring person, towards her and everything. It turned into this soulless and emotionless thing. Well in 2016 she got pregnant and I was still the same cold person. It was bad enough I felt nothing when my daughter was born. It took me almost 2 years to feel something towards her. But it was not enough, since the while time it had been putting a huge strain on my marriage. I cared about my family but it was hard to show it, and I couldn't not see my whole world crumbling around me. Well, fast forward to today. I recently made the switch turn back on. And everything has come pouring out, like the walls of a dam breaking. I am feeling things i haven't felt in a long time. I even remember what it felt falling for my wife back in school. Unfortunately she has decided that we need a break. More that she needs a break. And well we decided to separate But I am devastated because I don't want to loose her even though I think is too late for that. I want to win her back. She and my daughter are my whole universe. I wish I would've seen it sooner. Also the depression came back even stronger with the headaches that I used to get when I was young. No meds can make them go away. She tells me that we can start over as friends again untill we both have worked on our issues and then we can see where the future takes. The only thing I can hope for is that my future involves me growing old with her. But with everything in my mind and all I've been feeling. It feels like a loosing battle. Only thing keeping me going is her and our daughter. But there's just only so much fight that a person has in them. I will trying to keep going.

Reasons for past self harm and current depression,"Originally i Wasn’t suicidal but I had depression, my parents put me on Prozac which acted as a activator for suicidal thought and depression for me. I was on it for about 2 years before my family found out I was cutting and was leaving deep scars on my legs that are still very visible till now. It calmed down for A while but then I got into a relationship and i started on my arms and I wasnt connecting the dots that the relationship was why I was cutting again. Eventually I realized but I was lonely and I decided to stay decpite the pain I was causing myself because of it. I was ruining myself because I had these 30 minutes of happiness a day when I was holding her but then I eventually ended it. I was still depressed due to a different ex’s very controlling friend staring rumors that I raped someone because I didn’t want to date her instead. But fast forward a couple months and my parents signed me up for martial arts. I did it for 6 months then switched due to that martial art not being as traditional and diciplinary as I was looking for. But in the end martial arts is whats helping me everyday. Even tho, im still having trouble finding genuine people to talk to and it hurts. When i try to talk to people ab this they call me an incel or pick me and it also hurts more than people think.    


I am adopted. I had abusive bio parents and so thats all my sister and i knew. We got taken from our parents and were taken in by my bio aunt and after a little while she couldnt control us due to us hurting eachother because thats what we were around. My sister and i got separated for 13 years. Still havent seen eachother since but even tho i don’t remember a thing about her, i still miss her snd feel that until i meet her, if i can ever find her, i will always have a peice of me missing.

Another height story,"16M here and im short. Im not super short, but im below the average height. I don't want to go too into detail about it, but it really sucks. I have to deal with all my once (no offense to anyone) borderline midget friends growing taller than me. All my younger and older friends are taller than me and I barely make the cut in being the tallest in my immediate family. I can't fathom how everyone I know has short parents, but all of them get to be the average height. Wtf did I do to deserve the ""short straw"", as some say. With society in America considering height more and more often it's just embarrassing to exist. I'd like to not be lonely, i'd like to be seen as useful. I mean I try to hide feelings like that, but I can't help but want to not be seen like this. And I know there are pros and cons and theres a bright side, but I don't care about any of that. I just want to be normal. Im already as average as it gets, why do I need to make it below the cut in any regard. Also as an insult to injury kind of thing, I had a physical recently.

Please help me,"
(Senior in HS)
     
     So i’ll start this off by saying i don’t remember most of my childhood. 

     I think i have a lot of issues, I remember getting crazy good grades in early elementary school (All A’s in 3rd even) but i specifically remember always hating it. I had a shit teacher or two and i generally didn’t like it. This has only gotten worse over the years. Of course, middle school was even worse. I straight up don’t even remember hardly any of grades 6 - 8 apart from band class. 

     Then I started high school. Honestly i don’t even remember a lot of that either mainly because it was so boring. I almost failed 2 or 3 times. I have no idea what i’m doing. I almost failed Spanish last year just barely getting a C or D with my moms help. I got her help the last couple of times also. 

     Let me talk about my parents for a second. They’re kind to me most of the time, but they’re a little strange. Firstly, as a teenager, they seem kind of unfocused when it comes to me. Not neglecting but just a little absent. Also my mom can get stressed sometimes and my dad gets stressed if anything is even slightly wrong with my mom and in general can be a little touchy. I’ve grown to be repulsed at the idea of talking to them about this. Mainly from an incident of me talking to them about possibly being autistic/adhd and them shutting it down immediately, and from me becoming a bit cynical from all of this.

     I’ve been rotting in my room every time summer comes. Its better than school but not by much. I’ve clung to what little joy i have. I feel out of mind. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to talk to my parents about it because i have no reason to believe they’ll do anything about it. I’m stuck.

My Friend was Assaulted and its My Fault,"A few weeks ago my friend was sexually assaulted by someone I introduced them to. I blame myself, not only because it was my friend but because I know exactly what it is like to be taken advantage of in that way by someone you thought was a friend. I feel like I have been pulled back into the past, to one of the lowest points of my life and I feel so much guilt and shame that I am responsible for making someone else feel that way. I know that I am not directly responsible, logically I know that. But I just keep thinking that I never should have introduced them, I should have looked more closely at past experiences with this person. 

I don't even think my friend is taking it as hard as I am, I was told by a mutual friend that because she was aware of my past experiences she sugar-coated what happened to spare my feelings and wouldn't even call it ""assault"" much less sexual. But she kept blaming herself for what happened and I felt myself starting to boil over because that's what you do when something like that happens, you blame yourself. 

I haven't really talked about my own sexual assault with anyone, my close friends know about it but I have never talked about it in depth with anyone, not even my therapist. Its still so painful and I know it won't stop being painful but I can't let it take me out for this long not ever again.

Venting into nowhere,"Very down today. Nothing new. Just feel exceptionally hopeless. Maybe I am capable of being a normal, functional human. Maybe I have a brain that could be good at my job or any job. I don't know. I seemingly have everything and yet, outside of my beautiful family, it feels like I have nothing. I am having panic attacks left and right. I just feel trapped. And guilty for feeling trapped.

When I was younger and having super dark thoughts, I would tell myself it would get better one day. It was worth waiting it out. Now, I have kids, so they are my reason for not hitching the first ticket out of this place. I'm just fucking tired of being me. I'm going to get myself an antidepressant prescription, maybe it will help. Maybe it won't. I slept two hours last night. I've been working from my bed all day. I think I got out of it once to make myself half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It's now 6:30 and I need to go be a mom and pretend to be happy until they go to sleep in a few hours. Then I'll go back into the guest room and try to sleep.

I'm probably manic right now. I don't know. On paper, I'm manic right now. Hypomanic. Not ""I can fly"" manic. But rapid cycling. And fucking down in a super dark and fucked up place right now.

I just want to feel like I can actually be good at my job. Like I can be like other people who are consistent and smart and liked. I know, just fucking do it right? Why is it so hard for me? Am I just a lazy fuck? Is it the ADHD? Is it that I'm bipolar but no one will fucking diagnose me with it? Is it just fucking up my brain chemistry due to being so sad all the time?

There is a spot in my chest that is hard as a rock. I can't breathe. I want to hide in a cave where no one can find me for as long as it takes to burn through all the cells in my body and be someone totally new. Is there a pill for that? I'm just a horrible person. Not particularly broken. It's my actions and lack of action and all the things. I'll never kill myself, but my self sabotage instinct is strong right now. Yet within all the darkness I've found something that makes me happy, though it's not the thing that should make me happy, and it probably will break me more in the long run. i don't know what I'm doing. Trying to escape but instead running into fucking mirrors and now I'm in some kind of fun house and I don't know how to get out.

The thing about chronic depression...,"It isn't as dramatic as major depression. It can go on for years. My entire adolescence and adult life I didn't know what was wrong with me. 

My life has been a constant struggle to do the bare minimum to ""survive"". On the surface I was an A student and now work a good job, but it's only because I've always believed this is my only worth - being an achiever. I've achieved everything I've dreamed of achieving by this age, and I still don't feel I'm worth shit. 

It's a constant agony putting up this facade of control and having my shit together. I don't experience joy anymore. The best I could hope for is a bit of relief from this pain. 

Sometimes I wish I would just collapse so the struggle would end. Even if it means losing my hard-earned achievements. Sometimes I wish I would just collapse and pack my stuff and go home and sleep in my childhood bed and forget about everything.",purplecubicle,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfiucs/the_thing_about_chronic_depression/
Frustration with the Psychiatric and Mental Health Institution.,"When I was in my early twenties I attempted to kill myself. Before that I struggled with depression but it had gone largely undiagnosed for most of my early life. My mother died when I was young and my father was physically abusive and would not let my wellbeing be a priority. I performed well in academics and with a scholarship and 2 years active duty in the military I paid my way to go to a prestigious college. Unfortunately my depression rapidly got worse after I began. That winter I attempted to kill myself and was luckily noticed by security at the hotel in which I was attempting to do so. I then spent time in an inpatient facility in which I was formally diagnosed with depression and treated with an SSRI and went through several outpatient programs.  


For some, I think that is where the story ends, but not for me; my depression got worse and worse. I exercised daily, meditated regularly, ate a healthy balanced diet, went to therapy regularly and went through more prescriptions than I can count. I was put on multiple SSRI's, an SNRI, a tricyclic, an MAOI and I tried mood stabilizers (valproic acid is *the worst*), anti-psychotics, and Wellbutrin along side my anti depressants. Nothing worked and my anhedonia got so bad that I lost all interest in sex, food, and, well, pretty much everything. I wouldn't eat or sleep for days and I couldn't keep my job. Down more than fifty pounds and on the verge of being evicted from my apartment, I desperately looked for alternatives. I found a way to try ketamine infusions, psilocybin, and rTCMS. None of it worked. At the behest of a fellow doctor, my psychiatrist put me on Vyvanse.  


I didn't expect it to be any different but it was. It was a stimulant and that helped me get out of bed, but more than that there was also a disconnected effect that I noticed even when I was off of it. I had less anxiety and for once in a long time I could *feel* things. I could laugh, I could cry, I could have sex with a pretty girl and enjoy it; my life suddenly had color again. I started working on things that I had a passion for long ago and those passions took off. My passion turned into a job and that job into a career. I met friends and grew close to people. I met the love of my life and moved in with her. I was on the drug for 7 years and my life had turned around. I still had to battle my depression, but it was manageable.  


When mental health professionals learned that I was on vyvanse I would suddenly notice a change in tone, however. ""We are taught not to give stimulants for depression"" they would tell me and they'd say ""you should be careful about becoming dependent."" But those worries weren't consistent with my experience. The SSRI that I took with it had worse withdrawal symptoms and often I would forget to take the vyvanse for several days. It was when I was struggling that it helped and I never felt the need to take more than the low dose that I did take (the lowest available dose).  


Recently my prescribing doctor had fallen ill and became unavailable with no one to cover (due to covid) and for the first time in many years I approached other doctors to obtain my prescriptions. As a result, I have basically had to go cold turkey from all my active medications. Even when I was just asking for the lexapro (which really fucks me up with withdrawal), the fact that I even mentioned vyvanse would cause hesitancy. One psychiatric nurse, without asking about my mood, well being, or history simply stated that I shouldn't be ""trying to get speed from doctors and should consider rehab."" When another doctor suggested several medications that I had already been on with no benefit (cymbalta and then nardil) and I expressed reservations, he pushed back and said that my lack of openness was a sign of drug seeking behavior.  


The experience of constantly being told that the one thing that has worked for me makes me a drug addict has put me back into that place I was seven years ago. I feel like I am alone again in that apartment helpless to this illness which is once again consuming my life. I have been off vyvanse for 3 months now and I can no longer have sex with my girlfriend. I struggle to feel anything when she tells me that she loves me or when I see the smile of my niece. I have no interest in my passions again and my chess set and laptop have begun getting dusty. Once again, I am going through a bunch of crazy medications which are doing everything but helping. I feel like I've been run through a sham. I feel like the big difference between back then and now is only that now my depression impacts and hurts those that have come to depend on me.  


I am now desperate again. I have obtained ketamine and adderall and tried both and neither have helped. I am considering going off of my anti depressant to try psilocybin and am starting to look for places that offer ECT and rTCMS out of the country. Increasingly what I have discovered and the source of a lot of my frustration is that my interactions with the psychiatric community have grown to be somewhat toxic. I genuinely do not feel like my current psychiatrist wants to help me (he doesn't seem one bit alarmed when I inform him of my increased suicidal ideation and simply wants to cycle through SNRIs, tricyclics, and MAOIs regardless of their impact), and I've been called a drug addict by more than one mental health practitioner.  


What is most alarming, however, is that in conversations with others that have drug resistant depression, I have found a similar theme. I have met, at this stages, at least a dozen people who had to turn their entire life upside down and/or do something illegal and dangerous just to get treatment that worked for them. I have met folks who cannot afford ECT and rTCMS and cannot function without it (both with and without psychotic symptoms). I have met several people who have been forced to grow or buy their own medication illegally (and at least one person who had legal trouble as a result). I have met others who have the same experience with vyvanse (many of which have faked ADHD in order to obtain it). Why in this day and age, are there so many of us that have to operate outside of the system which exists to help us *in order to get help*?  


TLDR: I was taken off the medication that worked for 7 years, called a drug addict, and now am struggling to fight my depression. In my desperation to get help, I have been surprised to learn that many others with similar depression have resorted to illicit or extreme measures to get the help that they know works for them.",throwaway56473846238,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfnqqk/frustration_with_the_psychiatric_and_mental/

After I get done with my hw which is the first thing I do when I get home, I either workout if I didn’t have a heavy session in weight training today or just practice boxing. After I get done with all of that the lonely, numb, lost feeling comes back.

I have a girlfriend but like we can’t really hangout anymore because one she always wants to work like everyday at her job, only days she really has off is Tuesday and Friday sometimes. Her mom hates me cause after we broke up and then got back together like 2 in a half months ago she told me that her mom dislikes me now and yeah. i feel like our conversations get dry, I love her very much and she always tells me she loves me too and is always the first one to FaceTime me at night. But I don’t know how to explain the feeling it’s like a feeling that I’m unsure and I feel like it’s not going to be the same and I really want it to be cause I know god didn’t just bring us back together for no reason like I love this women man very much but I can barely see her.

I feel like I should be doing more throughout the day and if I just sit in bed I feel like I’m just wasting time.

I really need advice on where to go right now I feel lost in my life right now doing the same things everyday and feeling the same way like I want to feel better than I did yesterday I just really don’t want to feel numb right now I want a better mentality where I can go throughout the day without thinking my girlfriend is doing me wrong or im not gonna be able to do this and that and thinking negatively.",heradderal,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfnm27/i_feel_numbstressed_and_lonely_when_i_get_home/

I think im getting to depressed state.,"I'll try to make this the shortest I can possibly do, i think I might be depressed, I don't feel passionate about everything in specific, although I am aware I have some interests like running, video games and fitness and maybe other things but I don't feel particularly passionate about those things.

the thing is at this point of life I haven't been working for like a month, basically I leaved my dead end shit job to pursue a content creation online, that so far goes terribly wrong, due to the fact that I can't choose what to make content about, basically I overthink things too much and also the fact that I feel passionless about a topic doesn't make it any easier.

Also the only person I've been talking to every night and only by phone is my mom, right now im living in another country so there's that too, I've been 2 years away from home. which they didn't feel that lonely because in my past job I talked to some coworkers so that made it more bearable.

 I workout everyday, running plus resistance exercises, I guess that's what's keeping me from loosing my mind, and although sometimes it feels like a waste of time, im not planning on stopping that. also I don't smoke, don't drink not drugs, im pretty boring I know XD.

the point is I don't feel like happy at this moment, and I frankly I don't know if I ever will, actually I feel pretty useless, im 35 right know feeling lonely af and like a failure as well

But on my mind 24/7 is the depression I feel like I’m in life but not fully INNNN life, I’m not even thinking about anything else except what the hell is wrong w me and how can I be normal again 24:7. I used to Do things with ease, no thought behind it, enjoying life just living, happy when things good happened, sad when things bad happened. My “depression” consists of obsessing over how I feel everyday, I feel like I can’t fully enjoy things, I’m always on eggshells with my entire life and everything I do. I’m scared my life is over because I feel this way. I started LEXAPRO 5mg 2.5 years ago for health anxiety. That is so far gone. After feeling depressive symptoms I bumped to 10mg a month ago.  I’m not as low mood but now Nothing puts my mind at ease. Everyday is survival mode BUT WHY can’t I just be why am I always thinking about being in life and not functioning normally not caring about things I usually would . I don’t even know if LEXAPRO is the right choice. Did it give me depression? Not sure.

I [35M+] failed at life and it is time to go,"I wont go into details but I wrecked my life the past two years, irreversible, my own fault and actions. I have ASD-2 and I'll be another male statistic on the spectrum sooner or later.

I tried, I swear I did my best having this thing. But at some point you got to admit defeat. By my age and I'm still struggling to function as a member of society, I will never make it, it is too late.

I only wish something like the Sarco Pod was already available for me and euthanasia legal so I can remove myself from this existence and stop being a hindrance to the system and everyone around me.

I deserve a dignifying death too, not a messy suicide with more pain involved and the high risk of failure.

should i feel in dept to my parents ?,"I'm a 20 yo male from egypt
In the past few years i've made myself the absolute parent wet dream
- i don't drink or smoke or go clubbing 
- studying to be a dentist and my GPA is 3.7
- i help with chores around the house ( cooking - cleaning)
- in good shape and healthy ( exercising and playing soccer once a week )
- in the summer break i don't get an allowance but rather work freelance or side hustles to get money to support my spending 
So due to financial circumstances my parents both work and there is always trouple when it comes to spending money ( such as college fees, books, holidays...etc)

My parents always make sure to let me know who spent the money and how exactly it is

How much does one owe the other 

And there are always back breaking comments when i make a mistake 

Gaslighting my feelings and accusing me of being selfish when saying i had enough of the fighting over money 

And due to the package i carry from home i try to be nice to everyone just to get them to love me or feel affection from someone but nothing is all i get ( or even resentment in sometimes )

So i hate this situation and the thought of death being a comfort didn't leave my mind for the past 2 month 

Kinda scared to do it though cuz i feel i've done too much good to leave without getting repayed 

I really miss feeling loved

I feel like I'll soon develop psychosis if I continue living like this.,"Every day I put on a facade for both my family and friends to bear even though internally I grieve and rage at my own situation, submitting into my abusers will and never having the chance to move out or run away, because I'm too scared and the world doesn't run on kindness.

Even now what I wrote feels like an understatement of my own suffering, it's getting worse and worse every day and my anxiety is doomed to shift into even worse symptoms when I grow-up. 

I'm not even diagnosed by a professional but I'm smart enough no one constantly comtemplates ending their life every day and slips into comfort fantasies to cope with their endless days of submission. Maybe I'm too prideful when I wrote that, maybe I really I'm just one fucked up person in reality never loved by anyone and will never have a loving future.

Every time I think about psychosis, I think about that one friend I abandoned. 

The one friend who didn't stop me from indulging into unhealthy fantasies when I was at my lowest point at the age of 12. 

The one friend who attempted suicide six times and still lived on and later taught me lessons to take to heart.

The one friend I misunderstood because I was too ignorant to learn what were trans people and their problems and be kind with them. 

The one friend who tolerated me from start to end. 

The one friend that suffered from psychosis but slowly healed on their own when I didn't do anything to help them back.

She taught me everything, with bad intentions and good. Yet I didn't do anything to pay her back and look at me now. A pathetic human being just moments away from taking their own life, or someone elses.

Question,"I have a theory but I need some info from some participants. Would anyone here consider themselves pure, or closet to it? I’m sure a lot of us are aware we are sinners (if you believe in such things) including myself. Make no mistake this isn’t going to be a Christian post convincing anyone to take the path of god. But this is my question to you. I believe, at least to some people, maybe it is one action, or actions you have take(n) that is a piece to the puzzle of your depression. I have a flaw which is porn related, and when I was in a weaker state of mind I was shamed by as many people as possible, discretely though. And I was convinced I was scum. My fetishizes are noting to be proud of but I know these guys are judging from an ignorant state of mind. So I kept telling myself not to take it to heart and that they don’t know my history nor should I have to explain myself to these people. But I digress, I am mentally much stronger now and aware of such malicious behaviors, and the motivation behind them. But I have been made aware of many things, spiritually, mentally, and physically thanks to such unfortunate circumstances. I do believe this may take part to some people out there that may reside within this group, I don’t want to make this a solid conclusion and would like to hear the perspectives of others. There are things that you have done which may be embarrassing, terrible, or whatever negative thing you can attach to it, but you must know you have to find your place in this earth, and sometimes that requires coming from a dark place to truly know.

I’m not able to focus on my studies like I used to,"
So to put in context, I(25m)  a med student in my final year and I have just 2 exams to complete before I’m a doctor but the thing is, in my university we get to choose our exam dates and we get to change those dates however we wish. Lately I’ve been noticing myself being lazy and procrastinating, therefore I find myself unable to finish the subjects on time.
I’m supported financially by my parents, who are in a lot of debt and who put a lot of effort into getting me to where I am right now. I am hoping to see if anyone else is in a similar situation and I hope someone could give me an advice on how to be more productive ( I’ve tried put up schedules , group studies, white noise, timers...nothing works ). Atm I feel so overwhelmed that I have let down my parents (I have a total of 6 exams and thesis in my final year and I have completed everything except for the two exams left) because of me delaying my exam date, this has brought me to severe depression for the past two years( cz of my laziness I have basically extended my final year to a total of two years and probably will need 2 months extra) 
I was a believer in god a few years ago and I found that faith helped me face exams much better, but I don’t want to go back into religion at all.
I just want to get done with med school and start helping my parents out with paying their debts.

Just my thoughts,"I emigrated to a new country, while I was facing depression and anxiety, financially under pressure, and emotionally I have no one. My roommates don't talk to me because I apparently raised my voice when I requested them to close the door gently at night. A psychiatrist I visited told me to take medicine, I want to but my sister tells me to go to a psychologist first, I did and she also told me to take the medicine while doing therapy. 

I depended on my sister a lot, as I was facing depression for a few years, and I could not do well in my profession, I depended on her and now I feel lost. I am not in touch with my parents, and my sister has abandoned me, she does not talk to me, and she says she can't help me anymore, that I make her sad, and I don't want to. 

I just found a good friend back in my home country. She understands me. But she is also not very well. I can't bother her much about my problems.

I am alone doing things I have never done before, with no emotional support while facing depression, and whenever I want to talk to my sister, she keeps yelling at me ""why are you like this, I have not seen anyone like you, don't take the pills, they are bad,"" and now she has stopped talking to me which I understand. But she does not understand it's not in my control.

I think I should take the medicine, this is affecting me and my relationships. So I can focus and progress in these hard times, I can't control my emotions. I have many other issues rooting back to my family and childhood, I have OCD. Things that I have not worked on for so long, are now like a bomb. With all the difficulties, finding a job, and studying, I am trying hard to hang in there.

I don't know what to do. I think I just need someone to talk to. To tell me to keep going. I feel exhausted, physically and emotionally, and alone. Now I am taking sleep pills.

Everything feels weird. I'm in a mental pit that feels like it should be a puddle.,"Like, I don't even feel sad anymore, it's just this perpetual state of total apathy. I'm functional, mostly, but it's like being stuck in one spot, even though rationally, you should be able to leave any time.

Whenever my anxiety acts up with ""what if I fail this??? What if I don't get accepted at uni??"" or whatever, my instant first thought is always ""well, I can always kill myself and be done with it."" even though I actually don't want to die at the moment.

I'm terrified of dying accidentally or deliberately, simply because of how much I know it would hurt my family. My mother already died, and I'm really close with my sister, so I think it'd hit her and dad the hardest.

I don't feel sad, but I don't feel happy either. There are some videos or games that make me laugh or smile, but only for a bit, yet that's enough to make me feel like I'm faking it all.

I was considering SH again, because I know that would make me feel *something* new at least, but my sober-streak is keeping me from doing it (thank the Gods). 

I want therapy and meds if I can get them, but right now the mere thought of having to talk to another therapist makes me nauseous. Having to find one and scheduling a first appointment already seems like an impossibly hard leap.

Tragedy of my life," Hello everyone who is reading this blog and I understand what you are going through so you came to read my blog I get it! I’m going through a phase  of breakup not just boyfriend but from my families and from friends everyone is breaking up with me making me feel worst about my self. Out of all of this I don’t have anyone to talk yeah I get that it’s very sad but really I don’t have anyone to even talk I stopped talking for a while and none of my family even realised. They put my food near my bed and go I eat when I’m hungry and if they need anything they will ask I just started to show them . If people are calling me I stopped picking up there phones and I’m texting them but they of course call for something they need after it’s done I never hear from them anyways so it’s fine. Only two people will talk to me right now it’s my brother if he is bored and want to use my phone and my grandmother who wants see if did brush my teeth to eat breakfast if im hungry to eat my lunch and if im hungry again for snack and for dinner that’s all I don’t have anyone to talk this why everyone says teenage sucks I just turn 20 just two months ago and nothing good is actually happening except for the worst. 

 I had a person whom I cared a lot about and now after all these years we are not together anymore and I don’t know what to do with my life because I made him an idol every time when ever he takes a decision I would follow it and go on with him now after he leaving me I don’t know what I have to do with my life. now I feel so empty without him I can’t take the stress while being with him and i have no idea what to do with my life anyone 

And coming to my family we are very orthodox family. I turned out to be the odd one out who stopped caring about god due to everything that’s happening around and my mom started to treat me like I’m the biggest sinner in the world and even looking at my face will give them sin (papam) 

My dad goes to work in the morning and comes back really late the only time I get to see him is just 2 hours in that time we eat dinner he has people coming to talk to him in so much more somedays I don’t even see his face even living the same house so I’d not mind about him. 

And coming to me being thin and depressed talking about it like a big joke in india if we don’t eat properly we become thin itseems I eat 4 times a day I eat food at midnight I eat snack all the time my mouth doesn’t stop until there is no more snacks in my house because I buy around 100$ (7000 rupees snacks ) every month so you should know how I eat and I never eat vegetables I always eat meat max 5 times a week I eat meat still everyone who sees me thinks I don’t eat food 

I’m depressed person too i stayed alone for a month in an apartment I cut my hands multiple times and cried every day for 5 to 6 hours a day and my eyes were always swollen so I took good medication and I’m fine now but I don’t think I’m fine anymore staying with 6 people in my house I still feel and I can’t sleep I have a huge void in my stomach and my heart it’s so bad 

About my education I will take time to write in a another blog so😂

Everything in my life is getting so much crazier that I used to have 100’S of friends now I’m just alone 

Life use to be so much easier than now it seems so much difficult that I don’t think I can ever move on with my life anymore

Dishes,"I was wondering if any of you have any tips that help you deal with the dishes. 

I have depression, ptsd and high functioning anxiety. I can bring myself to pick up garbage and throw my laundry in the same mountain in the corner of my bedroom. I dont mind never folding clothes or making my bed. I've come to terms with the depression and anxiety and that this is how I live and get by and what works for me. 

Dishes dont work for me tho. They pile up. I use paper and plastic everything. Its much much more manageable for me to just toss the paper dishes and take out trash. 

BUT, currently, despite using paper (I ran out this month at some point) I used every single usable dish in my house apart from my large mixing bowls. I had some dishes I brought to work but I threw them away because buying a new dish is easier to me than washing them. 

Cant remember what its called, maybe an impossible task? It just feels too big to start and the thought of it makes my muscles tense up and I want to cry. Its frustrating because I can't just set a timer or watch someone else clean to help myself. 

I also dont have a dishwasher...

The ONLY thing I have found that helps me feel better is dedicating a drying rack jut for dirty dishes so I can keep my sinks empty. Makes me feel so so so much better. Still dont do the dishes, but for anxiety and depression, it does great things. 

I am to the point where I almost want to just hire someone to do them. nothing else. Just do my dishes. 

What do you guys do? Anyone else deal with this. I know I'm not alone 

Maybe I should just wash one dish a day. Thats attainable and not terrifying.",Life-Round-1259,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfd2xc/dishes/

Insecurity is depressing,"Sorry for my English, it isn’t my first language.

I moved to the UK three years ago, got a grad job and will be starting in September. I don’t have a car so I decided to move to the town because it saves money on commuting.
It’s a new town and I don’t really know can I make friends there, not to mention finding a partner. And I don’t know am I capable of doing the job.

I miss my friends and family back home because at least my family can help with the housework and my friends don’t live miles away.

"I really struggle with attention, restlessness and concentration","Something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember is struggling with paying attention to things and concentration. I mean I will by trying my hardest to listen to someone, but then realise I've zoned out mid sentence and haven't paid attention to anything they've said. I cannot concentrate on tasks at all, I get distracted by anything or something literally nothing, I end up starting loads of tasks at once and struggle to finish any of them no matter how simple.

I also really struggle with restlessness and patience. I am always moving, it's physically impossible for me to sit still for more than a moment. All this mixed with the fact I seem to have no short term memory and really struggle to get myself motivated to do any task is making my life difficult.

All this started to make me think this was ADHD, I fit the profile perfectly and my brain has been like this since I can remember, before I ever started to consider I had depression and anxiety.  However I spoke to my doctor today and she says it's side effects of the anxiety as I didn't particularly misbehave as a child. She's recommended I start therapy again, which I'm going to start since this negatively effecting my life, and now I think about it has negatively effected me a lot through my life.

Is this something else people struggle with depression and anxiety experience?

The only reason I've not killed myself is my cat,"I genuinely believe that my family, few friendships would not be as heartbroken as they say they would. No matter how many times I've been told so, I simply have not and probably will never believe it.

The one thing that keeps me from ending it all is that my cat very attached to me. The longest I've been away from him was three days and during those days I was told that he wouldn't play, he wasn't eating his normal amount and genuinely seemed upset by my being gone.

He waits for me at the door as soon as he hears my car in the drive way. He follows me around the house, stays in my room with me when I'm going through depressive episodes. He positions himself where he can see me as he sleeps. He meows at me like he talking to me when I cry.

And he is really the only reason I'm living right now. I'm not really close with anyone, not my mom, not my little brothers, not my grandparents, not even my favorite friend.",Mars_The_Dead,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wewg04/the_only_reason_ive_not_killed_myself_is_my_cat/

Also I'm the oldest of 6 and three of them are already out of highschool, ik I need to set a good example too and Im the oldest linen of the bottom of my family tree so my work and stuff reflects on my family ...

M 32 looking for advice how to proceed,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

Hi there everyone. I have reached a situation I don't know how to handle any further.

Some context I am male, 32 years old, live in germany, depressed for many years now with anxiety disorder and social phobia (all diagnosed). I am gay, HIV positive (in treatment) and was always the strange kid everywhere. I also suspect to have ADHD which would explain some of my rather subpar social abilities and me jumping between topics from time to time (sorry if my post gets inconsistent for you)

I visited a psychotherapist 4 years ago for about half a year to try and get me back on track. This didn't help much and the meds I got just made no difference or they made the situation worse even after weeks of taking them. 

After my therapy was ""done"" I drifted a bit not doing much all day. I eventually entered a retraining program to become a tax clerk because it was recommended for me because of my abilities. I successfully ended the retraining and am now an official tax clerk (on paper). This was 5 months ago.

While in the internship part of the retraining I noticed that I am not only scared around/of other people or afraid to look like a fool in front of others, I downright hated it being with people I didn't know much but could tell that they took me for an idiot. It's the way they talk and treat you which makes it obvious and makes me stress even more. They did not burst out or screamed at me when I made mistakes, they just treated me like a toddler with pity in their words. I know I am not perfect and do many small mistakes so they are right to be disappointed. 

This also showed at the final verbal exam for becoming a tax clerk. I was really nervous and when I got my exam topic I managed to focus a bit and collected some key points in the 10 minutes we got to prepare. But when I stood in front of the committee  I just locked up. I managed to spew some words that made a logic sentence which saved me from failing right at the finish line. I could tell the committee was disappointed considering I had some of the best theoretical results of the 50 people they tested that year and they also told me with pity in their words to maybe reconsider my career. I guess you can tell this was the point I just didn't know what to do anymore. I felt, and still do like I am not fitting anywhere.

To add to this I was never good in small talk and always preferred to be by myself so not much of a charmer. I can cooperate with other people and are the last one to get mad at someone. But the more I payed attention to others around me the more I longed to be left alone, the more I hated being with people that are probably just wearing masks telling you you do ok while gossiping behind your back to an extend it would make you cry.

I also became pretty bitter over the past few years and honestly can't find a reason to try to get back into society. I am just tired of people. However after 5 months of no income I reached the limit and as it looks I wont be able to pay for my health insurance this month (15th/16th). I still have meds to treat my HIV infection for a few months but if I get sick because of something else there is a good chance I have to carry the costs with an empty bank account.

I know I can get a job with my qualifications but I also know I won't last long because I will focus too much on other people cues again, losing the will to do anything just being at 100% stress the moment I wake up from my alarm until the end of the shift. But I also know that I am a burden to my family right now.

I talked to my family doctor about getting evaluated from a psychotherapist (maybe the same I was at 4 years ago) for ADHD. I was met with hesitation but I guess in this rural region I live in I am a very rare case. I also talked to my doctor that is responsible for my HIV treatment about my situation because I let slip that I feel PHYSICALLY ok and he kept asking. He proposed that he could get me a appointment in the psychiatric ward of the hospital because he was close with another doctor that worked there.I declined because I didn't wanted to trouble him (knowing fully well I fuck this up too in some way) and I am also scared of the stationary aspect.

I guess that is the Story so far. Now I might condense the point of this Post to one or two direct questions:

\- I know one should never diagnose themselves no matter how much info you gathered but could undiagnosed ADHD be the reason I have so much trouble socially?

\- Also what is the best place to ask for/get help for this in germany?",Ok-Look-3784,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wfh5m6/m_32_looking_for_advice_how_to_proceed/

Whatever happens around me it doesnt have any effect on me,there was allways something that kept me from enjoying the moment.

But since i have moved out of my house for my higher studies, i have realised that the problem is not with the place butwith the person. I thought moving out would change my life, it could cheer me up, that i could reinvent happieness here.

My(17F) dad(51M) is depressed and I need advice or activity suggestions.,"The way he was talking and acting today was too familiar. I only saw and talked to him for maybe a minute or two- it's normal for us, I don't see him often due to his job.

He reminded me of myself today. Or maybe I remind him of me since I'm younger? Does that make sense? I don't know. He plans to cry when he gets home from work on Friday- that I know for sure.

I just need suggestions for what I can do to help him feel better. I won't cure his depression, that isn't how it works. I just need to make things a little bit better somehow. Maybe for just a day or an hour.

Saturday and Sunday. Maybe Friday depending when he gets home. Those are my days off, the days he has off, and the days I plan to just try and do something.  He mentioned dying soon.

even the light has shadows,"I've been dealing with depression most my life like many on here. For a while I was stable in a numb sense. I'd wish for the void  like many have and cried over my failings and everything. But in recent years I lost my ability to hide in numbness.

And with that came emotions and my lose of stability. since then things are better in a progress with growing up sense but my emotional and mental health's been rocky at best.

"i’m in a situation where i’m forced to hold back my depression 24/7 and i can’t escape or get much help, and it’s making me start the slow descent into my 8th major suicidal period in 2 years (life story warning - 16 AMAB)","
I geniunly don’t know what to do with my life anymore.
I’ve thought of everything I’ve been able to - vanlife, tiny houses, unit sharing, part-times, working now (i tried but scored a fast food one, lasted a month, then parents shut the search down as “i was clearly a failure” so yeah) and unfortunately, there’s just so far i can get with physical (cerebral palsy) and mental (ADHD, OCD, Bipolar, suspected Aspergers; BPD, anger issues) disorders, not to mention the same narcissistic, abusive + manipulative helicopter parents (it’s mostly mental abuse now but was physical in the past) and other bullying and all…i haven’t had a sound sleep since age 8 and haven’t been able to go outside without a physical tracker i can’t rid of, govt. services can’t help // get manipulated, all that good shit there…not to even mention the 5 year long anxiety period when I was 9-14 that my parents refused to help me with.

That brings me to now. Been essentially a shut-in and isolated (even at school) at all times at 16 years old, and fearing for any future in this country, due to the fact I cannot afford it and I just can’t stand my diminishing rights. I’ve tried every way to get out, including physically, but that just fails everytime. My friends (that saved me from suicide 7 times) got blocked in Sept. due to “suspicious activity” and I’ve been banned from most socials and lost everyone as a result…not to mention physical deaths.

But I want to talk about a less distant crisis. Lately I have been losing interest in everything. Lately I’ve been struggling to brush my teeth. My severe depression has arrived right on time, and with school around the corner, I’m anxious, nervous and afraid of what is ahead for me. And, my depression has arrived a couple months early. With that comes the tiredness, comes the laziness, comes the oversleeping, comes the fogginess, comes the lack of interest, comes the inability to do chores, comes the no money, comes the no way out of here, comes the fatigue, comes the disconnection from friends, comes the worsening, comes the violence of dreams, comes the school failing, comes the isolation, comes greater familial ignorance, comes the lack of activity, comes the drop in intelligence, comes the unavailability of jobs, comes the worsening of pay, comes the lower intake of food, comes the dangerous anorexia,  comes the hopelessness of my situation, comes the suicide ideation, comes the ignorance, comes the preoccupation with death, and then finally comes The Note within 8 short months.

(I’m living with Ben Shapiro and mega-TERF Mother Gothel. I HATE to bring politics into this but when it comes down to them attacking me day after day for simply existing, then it unfortunately rears its ugly head.)

My grades are slipping further, my home life has worsened (there are fights every day), and any hope for getting out of this country has left the station. I’m broke and will continue to be. I’m just barely holding on, but I’ve noticed a sharper increase in dreams related to death. I have more violent thoughts and urges, and i’m increasingly scared of being around other people. My paranoia has only worsened the amount of panic attacks I get. It gets so bad sometimes I can’t even talk. I have gotten a lot more socially anxious and isolated, in record time too.

I don’t even know if I have a future. I’m pretty sure my (financially) abusive mother, whose birthday is tommorow (yaaay) ruined and mucked it all up for me. A “dream” scenario is honestly, just living in a apartment, maybe less than 250 sqft in a lively city (philly, nyc, portland, whatever), but honestly i’ve just accepted not only will i most likely be forced to be homeless (unless there’s some miracle rent i can score for sub-500$), but i have also accepted the fact that there’s a 90% chance of me not getting out of the USA, 5% chance that i end up some miraculously in Canada, and the remaining 5% goes to, fuck knows, Eastern Europe??? Either way, it don’t look fine in the least for me or any future prospects.

Social anxiety prevents customer service jobs, I’m too stupid and dumb for a mechanical or physically intense job, and some fuck other who knows bullshit excuse to justify almost being on the verge of not being able to work, wich in america, means i end up starving one way or another in any circumstance. I’m just too fucking stupid, not to mention dangerous behind the wheel of a car. I have literally **zero redeemable qualities**, and the immense gaslighting my mother pulls make it somehow negative redeemable qualities.

I’m extremly fucked up and fucked in life, and I’ve known this for a while now, regardless of how I feel about it. There comes a point in time where to you just cannot improve your situation, and for me, my depression just sinks lower and lower. My once-a-month therapist wishes she could help, but with a dead-end future, I ain’t getting nowhere in life, at least from the looks of it. Even in the slim chance I get on SSI, that won’t afford me jack shit. I’ve just got to face it, I’m stuck in this situation because of a lot of factors I cannot control.  I want to comfort in my misery, in my depression, but I want to be somewhere where I can control my environment to make changes necessary. But, right now, I can’t. And it seems only, to be getting worse and worse every. single. passing. week. Add that on top of a pattern of continuous toxic “friendships” that more often than not left me with no constant people in my life other than my family, wich, needless to say, never helped me much else either. nothing is holding me back from getting more anxious, hostile, and violent. i can’t leave maximum security that is my house, but i can’t stay, otherwise i will be driven to suicide ideation like nothing else i’ve expierienced before. the government can’t do shit, my therapist can’t do shit, my familt can’t do shit, my friends (what i have left) can’t do shit, reddit can’t do shit, and i can’t do shit. because i’m so afraid of getting caught and dragged back, like last time, and the time before that. but what can i do when i’m the family jester and the funnyman, and the day labourer whenever they can use me, else they’ll just ignore.

"I crave for social interactions, but I also want to be left alone???","It’s been three years since I’ve got out of a toxic relationship and left a toxic friend group. I was unhealthily codependent and couldn’t do anything alone, I invited friends to even go grocery shopping with me. If I wanted to go to an event but my friends couldn’t or didn’t want to, I would simply just miss out &amp; not go.  But of course, I eventually learned to &amp; loved how it makes me feel. Well, a few months ago, I started seeing a therapist who told me I have the signs of depression &amp; anxiety.

When I do things alone (movie theaters, restaurants, etc), it feels empowering and it makes me feel independent. BUT when I see groups of friends hanging out &amp; having a good time, I begin to feel sad and lonely that I don’t have friends to hangout with or that I’m by myself. 

I crave for social interactions &amp; I want to make friends, but at the same time, when I’m at school or on the bus I just think to myself, “PLEASE! I hope no one sits by me or tries to talk to me. I just wanna be left alone.” 

I even try to make friends online when I have that urge to want to be social or make friends. I’ll respond for a few days. But then I’ll just completely stop out of the blue.

Monday afternoon, I got the news that my grandfather had passed away. He’d been fighting cancer for the better part of 20 years, but this turned out to be the last round. His health had declined pretty quickly over the past few weeks and he went onto life support Sunday night. My dad and his family made the decision to turn off the machines Monday morning. The doctors said it would probably be maybe minutes before he’d be gone, and true to the super-soldier he’d always been, he hung on for another few hours. I’d like to think he heard the doctors say that and went “oh yeah? Watch me.” He went peacefully and hopefully without too much pain.

Why does it always keep getting worse? When will it finally be okay? When can I finally stop feeling like I have a hole inside me that just keeps growing and growing and taking more and more of my soul and myself away from me? I remember hope exists, but it’s really hard to keep that in mind when everything in my life is so broken, empty, meaningless, joyless, and takes more from me than it gives back.

I feel so goddamn empty right now. I almost got off the bus at the wrong stop because I had genuinely forgotten if we’d already passed my stop on the way to work today. I’d forgotten that I was even on the bus. My mind is so cloudy and vacant, and yet all I can think about is how terrible everything is. My coworkers even agree that I’m not really in the right state to even be here, but I literally can’t afford to not be here.

I feel like giving up. I know that I can’t. I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.

I think I am coping with depression since the beginning of time, there's always been something wrong with me since I was little and I am living my life more for inertia than actually enjoying life, I am questioning if it really worth living like this.
In the last months I matured the idea that for depression there may be a treatment but no healing, there is no such thing as full recovery. The only thing that will ease the mind of a depressed person is death, as the end of pain.

Just need to get this out there,"I don’t feel like I have anyone I can talk about this with, so I just want to get this off my chest.  I’m 32, I’ve always been an overachiever, a real go-getter, but I’ve struggled with depression since I was 13.  It wasn’t so bad when I was younger, but I feel like it’s progressed to the point that I don’t know myself anymore.  My current decline started in 2019, I was in an abusive marriage, and the wheels were turning that I needed to leave.  After the divorce I thought things would be better, but instead I just got really unstable and engaging in questionable behavior (from a safety perspective).  I went from being a workaholic to not going into work, smoking too much weed, and spending too much time thinking about sex (maybe from the sexless marriage?).  I was laid off, found another position, worked okay for a bit, but then I was in a volatile relationship, and my two best friends cut ties with me because of the relationship.  Since then I’m hazardously spending money and not going into work.  Every day I keep visualizing (and “feeling” in my minds eye) various ways that I’d like to hurt myself (ways that would inevitably end in death).  I don’t think I could ever kill myself, but I just realized I think I’m subconsciously killing every good thing in my life.  I can’t take my own life, but I’m doing a helluva job taking my own livelihood.  I don’t even know how to fix this… you can lead a horse to water…

Therapist says they can’t help,"I’ve had a few types of therapy for depression over the years (about 15), including a few rounds of CBT. 

One therapist I had spoke about herself for long portions of our sessions. One was a student and I think a bit overwhelmed at the time. One time I had 10 sessions where the therapist said nothing; I’d simply sit in the room with them and cry for 50 minutes, then repeat the next week. Recently I tried hypnotherapy and on our 4th session the hypnotherapist said she couldn’t help me because my hopeless world view was too strong. 

One time I “shopped” for a therapist who I’d get along with well — by having lots of intro sessions with different therapists and picking the one I liked the most. After about 15 sessions it was clear we weren’t making any kind of progress. 

It’s hard not to see that I must be the problem in at least a couple of these cases but I don’t know what else to do. If they give me homework I do it. Everything they ask me to do in the sessions, I do it. Visualisations, gratitude journaling, regular exercise etc. The main thing that could be a problem is that sometimes I doubt that they can help me. But it’s hard to have hope when A you have depression and B you remember failed therapy experiences of the past.

Now it has been feeling a lot more inconsistent. We haven’t had sex in a month and I don’t really feel desired because she doesn’t make much of an effort to show she cares sometimes. 

We check-in here and there about the relationship and even though she says she’s interested/likes spending time with me, sometimes I just wonder if it’s true or not.

We got together in Spring and he's warned me for the last couple months that this was coming up. I've always promised him that I'm not going anywhere and that I can handle it, and I haven't had any trouble with these promises.  


However, he's been sick (we're not sure what with) for the last week and a half and it's setting off his Depression really bad which is understandable. What's troublesome is that he's shared that he's worried he won't be able to shake it before September hits and his S.A.D. starts to kick into overdrive for the next 7-or-so months. He's suffered from these conditions throughout his entire life and I've known him for some time before we started our relationship though never this intimately (he'd disappear for long stretches of time, now I know why), so I've no reason to doubt that his concerns are valid.  


My question to you all is fairly simple... What should I do? How can I help and be there for him? He gets agitated if I ask him how he's feeling too often, especially if I pry for details (not because he's hiding anything, he just starts feeling like he's at a doctor's or being interrogated by a psychiatrist, which I get 100%), and if I ask him what I can do to help he changes the subject and ignores the question or he tells me that I am helping by doing whatever I happened to be doing at the time (lately it's gaming together or watching movies). I know I should rely on his word but he's flat out told me that he's not comfortable asking for help and when he's down like this he doesn't even feel like he's worthy of help or any type of positivity..  


So yeah, any advice on how to possibly help him feel more at ease during his darker times would be appreciated. I really care about him so I'd appreciate advice that is productive to the relationship's longevity, please.

Booked a trip for 18 days and just know I'm going to be miserable,"I don't have anyone to travel with. I end up having to do most things by myself. I have only been out of the country once and decided to try to do a trip to a few different cities across Europe. I'm regretting it all now. It's too much, I'm going to be gone 18 days but I have no one with me at any point. I'm sure I will meet someone to talk to here or there but no one to share these memories with long term.

I don't even have anyone to call and send picture to, to talk to and talk about my day. I'm just alone. I'm really regretting this. I feel so overwhelmed doing this on my own and knowing that it's going to be all on my own I don't want to go.

Im having really bad thoughts on top of it. My best friend stopped talking to me again. They need space to figure out their life but told me that they don't know when they'll be able to talk to me, most likely when they get a more stable living situation but that's at least December.

I can't even talk to my best friend about any of this anymore. I tried ending my life a few years ago and the longer.life continues to be this lonely, the more I regret not just ending it all.

I haven't been in contact with my best friend for a long time now. We stopped speaking for over a year. They were going through a crisis and that is kind of why we spoke again. Their life seems to be getting better. They're interviewing for an incredible job, and even if not they're making great money. Why do they need me anymore? They need to figure out life but they have a lot of good going for them and I know if I'm in their life I'll fuck it up. Anytime I'm in their life it tends to go south for them. Just like this time when they spoke to me, their life fell apart right when we spoke.

Maybe it's better if I don't exist so I can't hurt anyone anymore. I only seen to be a burden on people's lives. I'm.tired of being so pathetic.",invisiblewar,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf3tox/booked_a_trip_for_18_days_and_just_know_im_going/
"I'm in immense pain, I'm at a loss for hope, and I'm very tired.","I feel completely hopeless. I remember being a sober, promising new talent. Everyone was behind me and I felt invincible. Then I went through shit that no person should ever have to, and then started to recall things that happened to me as a kid, and then started to be seriously affected by those experiences and developed ptsd pretty bad. I still can't be around fireworks, and backfires set me off. I wound up starting a career path that I had wanted since I was a kid and it means nothing to me now. I'm a functional drug addict and I'm stuck working 12 hour shifts at my lab, then I go work another 4 programming a lims system for my lab which I may or may not even be paid for. Any free time I get, I'm either *not doing illegal shit* or using what came of that to escape reality. I'm working my life away, I'm haunted by people I care, and I nearly being murdered, and then having to go on to be the fixer to save everyone. As soon as everyone was safe and the situation was settled, most of my friends were gone. I travelled to see what I learned were distant Qanon crazed family members. They accused me of being some drug lord and forcibly hospitalized me after being invited to simply come over to visit. They said they were helping me get away from my family who they more or less described as the sopranos. While hospitalized, I was stripped by cops in front of a crowded waiting room, locked away and when I asked for anxiety medication to take the edge off while they were attempting to find a legal reason to hold me, they gave me an anti-psychotic. That combined with my ADD dropped my dopamine levels to essentially 0. I for the first time in my life honestly felt suicidal the minute it kicked in. I sat locked in a solitary confinement cell in a psych ward for 10 hours listening to the sounds of violent mentally ill people screaming things like how as soon as the door was opened she'd cut our heads off and rip our intestines out. Eventually when they concluded my health was fine, I had no drugs in my system, was not mentally ill, and I had zero risk of suicide they begrudgingly let me go onto the street of a town I didn't know 100 miles from home. Thankfully my ""mafia"" family had heard of what happened and were already in town to bring me home. They all have there own problems though so there weren't many chances to speak of my experience outside of what was said, how audacious the betrayal was, and trying to sort out if they were going to lie to police and attempt to get out house raided by cops. To this day I've only ever even spoke of this to like 1 person who was in no position to be supportive. I got out of *Not illegal activities* and continued chasing my dreams of becoming a scientific researcher, but was yet again cut down when I had to get someone I cared about off drugs before they self-destructed. Months later, holding down my first lab job and saving her, I was let go after being abused on the job. They threatened to fire me for obscure, unexplainable reasons so I took notes on exactly what I did throughout the day. When they tried to fire me for not doing enough, they then shifted to it being about me ""wasting time taking notes"" while he tried to hold back a guilty grin. It was the day before all these extravagant benefits he promised would have kicked in too. I was pushed back into selling *baked goods* and quickly started consuming as well. After many months of learning to program and nearly giving up on my career dreams, I finally got a break at new lab. A few months into that and things with my girl get worse and worse until she ultimately attempted to poison herself and jumped off a bridge. She was in a coma for a few days, but thankfully woke up. Now I sit here, high on, well tbh I couldn't realistically tell you what drugs are in my system because I just reach for it like someone would reach for a coffee as long as im not on the job. I've been priced out of my entire state. I'm probably going to have to leave my family and go who knows where. I might have to go back to *not illegal activities* to simply afford to live in poverty. I've already lost a lot of weight from starvation. My girl's sister said I looked like a POW. Honestly I feel completely hopeless. I don't want to be sober because all it is anymore is pain. Physical pain from 16 hour work days, and mental pain from running into everyone elses burning buildings to save them, while going home to my own burning building. The difference is nobody is coming to save me. I kinda just want to die and finally have peace.

I wish I wasn't the problem,"Even tho I know I will end up alone, like always, and unhappy I keep trying to make things better. I stand up for myself, I work out, drink water, try to be more social, go out for walks, play with animals, volounteer etc. It always fail.

I suck at socialising. Don't even get me started with that. I hurt my ankle and after I'm healed I've already lost the motivation to go to the gym, I barely get myself up in the morning. One bad day of eating can cause me to lose motivation and eat more than I should and unhealthier for months. I start projects and never finish them.

I have \*no\* friends. If I were to want to go out with someone , I wouldn't have who to call. There is one girl from class who I hang out a decent amount in school and she's nice so probably she would say yes.

Randomly during the day I'd realise how I'm completely alone, useless, unmotivated, underaverage and lose all motivation I have. I just don't want to struggle like this for 50 more years. I can't sleep often from overthinking. I feel pathetic that the only thing I look forward in life are video game events, some shows, books and manga. I feel even worse when a story in game makes me feel so many emotions (happy or sad), more than I ever felt by something in real life.

I used to be very happy about vacations and holidays and I'd be the driving force for organising stuff for them in our home. For about a year and so I just felt..indiffirent. Because of that everything was half-assed and done literally day before. The only nice thing about them were gifts and food.

I always feel either indiffirent or sad. I just don't want this to be my entire life.. I want to change, but I don't know how, or if it's even worth to try. It's a fact that there are people who live to be 70 and never had a friend or a partner. What if I'm one of those people, just at the start of my ""journey"" and not at the end..?

A night I can’t forget,"This happened years ago but it sticks with me and it still plays in my head in the most vivid detail.

The years was 2007 and I was 18 years old living in a small rural town. I had just gotten off work just before 11pm. I was headed to a friends house who was having a party. I decided to take some backroads just so I could relax and unwind bit before I got there. One of the roads I took was infamous for speeding because it has many steep hills, known by some as “Rollercoaster Road.” It’s a typical country road with no yellow lines and just barely wide enough to accommodate two cars going in opposite directions.

I was on that road for 15 seconds before I noticed a strange orange glow illuminating the night sky. When I came up to the top of the hill I was on, I saw a small car completely engulfed in flames sideways blocking the road. I parked on the roadside about 60ft from the car. I stepped out and was immediately hit with an extreme heat. In movies, people could be close to something like that. I learned what Hollywood magic was in that moment. I called 911 and got out to see if anyone needed help.

While outside of my vehicle, I could hear screams. The likes of which I haven’t heard before or since. Nobody knows what there reactions will be in any situation. I took an opened bottle of water, doused myself and ran towards the car, as I got closer I began to hear the screams from the opposite side. Inside the car, there were two occupants. Obviously deceased. I made my way around the car. On the other side is where I saw an early 90’s f250 slid off the road in a barbed wire fence. Numerous people injured. Two other occupants from the car that had made it out. I knew them. They were injured, but not life threatening. I learned the truck was traveling the opposite direction as the car. The car was speeding down the road. Went off the pavement, over corrected, slid sideways and was T-Boned by the truck. I heard a woman screaming she couldn’t find her kids. They were in the bed of the truck before the accident. The kids were thrown from the truck and had landed quite far away in the grass on the roadside. Lifeless little bodies. 

Emergency vehicles began swarming. I ran back to the guy I knew. He kept trying to crawl to the car. Screaming the other occupants names. I had to help the paramedics hold him and calm him while they gave him meds to make him less resistant. 

Soon thereafter, a tow truck operator showed up. A close friend of mine’s father. I waited with him for the fire to be put out. Once it was safe to approach the vehicle, I went with him. Not really thinking, just telling what I’d seen and knew about this accident to this point. Once by the car, you could see the remains. The horrid smell of burnt fuel and human flesh. A sight that’s seared into my eyes as well as my memory. 

I left. Went home. No party for me. I took something to help me sleep and woke up the next day. I had texts from many friends informing me that one of my best friends little brothers was killed in an accident last night after leaving a party on a beer run. Naive me thought that there were just a lot of accidents that night. No. Only one. The charred remains of the front passenger that I saw belonged to my friend. I didn’t even know it. I’m thankful for that.

Other people my age learned I was there. Everyone had a hundred questions about it. I couldn’t sleep for weeks. The sounds of a mother panicking over her children, the screams of a friend that just watched our mutual friends burn, the smells that can’t be forgotten. I tried talking to my guy friends but when real emotions began to show, I got the “be a man” stuff. Female friends were even less help. Feeling alone, isolated, guilt over not being able to help the kids stacked up and I purposely od’d. It’s a miracle I’m alive today. A lifelong female friend came by to check on me randomly and called 911 when I didn’t answer my phone or door.

I’d rather die than grow old,"Just a thought so I’ve been thinking abt this and I just had this realization that me being 18 is temporary and that I’ll grow old, weak and wrinkly. I mean I’ve thought abt growing old before, but specifically like right now this aging thing hit me. I can’t imagine being rlly old yk? Tbh I’d rather die than grow old, be weak, and have limited things to do when ur old. fuck that.

It sounds so shit laying down on a hospital bed or a retiring home all day. Dying of old age has got to be the worst death of all. I like death, death comforts me since I’ve thinking abt suicide a lot, so I’d rather kill myself before I grow old and die. Heck If I was given a choice to stay young AND depressed forever like i am right now, I’d take the opportunity. 

Tbh I don’t even think I’d reach being old lol (im 18) I’d probably have killed myself already or the earths inhabitable cos of climate change.

I don’t know if I’m over-reacting over a bird or not.,"So I know many people are scared of pigeons, crows, etc…, but I’m not. So I was really excited when my Mom said she brought a pigeon home today and it’s in a bag outside our home. My brothers didn’t let her bring it in because it’s understandable why and they’re also germaphobes. She brought the pigeon home because she saw it just sitting in the middle of the road and many cars nearly ran over it. Being the super religious Buddhist that she is, she pulled over and brought it home. 

We had plans to nurse the pigeon back to health. I was really excited! I gave it a nickname- PiPi the Pigeon and wanted to secretly bring it into my room. While my mother went to get some stuff, I sat alone with the pigeon and watched it’s breathing. I remember thinking/ wondering to myself if it was breathing so hard because it was going to die soon. After cleaning it’s wound, we tried to give it some water and rice. It drank some water but wouldn’t eat the rice. 

My Mom left to run some errands and I went to watch to watch some TV. I found some sunflower seeds and went out to give it to the pigeon, but I was shocked to see that it had died. I really didn’t expect it to die “under my care”, even though I didn’t do much besides cleaning it’s wound and offering some food and water. I’ve chosen fish at the counter and watched videos of people killing chickens for food. I live in Asia so I’ve seen pig heads in butcher stores and whole birds in the display glass for roast meat stores. But when I saw the pigeon lying there so lifeless and limp yet stiff, I couldn’t help but cry. I feel so sorry and so much regret that I didn’t come out to check on the pigeon more frequently. My Mother seems Ok now but I’m still really bothered by it. I really had hopes that the pigeon would be ok after a few days. Am I overreacting again? My depression has gotten slightly better over the last 3 months with a few incidents here and there. I haven’t been able to stop feeling sorry for the pigeon for the last few hours.

Thank you for reading.

I want to disappear for a bit,"So I'm a 23M living with depression my whole life. I have taken steps to improve my depression and anxiety. For about half a year I was in a polyamorous relationship with my gf of 5 years and a girl I met online. It was hard to come to terms with what I was doing, even hiding it from family which caused strain.  But I fell for her and the whole relationship. But a month ago she broke up with us because she wanted to work on herself and figure out what she wanted. This decision was after a week of her deciding what to do because another person kissed her and asked her out, it was hidden from me for a week before that. She promised to still be friends, but hasn't talked to me for a month because she doesn't want to hurt anybody anymore, yet I see that she is still hanging out with the other person. I wouldn't care, but she said she was going to take their time away from them to work on herself. It hurts because I still care, and I feel like I'm the only one that does. She even messages my girlfriend from time to time. Now my GF and I are taking a break, so we both can work on ourselves. This month has been tough with one bad thing happening after another. I'm in therapy now, and talked to a psychologist for his opinion on better med options and boosters. The thing that shocks me is that he said I'm on the cusp of developing borderline personality disorder. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sticking with these things but I feel too far gone.

"I feel like I'm a failure nonstop, which makes me depressed","Hey

I feel like I need to speak up and lift the heaviness of my thoughts off my shoulders. 

I am 22, living in a Caucasian country with strict requirements from males; they must be strong, don't show emotions, and be true leaders. If they see even the smallest sign of mistreatment, they must fight immediately. Well, I don't fit in this category. I don't have an experience of such things. A calm person by nature, I would rather talk things out than fight over them. 

My father has never supported me in any way. We live in the same house, but we never speak to each other. I basically have no support except for my mother and sister. In recent weeks, the thought of me as an adult has crept into my head: I need to take responsibility for my family, I need to protect my sister; I need to behave more mature and more like a real man. However, no one showed me how to do that. I've never been in a fight and am unsure if I will be able to protect my closest ones if needed. I always escape from taking on any sort of responsibilities because I am sure that I'll fail them. And the meeting of these 2 thoughts of me being an adult and not knowing how to behave properly make me really depressed. It's already a week that every time I try to do something, the thought of me being helpless and sort of a loser doesn't let me finish anything.

I also have very severe social anxiety on top of this, so I feel like I am letting my family down by not being a good support system for them. I feel like a real failure.

I just really need a male role model in my life to rely on, but there is no one. My father is not interested in our family, and I have no brothers. Only friends with whom I  will feel very ashamed to talk about this.

I was always aware of the type of my personality, but I don't know why my mind focused on my disadvantages for the past week literally non-stop.

Not sure if anyone felt the same, but any response would be very appreciated.",Alternative_You9485,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf9gy3/i_feel_like_im_a_failure_nonstop_which_makes_me/
Recently off meds,"I really feel like I can't be happy ever.

Weird thing to be depressed about,"Over the years Ive been depressed on and off about certain things but this one thing that happened recently has been affecting me to a level that I did not expect.

It honestly embarassing to talk about because its so little in comparison to the major things that can happen to people that can affect them.

A couple months ago I got burned on my body and it left a mark about the size of a dime. That shouldnt be much of a big deal but for some reason the look of it just really disturbs me. To the point where Im even suprised that its bothering me this much. Its iust this ugly dark purple/black color that just looks terrible to me and makes me feel so uncomfortable with my body. It feels dissapointing because just when I was starting to get comfortable with my self and relaxed this happens and makes me feel constant self concious tension that is lingering that I can never seem to ease. 

Im hoping it fades away but if it doesnt im really seeking help on how to psychologically process and view this so it no longer bothers me. I know its most likely not normal to be this disturbed by something as miniscule, and I recognize that but it doesnt change the way I feel. I really need some advice on a perspective I could take that will make me stop having these feelings",Low-Bat2170,14,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf8mdm/weird_thing_to_be_depressed_about/

got my drivers license today and don’t feel any better,"maybe it’s because it happened so unexpectedly quickly today, rather than it happening after having to wait until after lunch. i was surprisingly able to just walk in and get it done right away. or maybe it’s because i had immediately made a poor decision after getting my license, where i pulled out in front of someone when it was the better decision to wait, due to my nerves still all over the place i guess. i feel so much guilt and embarrassment when i make any mistake. especially in front of my mom who has a lot of anxiety sometimes. i didn’t back up perfectly straight either during the test, which made me feel embarrassed. i can care so much and so little about anything sometimes. i’m 18 and have struggled with driving for a while, so this should be a big accomplishment, but i just feel the way i always do. i know i shouldn’t be surprised. i just want to sleep really. all it means is that i will now need to get a job that somehow allows me to avoid my emotionally abusive ex i’m still terrified of, and i’m sure the completion of that will feel even less accomplishing than this. it all is what it is, it’s just life. constantly stressing over productivity when productivity means nothing to me. it’s just doing what others expect. i dunno why i feel so down",acid2skin,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf8bak/got_my_drivers_license_today_and_dont_feel_any/

11yo foster daughter is showing signs of clinical depression,"We are foster parents. We just received a placement two weeks ago for two sisters 11 and 15. The 11-year-old is really struggling hard. Obviously, any reason why a kid would end up in foster care is sad and terrible. Situational depression is very common and I'm used to dealing with very sad kids. 

However, last night, in tears she started opening up about feeling sad all the time. And as she cried and talked, I realized that we were probably dealing with something else besides situational depression. She described being sad, even when good things are happening. She talked about how at school, she is always anxious and hates being in groups. Sometimes she will go cry in the bathroom and gets bullied on the regular. It also seems like, because she is so emotional, the teachers don't take her very seriously and disregard her when she feels bullied. And she mentioned having felt suicidal in the past, but that she liked being alive, she just hates feeling so sad all the time. ""What is wrong with me?"" she asked through more teas. ""Why can't I ever feel happy?"" There are also additional trauma-related issues that we are seeing that are concerning as well.

The soonest appointment I can get for this kid is August 17 and it's just a preliminary visit to set up mental health services. I've already been warned that the wait for a therapist is months away. What do I do in the meantime? How do I help? I'm really good at advocating for my foster kids so I'm wondering if I need to push harder to get her therapy sooner. Obviously, these are all red flags, but in foster care, most of the kids are dealing with mental health issues so getting CPS/DSS to move faster is very difficult.  Is there anything I can do to help as a parent, as I wait for therapy to start?

I got everything I ever wanted.,"For a long time now I wanted a lot of things that I used to not have. Friends. Success. Love. Social adeptness. 

I grew up as a loser throughout school, spending most of my time gaming and as an outcast. Eventually I discovered the world outside of computers. Parties, friends, love, the outdoors and the gym. But all the years of lack of self care made it so that it took me a lot of effort and time to get to where I am today.

Today, I'm well on my way to my dream career. I'm super fit. I have great style. I have an easy time with girls. People I meet think I'm cool. I get invited out to parties on a daily basis. People respect the person I am now. I'm proud of the person I've become.

But it doesn't make me happy. I don't want more. I just want to be happy. And I'm not.

The worst part of depression for me.,"Personally, the worst part is knowing that I in fact do have the power to change my mind and my habits, but completely lacking the energy to do it. Depression has entirely robbed me of the ability to make the necessary changes to get over it. I feel like there is a creature living inside me that knows I can kick it out at any time. And I should, because it lives off my misery and self hatred. So it takes all the energy I could use to get rid of it, and turns it into impotent anger that has nowhere to go except deeper inside. And I feel worse. I feel lazy. I feel helpless and pathetic, because I can't do the most basic things an adult should be able to do. I can't help myself. I can't even get outside to find someone to help me help myself. 

Everything that I can think of to point out a reason why I can't is just an excuse. A lie I tell myself to hide from the fact that I'm just lazy, pathetic, and helpless. I should have been put out of the world's misery years ago, because all I am is a drain on their resources. I am a parasite. I don't have the energy to help myself, and so I leech off my friends and family and give nothing back.

At this point in my life, I am actually feeling pretty good overall, and am currently not on any medication for anxiety and depression.

Or are these depression signs I’ve noticed just coincidental changes I am going through, gradual lifestyle changes, or whatever, that happen as people age and grow? Some of the “signs” I have noticed lately include a lessening of body hygiene standards, a lack of interest in some of my formerly favorite hobbies, as well as sex, and romantic relationships altogether, less of a drive to pursue/achieve life goals.

My heart and soul are giving up,"The past years I have learned so much about myself, much about what I don’t understand, mostly with what I love, what I hate, what I like, what I dislike. I’ve always been a girl with a heavy soul, bringing a heavy baggage wherever I go. I learned that I will never be happy until I accept what happiness means to me. In my world, however, that’s slim. I learned wherever I go, home or outside of home, I will never find what fulfills my soul. I always end up losing myself. Moments where I thought I had it, moments I thought, this is it. But for some reason, I already know what’ll happen with my future in that circumstance. It’s like having a deju-vu a year later, as if I have been in that position.

Trust me I know, I have tried many times to fix myself. I couldn’t. I don’t know really what people think of me. I’ll just go with the obvious “She’s too dumb to do anything with her life I can see it” I played myself dumb in front of people, I played this characters people wish of me to be; only to downplay and self-sabotage.

Am I overreacting?,"I have chronic depression (since I was 11yo). 
I’ve been through therapy and still occasionally go when I need it. I learned to manage my depression well but when I get triggered, stressed out or just out of nowhere, I still have very depressive phases. 

Like I can’t even get out of bed to shower or do anything but stare at the ceiling. 

The situation:

I’m on an amazing vacation at the moment. My triggers don’t exist here and I do what I love with the people I love 24/7. I’m feeling great and I’m feeling a happiness I’ve never known.
Still, I know to be cautious because for me the tables can turn very fast (I’m at a point like this right now)

So I texted my dad about how happy I am here and that I wish life could always be like this. And how much I appreciate everything and everyone here.

He knows I have chronic depression and sent me this cheesy picture with the two people riding a bus. One facing the scenic beautiful window, the other sitting there miserable staring at the stonewall and the sentence „Every single day you make a choice…“
Then he texted me, that I just have to choose to be happy and have to make the right decisions in life.

Honestly that kind of offended me. I didn’t choose to be depressed, it’s an illness! I can’t choose to be happy when depression strikes me down.

So I answered that that’s kind of offensive and is one of the absolute no gos when talking to someone with depression.

He told me that he knows people with depression who would agree with him and totally love that cheesy picture and that it even helped one of his friends with depression.

I (17 M) have fallen down too early...,"At a such young age, I went from a normal teenager to the most depressed student in my high school.  Literally, I am the only student in the class that sits alone. Not that my classmates don't like me as some have tried to show sympathy to me but after many of my mental breakdowns and holding of the tears out of fear that I would be called ""weak, foolish, retarded"", I have reached the point of no return and no escape from the darkness.

I was not bullied in elementary school or high school, I don't know whether should I attribute my blame to the parents who have ""forced me to control my anger"" knowing that it is not the correct answer to dealing with your inside problems because it would only be worse. I do admit that my parents are not good at helping me understand life except when they refer that life is never balanced which is true.

I even failed to fulfill the goal to keep in contact with my classmates because none would have ""Free time"" to hang out with me even if it is Summer break. I want to treat them with good respect because in the end that would be returned, right? Well even If I tried, none would feel like it. What is the point to live a life if you fall down through an open manhole at a young age and realize you could be stuck there forever?

Even typing these things feels like I only have negative energy. I am a self-doubtful person and whenever they say it will be better, it will not be better if I can't make any of my own progress. I don't want to end up in a unhealthy relationship by stealing the positive energy from my girlfriend until I have finally achieved my desire. I crave for positive energy which is very hard to obtain these days.

I cannot do suicide because I fear of dying. No matter how much this would make me because I will never do it even if I am depressed. I was simply made to suffer an eternity in this purgatory that I was born to. Whoever even dares tell me that the teenage years are the happy years does not understand that life is unbalanced and cannot revolve around one person.

Let me tell you also this. At the end of my school year, the school psychologist promised me to find someone I could truly hang out with from one of my classmates and guess what? She never did! She backstabbed me with ""happy propaganda"" just to give me false hope and make me even more miserable. I want to treat people with kindness and virtue, not to be turned down and sent to the bottom of the ""bottomless pit"". Never will I ever be able to get out of it and live a happy ever after life like the others would do. I appreciate their every move and I don't feel like being jealous about it, I just wanted to be with them, not be away from them.

I don't believe in my own happiness, the happiness itself in general, the confidence to get a girlfriend, the relapsing that will change someone for good, the desire to talk to others because you will vanish quickly. Goodbye!

I don’t want to be this way,"i’m tired of being tired. I’m tired of laying in bed all day, every day, and being embarrassed thinking about how disgusted those close to me would be if they knew how I spent my day.

i’ve been in bed for 16 days straight. I don’t have energy, I’m on two different antidepressants and I’ve already explored antipsychotics. I’m using every remedy possible to try to numb the pain but I don’t think it’s working anymore.

i’ve never felt so alone. I feel like such a loser, like I’ve wasted my life.

Making Music is killing me,"Is Music the right path for me?

I‘m going insane. 

It‘s been several days just being in bed, playing videogames and just having no pace in chasing anything. I‘ve been there a couple of times. Since I started taking music seriously.

These days pass by but I‘m still not sure if I‘m ignoring the fact that this just ain‘t it.

I‘m turning 25 in one month and all I did the past years was trying to get better and chase a career in music. I developed a really good skill and bought all the stuff I need. I started releasing beginning of this year and it‘s slowly but surely growing. But I‘m still nowhere with around 1k monthly listeners. I also wouldn‘t say I‘m very talented in this - It‘s hard work for me but the outcome is good. I‘m working a Job on the side and spend all the money on professional production.

I have friends that are making good money off music and they are already really famous so I do have some insights into the industry and all the famous musician.

I often have the feeling that I‘m wasting my time, that I‘m not made for this and that I‘m smart enough to chase serious entrepreneurship that actually rewards you with money and freedom. Don‘t get me wrong, I didn‘t start this for money nor I‘m doing it for but I‘m just so scared of working myself into something I maybe wouldn‘t enjoy or even fail cause I can’t enjoy the process in it. I’m always stuck with me thinking where this goes and that theres almost no chance to live off this shit. Fame and just too less of money to sattle down. I can‘t tell myself it‘s just a hobby and you gotta love it - I do but I‘m also very hungry for a good life and income. And If I go for something I go for it all.

Maybe I already decided for myself that its time to give it up but its not easy to tell yourself that all this work you put in was for nothing.

There are days where I‘m the complete opposite and I wanna chase it with all my power. But most of the time it lets me questioning all of it.",OkraProper5679,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf4iqe/making_music_is_killing_me/
I think I have social anxiety but idk. Help/advice needed,"Imma start off by saying idk what I'm feeling exactly. I haven't really thought about it too much or talked to many people about my anxiety, I just felt like I needed to start here.

I feel like I have terrible social anxiety and its only gotten worse over the past year. I am an Asian kid 20yr/ol and I went to the US for college last year. I feel like my anxiety had been dormant while I was at home and going to a different country/culture made it come to light. Idk when I think about it I've never really been good in social situations, esp with my friends. I would like to believe that I'm fine with my family and people older than me, but it's bad when it's people my age. After going to the united states idk what triggered such bad anxiety within me but I can definitely tell that it's gotten worse and more frequent. For the most part, I am alright while interacting with my friends. Small talks don't bother me as such but I can't keep up with long, deep, meaningful, personal conversation that helps build relationships. My anxiety doesn't kick in every time I talk to people, but when it does idk what triggers it and it goes south real fast. I don't think I have that big of a social battery either, and when anxiety kicks in on top of that I just become fearful and paranoid (kinda, idk its hard to describe, like I don't want to exist). This has not happened to me often, in fact it has happened exactly twice, but when my anxiety is at its worst I cannot even order food. Like a task as simple as that feels like the most difficult thing you'll ever do. I started sweating and worrying and my head felt heavy like sth was weighing it down. I become so fearful of judgment. And now that I'm back home, my anxiety has stuck with me. I still feel terrible in social situations from time to time. Going to hang out with friends still feels like the worst decision I could make.

I still try to push myself to interact with people despite all of this. I believe underneath all of this I can carry a decent conversation with people. But for now, the anxiety is there, and it's real. All of this is especially tricky because I feel like if I don't go out I miss out on things. So it's like a lose-lose situation for me.",Conscious_Nothing_95,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf0jxs/i_think_i_have_social_anxiety_but_idk_helpadvice/
The thing that frustrates me the most about Major Depressive Disorder.,"It’s not the same as being depressed. I’m not saying it’s worse or anything like that. Everyone has their own opinions and feelings about their own and other’s depression. I speak for myself when I say this. It’s not the same as being depressed. Every time I’m depressed, I’m always hit with “what’s wrong” or “what happened”. Nothing fucking happened. I have a mental illness. No matter what happens, I’m going to be sad and tired. I could have the best day ever, and it doesn’t guarantee that I’ll be happy in the slightest. I could win the lottery. Find my soulmate. Become the absolute best person to ever live. Major Depressive Disorder doesn’t give a single fuck about any of that. It doesn’t care if I exercise. It doesn’t care if I get some fresh air. It definitely doesn’t give a fuck if I drank water today. Nothing matters. No matter what, I’m going to be depressed. It’s an illness, a disease. Someone with a chronic illness doesn’t get asked “have you tried journaling” as a treatment. It’s there to stay whether we like it or not. It’s the way life goes. It’s not fair in the slightest. I’m just so sick of my family asking me what I have to be sad about. Or my friends trying to cheer me up. If there was anything that could be done to help, I would’ve already fucking did it you fucking moron. I’m not just sitting on my ass waiting for my depression to up and peace out without a problem. It’s like it’s tattooed to my brain. Even drugs and alcohol don’t help. I can be half a bottle of vodka, 8 blunts, a few dabs, a bottle of pills, or some shrooms in and the only thing I can think of is how depressed I am. I can be in the middle of a huge party or an event and still dissociate and think about how sad I am. It’s absolutely unavoidable. I’ve been to therapy. I’ve been to psychiatrist. I’ve tried multiple anti-depressants and mood stabilizers. I’ve been inpatient 5 times. And I can say that I’ve made no progress. Actually, I’m worse off knowing that nothing has helped me. I’ve become more hopeless. More sad. It’s just terrible. Thoughts of suicide have become my only comfort. Knowing that I don’t have to live an entire life of not being able to enjoy anything is nice. I’ve tried self harm. Tried having friends. Having a girlfriend that I truly loved. None of those worked either. Now I’m here typing a post for Reddit at 4am. It feels like everyday im just getting closer to my suicide. It hurts so much.",toobrokentolove,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wf0cr3/the_thing_that_frustrates_me_the_most_about_major/

I used to have so many friends and they have all abandoned me.

I come from a good family who loved me but
now I only have my mom that I feel comfortable with. I hate my dad right now and I never talk to my sister and none of my friends care about me anymore. A part of me Feels guilty, but now that I’ve pushed everyone away I feel less guilty that there is only person I care about that will go through the pain of my suicide; my mother. I'm so angry. I'm so sad. I literally either am screaming because I’m so angry or screaming because I can’t control my crying and pain. I've tried everything; ketamine treatment, therapists, regular tms, expensive pointless abuse rehabs, jail, hospitals, etc! My parents are even planning on sending me to LA for a $25,000 new tms treatment at Stanford that I know will not work

and have gotten so close. I can't stop screaming about how much I hate so many people including
myself. My best friends blocked and deleted me off everything and I did nothing to them. I’ve never been so far at rock bottom. I'm so miserable. I don't want to fail at suicide again because I'm so sick of going to hospitals and treatment centers. I don't know what to do. IM SO ANGRY AT THE WORLD.

We struggle with money, my friends don't seem to care about me, my mother does sort of get mad too easily and says hurtful things sometimes, and my great grandfather died when I was younger and he was my main source of happiness. Those are the main things I get upset about. And I am aware that there are people who have it way worse than me, some people have been abused, some people weren't loved properly by their parents, people have experienced all kinds of stuff. My reasons to be upset feel really small and unimportant, which also makes me feel even more depressed.

I'm not excited about love anymore and it's kinda depressing,"Currently in a depressive slump and this is one of the things that makes me feel a little less excited for the future. 

I've always been a hopeless romantic and when I was younger, I spent so much time being excited and giddy at the thought at falling in love. But as I age and experience more bad things with men, I realise that romantic love is very scarce in supply (at least for me). Honestly, what I miss most is how hopeful I was. Now I think about love and I feel nothing except a little sadness at how my romanticised idea of romantic love is lost. 

The issue isn't fully with men tbh; it's me. I used to make up fake scenarios of me falling in love and I'd feel excited. Now I just feel very doubtful. I feel kinda nauseous when I think about falling in love. I don't know if I have the ability to love romantically 🥲 

Honestly, if God has decided that romantic love isn't in my future then so be it. I just miss the hope I used to have. I always thought that my life would take a ""fall in love young and get married and start a family early"" route but I don't think I can stomach that for my future. Now I'm not sure what I want. I guess it's a little exciting because there's tons to explore so that I can decide on what I want.

I've been to therapy, I take pills from a psychiatrist like a drug addict and nothing helps. There is only pain and fear everywhere. Depression and anxiety. I have destroyed my whole life, I can't even take care of the simplest things. I have broken teeth, a postural defect, I'm obese and suffer every day. No one can help me, nothing ever works. I've worked maybe one year in the last 10 years and only as a security guard. I am not fit for anything else, I have no education, no friends, no support, nothing.

Now im stuck at the house all alone while all my friends progressed through their lives. 

İ used to like drawing and writing but now i just stare at the blank page infront of me, infact that blank page made wanna write this 1 minute ago.

My buddy and i were really in to drawing and exchanged difrent techniques frequently but in the end hes been the one that progressed while i become the one that droped. İ feel happy for him but, i dont know we went the road together but when we split it ended for me. İ drew thing since i was child but this time was a very long drop and it is burning me inside.

İt is same for writing too. İ cant write anymore, my thoughts cant turn to words anymore and even if they do i cant write them.

And now Aİs sarted to pop up just to draw things, and i feel more ineficent then ever. İ need to get resdy for next university exam this year while my friends leaving this hell  hole of a country.
İ know my future in 10 month will be thr same cycle which is stucking at home and repesting the same day, and im afraid to repeat playing computer and laying down while being useless.

İ dont even know why i wrote these here, maybe i needed someone to tell or maybe i just wanted to get some attention with my miserable state.",That_birey,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weqaf5/i_feel_ineficent_and_worthless_than_ever/
Run and Just Hide,"So I’m(26F) a single mother of two wonderful kids and I have full custody of them. I’m writing this because I’m emotionally and physically drained. My kids are with me most of the time because there dad chooses to only get them on his weekends no more. It’s fine because I don’t like to push my kids off on anyone even if it is his responsibility but they have me so I guess that’s all they need. They also go to there grandma and aunts sometimes but most of the time they are with me and I’m not complaining. Its just lately my anxiety and depression is really weighing me down. I really just want to run and hide. Not die but hide.Like in a deep dark place for like a week or so and sleep my pain and worries away. Just so I can feel nothing and not think and just sleep it all away.

This really makes me sad writing this knowing my kids would probably go crazy not hearing my voice or seeing my face. Im literally all they know on a huge level of comfort. They are really attached to me and it would hurt my soul to leave them like that. And I’m also attached to the also the longest They’ve ever been away from is a week or a week in a half but they made sure they called me. They are all I have and they make me really happy. Sometimes depression gets the best of me and I really feel like shutting down. Just hide and sleep.

Help. Please.,"I don’t want to do anything. I just lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling. I feel very different.

Too depressed to get out of depression,"Getting out of depression needs work which I am unable to put effort into. I am seeing a company provided therapist,  all she does is to praise me for my good efforts which I think are normal (like you know, not doing a reply-all when I am upset with a colleague). I am too poor to afford a therapist myself.

I want to switch therapist but I also feel bad about it and I wonder if my company will notice me switching. I dislike journaling in a ""single source"" because of privacy reasons - there are so many online backdoors nowadays and offline options are not good enough as I don't live alone, I am scared others will read my journal. At least if this one got read by someone I know irl, it is just one page. One entry.

I used to have a good psychologist, but she was too expensive and felt I progressed enough to not need her help. I learn from her that I can't be depressed for no reason - which is true. I just didn't want to admit the source. Today, I am depressed because I made a mistake at work. I may look like I don't care about work on the surface but the truth is I take failings personally, so personally I feel numb and helpless about it. I need some some guidance for this. I feel that there's something wrong with me psychologically to feel defeated by a mistake, which was in good faith. I am also thinking about the past mistakes I think and how it is gonna repeat again... Because I didn't want to put in the effort to change.

Another thing that bothered me is my new psychiatrist. I was supposed to have an appointment with him a few days ago. It was pushed back by a month...And before that I called him asking him for help to top up my insomnia medications but I hasn't been sleeping well and I am suffering from a loss of appetite. He didn't get back to me on meeting me ad-hoc. He is a very busy busy doctor I guess. At least my last psychiatrist will squeeze out time for me, staying back a little later so he could see me for 10 minutes when I told him the medication isn't working for me and I want to change back to my old meds. 

All this little tiny disasters in my life has sap me of my motivation, my energy, my appetite (I often skip meals or eat very little) and I don't even know what to do now. My depression will kill my career and academic prospects. But I don't know if I can even help myself anymore. I am passively suicide - thinking about ending it whenever a tiny disaster came.

The fact that my psychiatrist appointment was pushed back by a month bother me. I am trying my best not to take it personally but I can't. I needed help for my insomnia, I asked for it, I had a talk with him, but no help came. My therapist isn't helpful either.

I came to Reddit because I don’t have any friends,"I want to know that I’m not the only one feeling this way. I don’t have and have never had any real friends. Idk what’s wrong with me. As a child I was painfully shy, I would only talk to my immediate family and be completely mute in public, especially school. Because of that, I don’t have any childhood friends. Throughout my twenties, and even now, I would find one or two friends but then within a couple years it completely fizzes out. If I don’t reach out then I will never hear from them. Three times I got lucky and thought I found my “friend soulmates” and it felt like meaningful connections but then even those fizzled out. They always start to make me feel like I’m bothering them, and again, if I don’t reach out then I’ll never hear from them. Every time I meet new women they always say how much they love me and they’ll always want to be around me. They’ll even start copying the way I talk, dress, music, hobbies and then all of a sudden I stop hearing from them. Or they start “accidentally” leaving me out. A couple weeks ago I was supposed to go to an event with my friend that I told her about three months ago. Instead she invited her other friends to go and ghosted me at the event. I spent the whole night alone and couldn’t stop sobbing once it was over and I was outside waiting for my Uber. 

I am so lonely. I have absolutely no one I can reach out to. When I go back home to visit, my parents act like I’m an inconvenience. The only notifications I’ve gotten on my phone in the last three weeks are from DoorDash. My existence doesn’t matter. I’ve been in therapy and done all this “healing” but I still cry myself to sleep every night because I’ve always felt so alone in this world. I have no one. I’ve been able to manifest a seemingly good life and everything I’ve wanted except for a real human connection. I’m not sure what to do. I’ve never felt like I fit in anywhere. I’m always too “weird” for other people but I’m only being myself. The things I’m interested in, I can’t find anyone else who is interested. So I’m just alone. All of the time. I do everything alone and these days I cry at every damn thing even in public. Alone at brunch I’ll start crying because I see a group of girlfriends and that’s something I’ve always wanted. I go on vacations by myself and will see friend groups and couples enjoying themselves and I’ll just start crying. It’s like I can no longer fight back the tears. 

Usually journaling, yoga and music help keep my spirits up, but since my “friend” ghosted me at that event I just haven’t stopped crying. Everyone can see the sadness on face now and I used to be so good at hiding it. Even on my good days there’s always a piece of me that just wants to die. There’s this pain that doesn’t go away. I can’t feel anything in my heart except pain. As much as I try to spread love, I have no idea what love feels like. Everyone is always saying how things will get better but it’s been decades and nothing has changed. Every night I go to sleep I wish that I won’t wake up and when I see the next morning I am disappointed. Now I’m back to the point where I don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to eat or clean or play video games or dance, nothing. If I’m not at work then I’m either laying on my couch, bed or floor watching YouTube until I fall asleep. I really don’t know why I’m here. Maybe I just came for human interaction.",munebeem,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weuqod/i_came_to_reddit_because_i_dont_have_any_friends/

And I even consider just going out with her as a friend because that's what I need and I genuinely don't think I can just the thought of hanging out with her at a pool or going on a walk or some shit makes me so sad because I feel like she would rather be there with anyone else and not just her any of my friends

Since 10 years depression,"I noticed the other day that I have been depressed for at least 10 years now. Maybe even longer, but it really started in 2012. At that time I was sitting in the psychiatric ward after a suicide attempt, where I was diagnosed for the first time.

Today, 10 years later, I am basically not one step further, quite the opposite. I am psychologically and partly physically a wreck. All the antidepressants and other experiments to cure my depression have ultimately done me more harm than good (post SSRI sexual dysfunction/medication induced anhedonia).

Now I sit brain-damaged in a small apartment with no education and life from the social welfare office. The best time of life (I'm in my late 20's) passes me by while (ex)friends have their dream jobs, move into their houses, get married, have their first children... Nothing will ever give me back that time.

I wouldn't even say that antidepressants but depression ruined my life, because it ultimately led me to them. Anyone who has a real depression knows that it is hell in itself. If I had this known then, I would have given up earlier. Life is besides hard work also a lot of luck.

Bad luck hate my life,"All started the bad waves of “3’s” 

I got my dog about 9 weeks ago and it started there. 

- I got ryker, he swallowed his collar on his journey from Canada to Montana. 

- second week he got iron poisoning from a cuddle toy and the owner was a bitch and didn’t care that he had so much iron in his body it looked like a Christmas tree.

- fourth week with him, was the day I got my surgery and it was suppose to be 20 min surgery and 2 days of healing in my knee. Turned out to be 3 hours long, and 6 weeks on crutches / boot.

- a day after surgery, I let him off leash in our own area, my neighbor dog mauled him ripped half his tongue in half. Now he has a crooked tongue, and $2500 later. The other dog owner she is a cunt and so is her stupid fucking dog.

- I then am taking longer to do shit because no one could help me put on pants, dress myself, or bathe myself. Work got upset despite me needing the surgery.

- I then worked for two years with said company, to renege on their promise to me 2 years ago if I took a shitty paying job, I would get more money. They ended up hiring 4 other people and for the job I was promised, they rehired a guy that went through 11 employees during his 3 years, then walked off the job. During that time he had a chick write “rapist” in his truck which I guess he thought was hilarious. He then shot a guy at his house in the chest and that’s who they hired over me

- I complained and made it very apparent as that was a horrible move. 

- I was brought in a meeting as I knew they were trying to get rid of me. I documented all of it including recording it. Now I
May have a wrongful discharge lawsuit.


- a guy I was suppose to meet canceled on me and said his mom died the exact same time we were suppose to meet.

- I bought a brand new car and if I knew I would have just been losing it a month after I feet it things would be different.

-now I have no income. No job.

- none of crew has messaged me to
See if anything is okay.

- a guy I liked literally over the past four days has went between one extreme another between extreme devaluation and praise. He blew me off again tonight.

Could I possibly have some advice?,"So I've been severely burnt out from university due to poorly-supported adhd, anxiety and depression making it so i never completed enough work to take breaks more than once a month. Also partially due to ingrained guilt at not being productive enough 24/7.

I've been off school for 3 months now and spend the days trying to be productive or enjoy myself but end up failing to do either (causing guilt). Days mostly consist of being too tired (worsened by meds) and uninterested to do much besides lay facedown in bed from 8am to 1am waiting until it's time to sleep. This includes interests like games or writing, and self-care like eating or showering which have to be forced after hours of trying to get up.

And because of parents, i have to recover from the burnout ASAP so i can get a job/return to school. This created a sort of Ticking Bomb time limit to recover from the depression enough to be productive and make use of the time off.

I considered just forcing myself to get a job, maybe one that causes minimal stress/social anxiety, but im unsure if that's condusive to relaxing enough to recover from burnout.

Any advice?

Surviving but not living.,"This post may be a ramble- sorry I’m advance. 

I am 19 years old, and I’ve been dealing with mental illness since I was 11. Since then, I’ve been in cpep countless times, psych wards, residential facilities. After the last long term stay (when I was 16), I thought I was getting better. I’ve attempted twice since then, just hospital stays. 
I’ve been in therapy for so long, every 2 weeks. Therapy helped me a lot through everything. However, my adolescent therapist had to discharge me from her services August 2021, as I was getting too old. Since then, I’ve been trying to find an adult therapist. It’s either not accepting patients or super long waitlists and never getting a call. With my psychiatrist, she’s a whole story in herself. 
Due to past situations, I have a really hard time trusting anyone, therapists, doctors, etc. I’ve only trusted one psychiatrist in my entire life, but he was a fellow and got moved somewhere else. The one I currently have, I despise. 
As I am on my mother’s insurance, she sees who I see. So, she always finds a way to get ahold of her. My psychiatrist never believes a word I tell her. Only believes my mom, even though I never gave her consent to speak with her. I don’t even live with my mother. 
I have told my psychiatrist countless times about how I’d like to switch my medication, as it makes me feel NO EMOTION at all. I feel like a zombie on this medication, and all she does is add more to the pile I already take. She never changes the one I ask her to change. 
I took it into my own hands and ended up stopping my medication all together. I have felt better and it’s been a lot trying to manage emotions and actually feeling something, it’s been a lot. However, she never believes a word I say.
Example: I tell her I’ve been feeling better without the medication. She always asks “are you manic” when I even sound remotely happy. It makes me feel so… I don’t even know what word to use. It just feels awful. 
It feels awful how every time I am actually happy, nobody cares, nobody supports me, and everyone ALWAYS thinks I’m “manic” and “impulsive”. My mom acts as if she is some advocate for mental health awareness yet treats me like trash, and my dad caused so much trauma to me in the past. Not even the support that is supposed to be for ME believes a word I say, because my mom who doesn’t live with me told her otherwise. I feel like I’m just falling again just dealing with t all. It feels like it never ends. 
I would get a new psychiatrist, however I’ve called almost every place remotely close to my area and they all aren’t accepting new patients OR have a waitlist. 

I just feel like I’m not living, just surviving. It sucks, I thought I’d be thriving at this point… however the never ending crap is always there. Ugh.

i'm a 17 year old trans guy with severe depression,"As the title says i am trans and i will go back to that after i give some context to why i'm even posting here.
I have been struggling with depression since i was 13 and at the same time realized i was trans but denied it because i wasn't ready to deal with that.
For all those years since it started i've had very bad episodes of being depressed for months, sometimes i get better for no reason then go back to wanting to kill myself.

I started medication when i was 15 or 16 and have had that medication up until a few days ago, i have been going through the process of changing my mecidatiom and now i'm off meds and i'm pretty sure all of you know that's a slow process.

Today i start in a new school and have to move to a dorm because the school is in a different city, i'm already stressef because firstly i don't have any strenght or motivation to study and now comes the part about me being trans.
I came out to my mom, stepdad and sibling when i was 15 and my dad and stepmom when i was 16 but i haven't told an irl friend i will be going to the sale school with and i don't want to.
But if i don't tell her and explain why i want to be called something else then my deadname i will have to be deadnamed and misgendered by the teachers and that friend for the next 2-3 years, if anyone here is trans i'm sure they know that doesn't feel nice to be closeted just bc you're scared or don't have the strength to deal with the possible outcomes of peoples reactions and so on.

I also have social anxiety and never really had friends irl, atleast not ones that stayed or even cared about me, since i've struggled with that i can't risk losing an only irl friend by coming out.
I don't want to be alone at school anymore, been bullied since i was 7 up until i was 15 so i don't want any more of that or having to sit alone or eat alone.
Last school i was at i had some sort of friends but not those kinda people that i would come out to or even talk to after school and i didn't.
I am extremly depressed right now, i have been through so much shit and rn while being on the damn edge and trying not to end my life i don't have the strenght for any of this.
I rather just pass away, i don't want anyone to worry as i'm not planning anything but i really need some support.",jokiisdumb,51,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/we3j5z/im_a_17_year_old_trans_guy_with_severe_depression/

Nothing,do you ever completely numb. do you ever feel like everything is completely pointless. like even if you were “happy” it would ultimately mean nothing because literally nothing matters and nothing is real. nothing is real everything has been created and you can’t trust your thoughts or feelings or anything because nothing is real. sometimes cutting myself if the only real thing I can trust. the blood and pain is the only thing that I can trust to prove I am still here,Agreeable_Cup7975,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wezmw2/nothing/
Scared my life is going to go nowhere.,"I'm 26 and I'll be 27 in just over a month. I dropped out of university when I was about 20 because the course I was on was a complete scam (online assignment papers simply linking to YouTube videos). When I left I had the goal of getting an apprenticeship instead while I worked, I worked at a call centre, McDonald's and various factories and tried for about 4 or 5 different apprenticeships over 3 or 4 years as I worked, sometimes I got pretty far but othertimes I was turned away almost immediately, one for example I got rejected because I ""didn't write enough"" on my application even though I filled all of the boxes, when it came to the next year and I went to apply again the applications were only available to people who were fresh out of school despite the fact I had a level 3 diploma from college in the field I was applying for. So I was considered overqualified, which is ridiculous.

When I hit 24 I realised it was going nowhere and I hated working the awful jobs that I was working in the meantime, so I decided to go back to university but this time I figured I'd take a different path and learn a new skill, that being programming in c++, although we actually code in c# most of the time. Now I'm on my final year and the chances of me getting a job at the end seem very slim, so I'm working on my own project for myself in Unity hoping I can produce something that generates enough money that I can support myself. But I feel scared because if it doesn't work out, which it is very likely not to, and I don't get a job at the end, then I'm gonna be back in the same position I was 3 years ago.

It doesn't help that I have basically no reason to live, besides the lack of career and absolutely no financial success, I also have no girlfriend and my list of friends is very slim and they're at work all the time anyway since they're about my age and actually have their life together.",awwhjeez,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wezjyd/scared_my_life_is_going_to_go_nowhere/

I’m tired of fighting but somehow I find strength to keep pushing through the days. Why can’t I be happy? My life isn’t bad I would say but mentally, I just destroy myself every day. I always find flaws within my self and never feel I’m good enough. I don’t find myself attractive nor do I think anyone does. It feels like I have no self love for myself and it’s a hurtful feeling to have thinking you aren’t good enough and will never be good enough for anyone.

My plugs the only one to tell me they love me,"https://youtu.be/gNxKRP_KErU

I am 33, project manager and senior estimator obviously have tied my identity to my occupation. Although thinking about a lifetime doing what I’m doing fills me with dread and unease. I am self diagnosed borderline personality disorder. Although it can be argued that these undesirable qualities are exacerbated by physical opiate dependency and a rationalized dependence on methamphetamines to counter the sedative of nature of roxys and fentanyl, in order to keep up with work. I’ve been somewhat of a disagreeable person unable or unwilling to fit in as long as I can remember. Even though I had always found a tight knit group of compatible  personalities. It wasn’t until I was older that I recognize this disagreeable nature was my resistance and opposition of the status quo. As I am I do not hesitate to voice my disagreement In situations that I’ve believe to be wrong. Maybe some would argue that my willingness to speak up and out is a good quality to have. And this is not true. already being oddball black sheep, expressing opposition has only allowed me to push away from people or make it easy for people to drift away from me. But it’s more than that I have been selfish and living hedonistically since I could make decisions for myself.  In middle school I was a different level of self involved and inconsiderate. But after that tumultuous confusing age I have been hyper aware in sensing and perceiving the feelings of those around me. Made every effort to always to be considerate and respectful of another person‘s heart, no games no leading on. It’s still true to this day, though I have bore a fair share of unhealed licks to my heart. I never dated just take ones time and space, taking commitments like that seriously, getting into an exclusive, meant I was willing to take a shot for the long-haul. Because I am choosy I was single and mingling or faithfully committed. But I am The offspring of two narcissists who married because of pregnancy. I found out this year that my Aunt has always adored and been proud of my siblings and I. Saying we were planted in hostile soil and chaotic storm but managed to grow through Becoming beautiful flowers. Obviously you can see she did not get along with her sister, my mother.  Parents went through a &gt;10 year divorce settlement process. My mom always thought my dad‘s just dripping in hidden wealth. But after years of investigatory auditors, you’d imagine they’d have found it.  They still go back to court to make sure her alimony is maxed out. This is relevant because he doesn’t work anymore. Comes in to sign payroll check, otherwise traveling or golfing. I have a book keeper who does payroll offline and payables. All project management, bidding/estimating, business development, billing/AR &amp; CRM is on me. My salary is what I made as an entry level project engineer when I worked for a GC. My raise requests to my boss/dad have all been rejected or ignored rather.  We’re profitable across the board on all projects. And since I returned 2018 after working for a hotel building GC, I have seen his monthly payouts go from 7k to now between 20k-40k. Half my mom takes. But it doesn’t matter how aggressively I commit to growth and profit, I see none of it. And what ever growth there is, mom is ready to receive. I can’t make any real changes in the office. The book keeper is basically extorting her job security from my dad for the numerous occasions of documented toxic and abusive management he’s put her through. So she can say she’s not going to use QuickBooks or anything that can be digestible for those who’d replace her. My dad hasn’t really spoken to me for about a year now because I have called him out for the toxic passive aggressive guilt tripping or furious outbursts. My brother is beholden to him and has basically cast me out as deplorable. My sister was someone i could always confide in. But I recently fucked that up. She got hired at a much larger company in industry and pretty much started talking down at me telling me I’m lazy for not getting a different job. She’s got maybe 2 years exp. In industry and it sounds like our family name and personable impression got her the job from how she described the interview. I got so upset and the rapid shift to better than thou that I pointed out to her what I’m saying here, minimizing her abilities. Sometimes I feel like I’m not in the driver seat when I get mad like that and say things I don’t  believe, mean or that I regret saying. Like I just watch it happen shaking my head like, you fucking asshole moron what’s wrong with you. I get invitations to discuss offers at least once a week usually over doubling my current salary. But we’ve got installation crews in total 25 guys right now. Some guys have worked for this company since I was a baby. If I left everything would fall apart and these people with family’s who’ve spent decades working for this company, then what. I don’t know I have it in me to bear abandoning them like that. A lot of a steadily stacking these layers of complications and shit have brought me to the conclusion that if I killed my self I would solve all my problems and would not have to bear the guilt of leaving the company like that. I can’t take a break or even detox because if I let my foot off the gas our quality goes down and trust faulters with clients. I don’t drive with my seat belt on any more and started adding fentanyl and Xanax to my coping mechanisms (not both with driving with other people on road) just maybe fall asleep and never wake up. I’ve pushed everyone away. Any friends I had still moved out of state during COVID. If i died no one would know until the money needed to come in. Yet I go through the morbid through experiment of what would be said at my funeral and I can see private hushed side conversations of “what took him so long”. Whatever generic de-escalation catchphrase you’d want to think of that might convince me otherwise, just realize if my family won’t even talk to me and I’m not worth being a friend, if my memories are mine alone and not shared with anyone what really is the point in being alive in my own created personal hell anymore",QuantizeCrystallize,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weye8b/my_plugs_the_only_one_to_tell_me_they_love_me/

I'm losing my battle with depression.,"Good morning. 

Thanks for dropping in and giving this a read. I guess what I would like to open with is the quote 

""this moment will pass"" 

This quote popped up when I googled the title of my post. This quote is supposed to demonstrate the impermenance of the human condition and how things can change.

My particular set of pain arises from the fact that I strongly believe my moment has passed. The opportunities I had for the happiness I desired in this world passed me by. Or I actively destroyed them. 

due to my personal background my attachment styles are so fucked. I have zero friends in the town I grew up in (and which I am currently living). I was unable to be a good person to my partner of 9 years, and drove them away. Ultimately in them they provided the small amount of comfort I could get from other people. 

I cut off the only ""caregivers"" I had growing up. My mother and my grandfather as without going into detail lay the ground work for anxious avoidant and people pleasing attachment style. These people did things that show a child you don't love them. These people were not caregivers. Their patterns of behavior toward me were repeated in the friendships and romantic relationships I had throughout my teens and most of my 20s. 2 events from my childhood fill me with such terror I literally can't talk about them directly to protect myself. Coming to terms with that has been a dark driver for me. 

Leaving my ex is what drove me to therapy and led me to a lot of self discovery. And hence why I am here today. My mind is prone to terrible patterns of fear, pain, and rumination. This pattern would occur even in the ""good times"" (stable life with my partner and no critical eye toward the past). Things are only becoming more lonely, dark, and hopless. My point of view on where I am in life is quite low. I don't like or respect myself at all. For example because my ex told me I was overweight I began to eat under a thousand calories a day as a way to gain control over myself. Like I don't deserve to eat normally due to how unruly and lowly I have been in the past with my eating. And this pattern continues throughout my life at work, school, and with family.

what I've done so far to try and get better: 

-moved in with family to reduce financial and personal stress due to being alone 
-regular exercise
-regular outings with family
-nearly weekly expensive therapy sessions
- reading:how to fix a broken heart by guy winch. Self-compassion Kirsten neff. At last a life, the alchemist, how to change your mind, thinking far slow.
-weightloss dieting to look better
-creation of many dating profiles and chatting regularly with women via Snapchat 
-allowing myself to express repressed emotion by putting sad music on in my car and sobbing everytime I drive to and from work
-the use of recreational drugs after a nearly 5-8 year hiatus to try and feel something other than sadness 
- reaching out to as many old friends as possible
- going out on my own if I am unable to find ppl to go out with.

so this is where I get to brass tax. I want to live. I want to live the life I think I could have had if I had did things differently five years ago. I want to be a happy person who could show love and respect to someone I think of as my soulmate. The person I am is not that kind sweet man I remember being at 19.  I don't like this person I've become.

I thought I would lose this battle today but it seems that scheduling self murder can be interrupted by family. If I were to put numbers on it I think I have a 25% chance of suicide within the next 18 months. In my mind I'm suffering in a irreparable state and therefore do not need to continue. My plan is to get a carbon monoxide detector, run a hose from my tailpipe to the car and when the thing says I'm at murder concentrations go take a nap. I know the approximate location I would do it at and am working on a few journals for the express purpose of leaving. I know the people I would call and what details I would give to them before I ditched my phone and left cell service.

I want to live. I want to be happy again. Please reader if you have made it this far can you just say you see that I'm in pain and show me some empathy. If you want to take it to another level tell me if there is something you think I should do or do differently. I don't want to die. Well I do. But I want to be happy. You know what I am saying.

just a rant,"By no means am I looking for help, I just feel like I'm not being heard. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be heard. 
We all do stupid shit, we all do bad shit. I haven't done the worst of things so why do I treat myself like I do? 
We all want to be successful, regardless of what you say, we just have different definitions of success. But how do you find success when you have no ambitions, no skills, no social circles? You don't, you get acquainted with boredom, loneliness, and failure. But if this is all there is to my life then why live? 
Why try new hobbies, knowing I am going to get bored of it and stop caring about growth and progression? 
They are all just distractions from the vast emptiness that is my mind. A mind that is only ever otherwise filled with self hatred and anguish. 
If we fulfill our own purpose then how do I find a purpose when I end up hating everything and everyone I've ever come into contact with?

I am scared, because the pain is so much. I live in poor living conditions..my health is deteriorating.

My boyfriend is absent for most of the time. Last night I was in tremendous amount of pain to the point I wanted to end my life. I kept calling him, but he never responded. I sobbed and cried for hours, wrote a final goodbye note then just fell asleep out of exhaustion. Now it is just a matter of acting on it. I dont want to die..but I dont see a way out anymore.

All my hopes and dreams have been shattered. I just feel so alone. No one is in my corner. Noone is there to help me through. My friends are either tired of me or I have pushed them away. I keep myself busy with work so I don't think too much. My medication doesn't seem to be working anymore.

All I wanted in life was to be loved and cherished. To be accepted for who I am but I guess I got the short end of the stick. I even fear now maybe my bf is cheating on me. Why wouldn't he? I am noone special and I have nothing of value to offer. Its sad..I have never been hugged, I don't know how it is like to experience the warmth of sleeping next to someone you love.

A dark paradise.,"I don’t know how to start this. It’s my first post so don’t judge me. 

I’ve been going through depression for the past 10 years. Over these years it comes in waves as if you were stranded in an ocean on a broken life raft and without any warning a wave swallows you whole. After going through what I have I hold all the pain and sorrow. I blame myself for how I feel and I can’t help but feel like I’m unloved by my own family. Imagine sitting in a room with your parents feeling like an outsider to your own blood. The darkness surrounds me like a coffin and I see no way out. I know people say there is always a light at the end of the tunnel but I’ve been walking this path for 10 years and haven’t seen a glimpse of light. I’ve built up my walls like an impenetrable castle. I have a girlfriend right now but I can’t show her the love she deserves, and I’m too scared to let her go because I don’t think there is anyone out there that can deal with me. I try to live life, I go to the beach (my happy place) but it reminds me of all my pain. I wear the mask a lot of us have. I smile, make people laugh and I help anyone I can but nobody cares to ask how am I doing. At the end of my day I become a recluse and hide away I’m my dark palace that has become my home. I don’t want to make this too long but if you read this thank you. Any help would be appreciated. This is the only place or time I’ve ever asked for help so again anything helps.",red_dawn7,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wewko1/a_dark_paradise/
Scared of antidepressants,"I'm seeing someone for my insomnia and he wants me on this antidepressant that also serves as a sleep aid (trazodone). I am very scared of it and don't want to take it, but I feel like I can't function or be happy with my sleep patterns as they are. As bad as my insomnia and depression are, it's still me inside, if that makes sense. I don't want to fuck with my brain, and I'd rather die as me than become some zombie on antidepressants or sleeping pills. I don't want to change my core self (which is also why I'd never take something like shrooms or acid). 

I'm also scared of the long-term effects of these drugs, as it seems like they've been poorly/insufficiently studied over the years. I hate the idea of using my brain as a lab for different drugs to ""keep trying until we find something that works"". I feel stuck, and I don't know what to do.

The sleep specialist knows that I don't want to take antidepressants, but I equivocated a bit when it came to sleep aids. Should I just say outright that I won't take them? Will he get mad at me for undermining a treatment plan? I feel very scared and alone.",aemon_the_dragonite,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wewgm9/scared_of_antidepressants/
I have to go into debt if I want treatment,"I'm 20 and live in the US. I've spent the last few years trying my hardest to get therapy and treatment but I've had no luck. 

I have a fair share of mental problems, but no diagnosis because I could never afford one. Whatever I have severely effects my ability to live a normal life because I can't keep a job. I've tried so hard to power through and hold out long enough to afford treatment, but I never can. I always crash at the two month mark. Because of this, I'm constantly moving around and have been homeless a few times because I can't afford to rent anywhere. 

I suspect I have depression, ADHD (or something that severely inhibits my executive function) and bpd. However, I don't want to self-diagnose so they are just speculations. 

I realized that in order to get help, I'm going to have to take out a personal loan and use it on therapy or maybe go into credit card debt, I really don't want to do this. Despite my living situations, I always tried to be financially responsible with the money I did have. I've never been into debt and I have a pretty good credit score. For so long, I tried to ignore my mental illnesses and live a normal life, but it's painfully obvious that I can't. I need help.

I really hate the system. Has anyone else done something like this? I'm scared of going into debt but if it really helps, then it'll be worth it.",throwaway_1329492,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weree0/i_have_to_go_into_debt_if_i_want_treatment/
FATIGUE AND APATHY,"Hi there, I have been struggling with depression for a long time (big big mommy issue/trauma) and my huge problem has always been tiredness. I mean, I kind of can handle - more or less - sadness, desperation, emptiness and loneliness, but fatigue and apathy literally ruined my life. When I was on psychoanalysis it went even worse, because my therapist basically stopped believing me and kept on telling me to react and go to work, making me feel even more frustrated, anxious and guilty.
I've tried many antidepressants with very little/no results. I really wish doctors could find a specific illness that makes me so tired and sleepy, I'm exhausted of being treated like a ""lazy"" woman who refuses to live her life, it's extremely painful and humiliating.

Strict and Dysfunctional Parents alongside Asbergers has given my depression,"My parents have always been insanely strict , and has affected me socially.

From pre school to sixth grade, I went to a small Christian school (only 8 students in my class) and I did not get along with anyone there. My parents constantly compared me negatively to my peers. I was always above intelligence but they made fun of me being socially awkward, even though bruh my whole life I only knew 7 other people.

Fast forward, went to public middle school, and thrived socially.First time in my life I made friends and actually had my first kiss and made it to third base in 8th grade and was drinking . My parents did not want me dating and was basically living a double life , of frat bro at school and church boy at home.

High school, I still had my friend group and made new friends. Because of my parents pushing Christian values, whatever the fuck that means, they didn't want me to date and even though I had friends that were girls and kissed and all that, I NEVER  brought them to my house and avoided getting too close with them. They also started drug testing me junior year and whenever I went which I did once in a blue moon, literally would follow me and smell my breath and I had to be home at 7 pm. I basically had friends only in school and not outside of school, bc after my sophomore year, I stopped going to see them.

All the sudden, college , my parents are like you should get married and find a good Christian girl.I go to a big public city school , I'm from suburban TX , and my freshman and sophomore year I did fine academically, but the 2 years of rare outside social contact , fucked me up and I had trouble keeping friends.

I fell in love with a girl right before COVID, who was not Christian, she was Hindu, and I told my parents. My parents were fine with here but worried about her ""moral values"",but my grandparents, were like ""you coudn't find a white girl?"" . She also really liked to make bracelets and my parents would lose their shit because bracelets on a man look ""gay"".

Over time, dealing with it ruined me mentally. We ended up breaking up but I wouldn't bring up dating ever again with my parents.

The stress that came from the relationship plus covid led me to gain weight and my grades slipped. I still passed but my cumGPA had dropped from a 3.2 to a 2.8 in one year.

Over the summer,I met a new girl who was East Asian and I obviously hid the relationship from my parents. She abused by punching and slapping me, stole from my credit card,and I could not tell my parents cuz they'd be  like ""thats what happens when you date someone who doesnt believe in Jesus&gt;""

I ended up failing all my classes that semester, and when my parents found out they took me out of school.

They took my phone and my laptop away and I ended up working at a Fed EX warehouse for 4 months. I hated it and my depression got worse, bc every day I would come home to my parents screaming abt how I fucked up my life, and how they can't show their faces at church, bc their kid dropped out of school. I also had no contact with anyone. They would also scream at me for sleeping for so long.

In June, I began taking summer online courses, but I'm still working 6 hours a day. I do not have a phone so I still can't contact anyone and especially in compsci, when I'm stuck I can't contact friends to help which is led to my grades suffering.  Over the past month, I have woken up and have headaches 24/7.

Since Christmas, I have not had any contact with any of my friends and I have begun to talk to myself and I could give a shit abt my appearance so I've gained even more weight. My parents blame me for "" being in outer space and acting weird"" but I have had ZERO SOCIAL CONTACT with anyone. They still scream at me every day.

Lastly , my parents are big ON CHURCH but they have been screaming at each other since I was 2.  I've dealt with hours of screaming matches daily my whole fuckin life, and it's led to me being scared of others and I'm unable to stand up for myself.

I want to know how to get better, and right now the biggest thing is the lack of social contact bc I've been going crazier every day.",Global-Comfort989,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weqall/strict_and_dysfunctional_parents_alongside/

"I just need support or a conversation. I'm 22 years old, she's 23. And now she says she wants to break up."," We've been together for over seven years, three of which have been married. It's been an amazing seven years that I always think back on with a smile. She is my first love, and divorce seemed impossible to me even a month ago. Everything seemed so magical. But now divorce is a reality she told me yesterday. On our wedding anniversary.

We were married a few years ago. We weren't in a toxic relationship at the time (although there was a time when that relationship was, in the beginning), we had matured, and then we started talking about starting a family. It seemed like the right thing to do. Our relationship was no different than a normal marriage and we just wanted to secure the result of our growing up.

It was a great relationship. It was always built on telling each other the truth and not holding back on problems. On solving crisis situations together. She was my best friend, my lover, and it always seemed so permanent. We may have disagreed on some things, but it was never a problem.

It's probably worth starting a little further back. In February of this year, I cracked up. My stepfather died last August from a coronavirus, and after that I had to combine work and study to help my mom with the loans my father had gotten me. My employer was crap. She could call me at 1 a.m. to do completely unnecessary tasks. The pay was crap too, but it was a living wage. At the same time I was in master's degree program.

She was at home with her parents, in our hometown, Rostov-on-Don. I was in Moscow. I was trying to save money to start renting a place to live together. At the same time she was studying for the degree she wanted. It was hard for me, but I felt I could rely on her if I had a tough time. I expected mutual acceptance.

She came when I could save up; and it was a few wonderful months in a new place, a new page in my life. We had our problems, but nothing beyond what the average couple goes through.

But here I cracked. I dropped out of university, quit my job, and started looking for a new one. While preparing for another interview - I realized that I was emotionally exhausted completely. I had an accurate understanding that I was failing at the university. But realizing that I was falling apart and that I looked like a veggie was harder. She left to visit our parents, and I took off after her to my hometown. I was tired of the gray skies of the capital, I wanted sunshine, I wanted to feel alive.

I arrived, and it felt like I had been born again. Everything around me was so colorful and warm. It was 20 degrees Celsius in the south and 5 degrees Celsius in the north. And I didn't want to go back. I wanted to recover, I wanted a change of town. I was tired of the frantic rhythm of the metropolis.

But my wife had other plans. A job offer came up, and she came back. She had to move out of the apartment, get her things. She did it alone and stayed there. I thought we would go back to Rostov-on-Don for a few months, live in our own place, help each other out. She thought I would come back with her and we would work like crazy together, sharing the workload.

A couple of months later I came to visit her for her birthday and it was a wonderful weekend. We spent it in a tourist town, not far from Moscow, and when I drove back, we agreed to meet for our anniversary and live together again in September.

But just a couple of weeks later we started having a serious spat. The whole month of July. She was talking about how I left her alone and chose to run away from my problems. That her birthday weekend was a big handout to me. I said that she chose to be careerist rather than show support in this relationship. That I had completely stopped getting to know the person I was married to. And the sad part is that we had this conversation before and I thought it was a passed story. But it wasn't.

A couple of weeks ago she and I had another conversation. She said she would be thinking about getting a divorce. Whether we should give this relationship another chance. We didn't talk for a long time. I tried to prepare myself for a negative outcome. Still sent a gift on our anniversary.

I got nothing in return. And in the evening the words that the gifts served as a nice reminder of our past. And that she had decided to get a divorce.

I just feel devastated. I struggle with myself and my emotions, but I feel pathetic. I've been trying to get over it alone, but I can't and I break down into incomprehensible howls and tears. It's like I've been abandoned for being depressed and not being able to ""be strong.""",hotlinedanya,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wev0gf/i_just_need_support_or_a_conversation_im_22_years/

They declined and got me enrolled in a school of THEIR choice. Now that I'm on the brink of breaking down, They want me to go to the school regularly.

I'm fucking done with everything. They think that I'm actually at fault here and I feel like fucking dying.

Us and Them,"I consider this to be the best day of my life/the most depressing day of my life. This was close to 5 and a half years ago, and I would like to think I'm over it, but I still dwell on it from time to time. (Backstory: I had been homeschooled my entire life, but I never thought anything out of the ordinary about it. That was just how my life had always been. I just though it was normal) Anyways, the day was March 25th, 2017, and I was just chilling in my room on a cloudy Saturday afternoon. It didn't seem like anything was different about that day at first, it was just a normal, boring day. I remember being on Skype at the time, and I get a message from my friend's gf at the time asking me if I wanted to go to her school play. I was kind of caught off guard by it since I had never really hung out with friends before outside of them coming over to my house, but I wasn't opposed to the idea at all. It surprised me that someone had asked me to even go to something like that. It made me feel appreciated and important, which was new for me I guess. I remember calling my father to ask him if he could give me a ride later that night to the high school, and he was surprisingly more than happy to drive me. So 6:30 rolls around and we hit the road. My father had put in his Dark Side of the Moon CD, which I had heard bits and pieces of the songs here and there, but never in their entirety. We get to the neighborhood right next to my friend's high school and the intro to the song Us and Them starts to play. We come over the hill and I start to see the school. The combination of a slow, sad sounding, psychedelic song mixed with arriving at a place that, deep down I feel like i should've been there all along, did something to me in that moment. It almost made me realize something, but I hadn't figured out what that thing was. So my father drops me off and I step inside the highschool. Imagine you've been slightly alone the majority of your life, and then walking into a building with hundreds of kids the same age as you. It was a little overwhelming, but it was the first time I had felt normal and important to other kids my age. So I walk in and I find my friend waiting in line for their school play, ""The Sound of Music."" I had never been out with a friend before, and even though it was just a school play, I ended up enjoying every minute of it. So it's 10 P.M. and my father shows up to take me back home. The car ride was quiet, not that there was anything wrong with that, it just added to the sort of somber yet sentimental atmosphere of that day. We get back home and I hop back onto Skype to talk to my friend and his then gf to thank them for inviting me to their school. I remember I was about to get off of the call and saying ""You know I don't know why, but I feel kinda tired and sad right now, but I have no idea why."" After I hung up, I felt like I had been gut punched. My emotions started to swell and I started bawling my eyes out. It hit me. Everything that had occurred that day made me realize how much I had missed out on in my life at that point.

My depression can get bad because I'm not good at anything,"I don't really know how to deal with my emotions. I suffer from pretty bad depression naturally that hits me pretty often, and that on its own sucks a lot. But I also am very talentless and, even when I work really hard at things, I never improve. This is after looking up resources and having people coach me on things and practicing a lot. This goes for games I love, singing, writing, or honestly anything I try to do. Whenever I try to put in effort, it not only feels like it's in vain with how impossible it is to achieve results, but also I never seem to improve. Pretty sure I have a learning disability that makes it hard to take in new information, as well.

Doesn't help that these feelings stack on top of my already intense feelings of being worthless.

I look online and I get responses like ""this just FEELS like you're bad at things when you are better than you think"". But that's not the case, I'm genuinely not good at anything no matter how hard I try, never have been, I'm beyond mediocre.

I will never be able to move on from my childhood.,"I turned sixteen this year. I know that adulthood is much different from my teenage years, but nothing is comparable to my childhood.

I visited my childhood home recently and now the street is empty, no basketball hoops or bicycles in the middle of the road. Everybody has already grown up. Although I haven’t seen her in years, my childhood dog died too, and with it I feel the last remaining slivers of my childhood have as well. I’m not suited for adulthood. I’m really not.

My childhood is the only time where I have truly felt happy. Why did it go by so fast, and why did I take it for granted?

I’m 18 and hope already seems lost,"I’m only just 18 and life already seems so hopeless,
I’ve distanced myself from everyone I know, I always have, i’m introverted at heart but now I just feel so truly alone, i’ve never wanted a big friend group or anything like that but outside of my family I didn’t even get a happy birthday from anyone but it’s my own fault for never bothering to get close to anybody.

It’s been almost a year and i’m still not over my ex, i still check her instagram see her new boyfriend and feel awful, she was such an awful person to me yet I just can’t imagine dating anyone else.

Anything i’ve tried to improve at and be good at I just can’t appear to achieve anything meaningful no matter the time or effort i try to put into it, i’m very good at getting mediocre at things quickly but anything past that appears impossible.

The passions and interests i have just seemed to have waned I used to love math and physics and all that nerdy shit but now i can’t seem to enjoy any of it anymore.

I don’t shower unless i absolutely need to, i don’t brush my teeth or really take care of myself in any of the ways i should be as i just can’t seem to care about myself or my future.

I’m going into my final year of secondary school which is a really important year for me but my motivation is at an all time low and this scares me as it could make it unlikely for me to go to college.

I’ve been on anti-depressants and they didn’t change anything, i’ve gone to the shitty council therapy that they offer for under 18’s and the whole 9 yards, none of it seemed to help.

Absolutely nobody texts or really talks to me, my life consists of going to a workplace that leaves me alone with my thoughts for hours which honestly only appears to damage my mental health more, playing games that i don’t even particularly enjoy and sleeping, that’s it.

I’ve been talked out of suicide by my ex girlfriend and mom so i don’t really see it as an option anymore but man i just don’t feel like i’m alive, i’m just living because i can’t be fucked to kill myself.

I’ve probably got enough money to cough up on private therapy and i don’t spend money on anything really but is it really worth it? i’m just lost on what the do anymore.

i’m not really sure what this post is for, just sort of shouting into empty space as i don’t have anyone to say this to, my parents as much as they don’t want me to kill myself aren’t very helpful when it comes to my mental health and well my ex, has me blocked almost everywhere you could imagine, including chess.com haha.",uDenn,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weud3f/im_18_and_hope_already_seems_lost/
I'm starting to wonder if I even want to be happy,"It's nice to feel happy in those times I do, but when I'm not it feels like there's no point in trying so hard to be happy. It's so draining to keep up a good mood, and it feels like I'm ignoring those questions I don't have an answer to, like what's the point, what am I working towards, why am I doing this if it doesn't bring me any kind of joy?

If it takes so much effort to be happy and I get nothing back from the world in return, why should I even bother being happy? I can lift my mood, but I still don't know what the hell it is I'm living for. What good does it do to be happy and productive if none of that work leads towards anything meaningful? I'm so tired of it. The world feels fake. All the things im supposed to want don't mean anything to me. I don't want to die, I just want to feel some kind of gratification, some kind of justification for toiling away endlessly doing obligatory tasks I don't really care about. 

And I know I'm only 24, I've got my whole life ahead of me blah blah but I've wasted the last 6 years of my life slowly chipping away at a degree to get a job I hate less. But I don't care about that, I don't know what I want, I don't even know if I want to be alive for sure. It hurts because I've done nothing with myself and have no idea how to change that or if it's even worth changing.

I was doing so much better. I've been prioritizing my physical health, which has been helping me mentally, but suddenly in the last 1-2 weeks I've been feeling so awful.

I had gotten into the habit of taking an anti-anxiety pill whenever they struck but today I obviously didn't have them. It was so awful.

I love and miss it so much. Between the ages 4 to about 10. I wish my family still owned the house I grew up in. I miss my room, my yard, and not having a single care in world. I miss living with my siblings and mom. I miss the ones who were once here. I miss having the constant feeling of optimism and big dreams. I miss being happy. I feel like my inner child is so disappointed in my adult self. It’s alarming how many times a day I wish I could end my pain. I’ve been wondering lately that if I were to end it, if I could relive it in another world and start over. But then I would leave my family in pain in this life.

Because not only am I starting to shut people out, but the one line that goes “and I really hope I don’t wake up at 50 wondering why I gave my life away, and if it’s too late”… that line hits me hard - because I know that’s how I’m going to feel.

I have never told anyone about what happened, as I can’t trust anyone to keep things to themselves. Not even family. If we didn’t have a life we built together I would’ve left immediately and continue my life entirely alone. Most people think loyalty and respect comes with love, but in so many causes that is just not true. Being lonely and hurting by myself is just so…well painful. I don’t know how to move on or even really won’t to anymore. I rather pass, as it seems to be the only way to quite the mind.

Today I really wanted to end it,"Today was on of those days. I am 40 and have depression since I am a child. I have PTSD due to abused I suffer from my childhood. I am medicated but it stop working after a few days. My shrink is really nice and try really hard to find something that works on me but he is starting to say that I am part of the 2% who's no medication works.
I see depression like a little monkey with cymbals. You know like the one you rewind and it starts hitting the cymbals and make a horrific noise. 
My everyday goal is not to find the monkey. But the sucker looks at me with his smile, like saying you won't make it. But I fight. I try to do stuff. Getting dress is like climbing Everest, but I do my best to do it. 
But today was one of the day where the monkey won. It was a horrific day. I woke up early tried to do stuff while listening to podcasts. But the monkey didn't stop saying that the people I was listening to are living a life and that I don't have one. So the monkey started to compare me to people on the podcast. "" At this age he did that, what did you do"" or when they talk about a period of time, like 10 years ago for exemple the monkey tells me "" you were 30 at that time, it was yesterday and years ago at the same time, what did you do ? "". He even make me feel around my neck the burning sensation of the hangman rope.
I can't help it. I really do my best. I have friends who knows me for years and keep telling me that I have accomplished alot. But I can't help it 
I am gonna tell you why today I didn't listen to the monkey even if the sound of is cymbals was outstanding. 
I have an amazing partner. She is always there for me. She loves me like no one ever did. She is so innocent, pure. She comes for a loving family and really tries hard to understand what I went through. That's why I don't want to end it, I can't. I don't want her to ever go the trauma of coming home and finding me swinging from a belt in my office. She does not deserve that.
I am going to bed now, and tomorrow when I wake up I am gonna restart my struggles with the monkey. I am gonna fight and I am going to win, or at least make him quiet for a bit. 
But I know the sucker will be looking at me with is smile going hear to hear. But I'll make him make before he can play. That will be my little victory.

Yawn,"... I just moved to a new city. I'm horrible at making new friends. I'm naturally fairly quiet and I've been told that I come across as cold and intimidating to people who don't know me. It doesn't help that I simply don't have any interest in being friends with most people that I come across. 

sigh. 

It must be nice to be the sort of person who is happy to make friends and socialize with pretty much anyone. 

I hate the feeling that I'm wasting time. I'm not going back to school until the winter semester. I don't really need to work right now, and I don't really have any interest in doing so either...

There's a dead tree that I can see from my window, ravens like hanging out on it for some reason. I envy the way they live, most of them seem to have a partner, there seems to be a sense of community among them... It would be nice, living a simple life, flying around... Being a person is fine, but it's messy and needlessly complicated- humans have a lot of potential as individuals, but I feel like society isn't really healthy for us. 

hmm... Well, whatever, I'm not even looking for advice or anything really. I guess I just wish that I had more interest in doing anything, or that I had someone interesting to do boring stuff with, or that... hm... shrug. I don't know. I'll manage I guess.

I just feel like a constant failure all the time, I work at a shitty dead end job that I don’t even like and didn’t even wanna stay at this long but I still don’t have my license because of anxiety issues and not having someone else who has an ID so I can feel comfortable learning to drive.

I used to be smart, idk if I still am and just gave up on everything or I’ve just lost all will to try and better myself. It just feels like there’s no way out of the shitty situation I’m in except for offing myself.

People continuously expect too much of me and I came to the realization about a month ago that I’m pretty sure I’ve been legitimately autistic my whole life but my parents didn’t want to accept that reality and never got me any kind of help to avoid making *themselves* look bad. I feel like everyone around me thinks of me as re#arded despite me never telling anyone I had any issues worse than just anxiety and depression. It’s all just in how other people treat me. It just feels like people think I’m a lot dumber than I actually am. 

I don’t feel like I could ever have the life I wanted at this point. Every cry for help I’ve tried to give just lead to hostility and fear mongering. I just don’t want to exist anymore because I know I’ve let so many people including myself down.

I have no more energy to try and better myself, I barely ever have the energy to get through the day. All I want is to be happy but no matter what I do or try I end up in a lot of mental and emotional anguish.

Lithium and depression,"So I’ve tried many medications for my depression, one of them that I have been on for over a year is lithium. I never really felt like it did anything and I am so extremely thirsty and it makes me shake. 

I tried to lower my lithium dose over a month ago with the help of a psychiatrist and for a couple of weeks I felt better than I had in a long time. Not manic or anything I just felt like things would be ok. But now I’ve crashed into a depression, and I spoke to my mental health nurse saying I didn’t want to go back on more lithium. 

She spoke to a psychiatrist and they told me to bring up my lithium dose a little bit but not back to what it was. But I’m not feeling better. Today they told me to go back on the full dose of lithium and I feel like have haven’t been listened to at all. And I worry that when I finally get to see my psychiatrist she will insist I stay on the lithium instead of finding a more bearable solution. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m so depressed and I know I should just take the lithium, I’m just so tired of medication and the side effects. 
When I thought I’d be able to come off the lithium I was ok with the side effects because I knew I wouldn’t have to deal with it forever, but now it seems like I’ll have to be on it for much longer I can’t bear the idea and it makes me so sad. 

I don’t know how to stick up for myself and I’d never bring someone to my appointments. It’s all just too much.

I'm 15 and a rising sophomore in hs. I feel like a disappointment and a failure to everybody around me. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore or try to change myself for the better. I want to kms but I don't have the courage to do so when I think about the people around me. I just don't know what to do anymore. I wanted to become a psychiatrist but it feels pointless now, I am basically failed my first year of hs. I know I can do better if I try but I just can't seem to find any motivation to do so. 

I just stopped trying to do good in school, became more introverted the past few years. I used to be extremely extroverted and I thought it was because I moved to us from India so I wasn't used to everything so I became introverted but it seems like I was depressed way before than I thought I was. I have a poor self esteem because my family since they comment about my body a lot. I know they are doing it so I can change but it doesn't help me. I want to tell them all of this, to make them stop making me feel worse everyday but they already went through so much and I don't want to add more burden or things they need to worry about. I wanted to talk to my best friend about this but I feel like I would burden her so here I am. 

Whenever I have some motivation to do something about myself, someone in my family says something and I get angry and just don't do it anymore. I did try ignoring them but my relationship with them got really bad because we argued everyday and stuff and so I act like I'm fine with them so it's pretty hard to just block them out. 

My mom has breast cancer and had mastectomy recently and my grandpa is getting a surgery soon because one of his heart walls deteriorated a lot. My mom is a single parent who raises me and my brother (22 but he moved to a different state). She doesn't really know how I feel since I've never told her, she recently went through the surgery I mentioned earlier and she got one removed so her breasts removed so self esteem is pretty low as well. She always says how weird she looks and how weird her body looks. I really don't want her to feel like that because to me, she doesnt look like that at all. I don't understand why I look so bad to her when she doesn't to me. I do tell her that she doesn't look weird or anything like that but I don't think she really understands.

I lived with my grandparents for two years because my brother and mother went to us and I couldn't go yet since I didn't have my visa. During that time, my grandmother was extremely abusive and manipulative. I don't know how to feel about her right now even though I know she guilt-trips a lot and abused me before. She is living with us atm because of my mother's illness and she has gotten better. I think. But when I lived with her, I was in fourth grade and I almost committed suicide because my mother never abused me physically and mentally before, but I didn't have the courage to do it when I thought of my mother and how she would feel. I still want to do it but I still can't find the courage. I know I should tell my family about all this but that would just add more burden and I don't want to be more of a burden than I already am. What should I do? I don't know what to do anymore. Should I just tell them?

I’m so tired of having to push myself to hold a conversation with someone , to smile , to get up out of bed, to be an adult, to simply just live life. I’m beyond tired. I’m tired of being anxious. I have extreme anxiety. It keeps me away from sooooo many things in life. I cried because every time my boyfriend is playing with his friends online and I hear him laugh it just reminds me that I’m just sitting on his bed on my phone because I don’t have any friends. I’m 22 year old female with not one friend. i miss having friends &amp; going out but I get extremely anxious socializing now because of stupid things that happened to me. my bf is like my only friend. and when I don’t have him I don’t have anyone. and i hate it so much that i depend on him for everything. I don’t even have my drivers license because i get too anxious driving. I know his tired of me. I can see it in his eyes. I’m scared I’m going to lose him too. I’m trying so damn hard to push myself out of this dark hole but I’m stuck. I’m embarrassed of myself. I feel like I don’t even have myself. I don’t even know who I am. I don’t know what I like to do. what’s my favorite color or my favorite food. what I like to make a hobby. idk who I am and that’s the worst part. It’s hard to keep myself together when idk who I am. i cant keep trying. and to make things worse I have so many health issues on top of my mental health. I’m just so damn tired of doing this. I feel dead. I feel like I live in hell. this isn’t life. life is beautiful. I know life isn’t just sunshine &amp; rainbows. I know life has its very hard dark days, but why is everyday I have dark. When will I have a day of just rainbows &amp; sunshine. just ONE day. with no worries , no pain. i try sooo hard everyday , I push myself so hard to keep doing better just for me to keep having breakdowns and realizing that I’m trying but it’s not working .",Odd-Caterpillar6814,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weiwls/dumb_rant_just_ignore_me_just_needed_to_get_it/
Barely holding myself together so I can continue my gender transition,"I’m a 17 year old trans guy. I turn 18 in the next 3 months and have been waiting for years to start my transition due to a non supportive family. I started T in January and I’m so happy but I lied to get it. The doctor asked me if I struggled with mental illness. Mostly depression and anxiety. I admitted I did but when she asked me if I still struggled I lied and said I’m much better now. I said that because I was scared that if I was honest she was going to tell me I wasn’t mentally ready to start T. I needed this. I needed T. For months, I’ve been trying to hold myself together enough to make it through top surgery before I can finally stop bottling it all up. I’m scared that if I open up they’ll cancel my consult for top surgery and take me off T.

I day dream about being dead.,"So I've always had a curiosity about the past, people who lived in it, history etc..


Well recently, as in the last few months, I've gained an interest in the 60-70-80's and key people from those years. The stories of John Belushi and Doug Kennedy in particular stick out to me and make me feel that, perhaps, they received the best fate possible. They're remembered, with reverence, by a LOT of people. Not to mention people I myself personally know (knew?)...Dead, gone, and yet people love them, more so in death than in life.


I'm not suicidal,  not in the traditional sense. I was in a coma in 2012 for 2 weeks and ever since that, l've wanted to die. Sometimes I go through periods where the idea strikes my conscious a little more intensely than others but I wouldn't actively pursue my own death...however I'd be very, very disappointed if it were prevented again.

I'm stuck,"I'm struggling real bad with my depression. I've tried like 6 different medications and none of them have helped at all and healthcare professionals I talk to keep transferring me to other professionals because everyone is at a loss about what to do with me, and I feel bad because all those professionals truly want to help me but I keep failing to respond to any treatment.  It's been 8 years and nothing has helped me. 

My biggest issue currently is my free time. I have energy to do some things, but problem is that absolutely nothing interests me or gives me satisfaction. I'm just so numb to everything at this point. So I just lay in my bed and watch YT videos, because my thoughts go super dark if I'm not doing something. But every time I kinda feel like I could do something, I just.. can't. I used to draw and take walks, but those just irritate me now instead of making me feel good. I could cook, but all food is just like cardboard in my mouth. This also makes grocery shopping even more taxing than it already is, because I don't wanna eat anything on the shelves but I gotta buy SOMETHING, y'know? So I just walk around aimlessly until I have a random assortment of goods in my cart that looks like it'd feed me for a week. 

I can't come up with any hobby I'd actually wanna bother with. I've looked into options but I genuinely have no interest for ANYTHING. Like. At all. So I just sit around at home, waiting for the night to come so I can sleep instead of anxiously thinking ""what should I do, I have to do something I've been inside for a week, I have to do something but I don't wanna but I gotta..."" all day. 

This existence is exhausting and it's been so long that at this point I'm starting to think maybe I don't even have depression, maybe I'm just not a person who is capable of enjoying life? Maybe I'm just not meant for this? I don't know what to do anymore.",MusicalMiddleFinger,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wefwtx/im_stuck/

Feeling just fine, but once uni starts again I'll be damned 

I just want to disappear, start cutting again, die maybe cause I see no point in living even though life is pretty fun sometimes. I feel like I have no one to lean on. Got ditched by my former boyfriend after being diagnosed. My only true friend is out of my country. I get it, everyone is going through a lot of shit but hey I'm one of those ""everyone"".

I'm just tired. I want to wake up one day and feel fine. How does it even feel. To be fine.. I just want to be left alone and do nothing and... And since I'm nothing I don't see a point in existing.

is that a sort of anxiety attack?,"I've been so used to things like this that I somehow never questioned it but today I actually started wondering if what I have is sort of an anxiety attack. 

I always only knew panic attacks and the symptoms didn't really match mine. Yeah I have trouble breathing but I don't feel like I'm gonna gave an heartattack or anything like that(I know it's simplified but you get what I mean)

It's rather like I'm losing my mind?

So when I have a rather okay day, I tend to not get too much bothered by crowds and ppl in general. I don't feel comfortable but I'm not really anxious but there are days, when I really don't feel good, my reaction changes so much. 

So it often starts with me feeling a little disoriented (just a little bit) and it grows into some sort of overwhelming stimulation, like friends talk to me and I feel confused, unable to really comprehend what they say and I wish I could tell them to just leave me alone rn because its too much. My breathing gets faster but I'm not even sure if my heartbeat is actually going faster. I just feel like I can't breath properly. I often start to sweat. Almost simultanously, my legs begin to shake as if all my energy had been just drained from my body and I use all I have left to keep my body up(I feel like if I give in, I would just collapse on the ground) Talking to ppl in this situation is incredibly hard and I have to restrain myself from shouting at them to shut up and to leave me alone. I feel totally weird, like I'm not completely there (not dissociating, where you lose all sense of your surroundings and can't remember what happened) but at the same time I'm hyperly aware of my surroundings (at least when it happens in public, which it does 90% of the time). It's this weird mix of panic, overstimulation and dissociating.

When I sit down, put my headphones on I tend to get myself to calm down quite quickly but I get so tired after, that it's hard for me to even keep my eyes open and I wish for nothing more than to lay in my comfortable bed.

I feel so depressed and lost and I have no idea what to do or who to talk to.,"Hello everyone, 

I am a 24 year old female working in IT. I just graduated from college in January, and I thought everything would get better for me (aka I thought I’d be less depressed) after I landed a job in a different state, which is something I’ve always wanted to do. However, I unfortunately turned out to be wrong. For a short background story, I’ve pretty much dealt with depression and anxiety all my life, especially growing up in an abusive household. I always struggled in school (elementary, middle, high school, and college) and had a very difficult time finishing college. I failed almost all of my classes and got on academic probation twice. I was trying to major in biology at first because my parents forced me to (they wanted me to be a doctor), and even though I didn’t want to, I tried. But, depression and the lack of interest got to me and I ended up not majoring in biology which made my parents extremely angry. I honestly had nothing I was passionate about, so I just chose to try to major in computer science because you could make good money with it. Well, it ended up being too hard for me (and my mental health) and I ended up failing all of my classes and getting into academic probation. And, I was in therapy when I started to major in computer science. I also have to mention that at this time I was struggling with an eating disorder and with my weight, so that has also added a lot to my depression and anxiety. I just felt awful about myself; my abusive parents, my weight, my eating (this was my coping mechanism at the time and it still kind of is, although not as bad as before), failing all of my classes, pretty much having no social life, etc. So, my therapist told me to take some easy classes so that I could get out of the probation, and so I did. That’s what saved me from getting kicked out. So then, I decided to choose an easier major, IT (it’s very easy in my university) so I think that’s why I was able to graduate. Around this time I also started to take ADHD medication which helped me a lot with studying and actually getting work done in school. I was able to focus and had more motivation then I’ve ever had in my life. But then, the medication stopped working and actually started to give me panic attacks so I stopped using it. I then went to another psychiatrist and she prescribed me antidepressants which kind of helped. Thankfully also around this time I was able to land an internship in a different state and I was so happy about it. I was like wow, I can’t believe I actually succeeded at something for once. Plus, it was in a different state which meant that I could stay away from my family there. That internship was amazing, laid back, and I got to have so much fun because I was not under the control of my family. Plus, the internship was in a state which was very hot and sunny and I found that this helped my moods. After the internship, the company offered me a full time position after I graduated college and I was very happy to accept it. The pay was good and plus I got the chance to move out of my family’s house for good, somewhere far away. I love the place I live in now. However, right now I am 6 months into my job and I’m feeling extremely depressed again. The job is much more stressful than I thought it would be (it’s a tech support type role) and I didn’t really have proper training. The problems I have to try to solve are really difficult and I still don’t feel comfortable taking cases at all. What made it even more difficult for me is that I was assigned a mentor, but she was incredibly rude to me and never seemed like she wanted to help. She would always scold me for not understanding a customer issue or not doing something correctly, or even asking her for help. I had a secondary mentor too and unfortunately he was also not that nice and was condescending sometimes. Right now I am at the point where I feel like this job is way too stressful for me and I just feel so burnt out, anxious, and depressed. This job is all I think about and I try to do everything I can to distract myself and it’s not helping. The thing that’s giving me the most anxiety is that if I quit or get fired, I will have to pay back my sign on bonus to the company, which is A LOT of money for me. I just feel stuck, lost, and like a failure again. Why can’t I just suck it up and do the job like my other coworkers? Why can’t I just have at least an ounce of motivation? Why do I feel so fucking depressed again? Why is everything I’m doing not helping (therapy, antidepressants, distractions)? I work from home, so yesterday and today I left my place to drive around and do random stuff because I just couldn’t stand looking at that computer screen, and at this point I don’t care if I get fired anymore. But, at the same time I’m scared because if I do get fired or quit, that bonus will be taken away and my healthcare benefits will be gone. Anyone have any advice? I feel like I’ve tried to talk to so many people about this but I still feel like I really need help, I don’t know what to do. Thanks for listening. 

I also have to mention that my mother is pressuring me to get married and will not stop talking about it everyday. She has crazy expectations for my boyfriend and expects that we get married by next summer and that he has to get me a very expensive ring or else she will be angry (which I am not going to listen to her, but the fact that she keeps bringing this up and gets angry when I don’t agree with her is driving me crazy). She also complains about my weight (she has done so all my life and still complains till this day). She calls me fat and says that I don’t look good anything, and she even thinks my boyfriend probably doesn’t like my body.

He loved a dead girl more than me,"My boyfriend recently just broke up with me. Everything hurts. All the hours we spent on the phone together, the music playlist he made for me, telling me I’m the most beautiful girl he’ll ever love. It all feels unreal. Recently I was going through his Spotify because I missed him, and noticed a playlist named “Elley’s playlist” which was 15+ hours of love songs and songs about loving an insecure girl (ex. She will be loved by Maroon 5) Which is a lot more than the measly 58 min playlist he made me. Elley is a friend he grew up with and she passed away. Am I wrong for being jealous of a dead girl?

"I can't talk to people, not without completely hating myself","don't know how to solve this.  Before I completely isolated myself from my classmates, I already hated myself in any attempt to communicate with them (and anyone else).  I corrupted my identity daily to be a person who doesn't represent me, just to be able to talk to my friends and make friends.  When I don't embrace the character the results are even worse, as my thoughts don't sync with my lines and all that comes out are disconnected and involuntary words that I wouldn't have liked to say.  I hate myself with every word that comes out of my mouth.  But still, I hadn't walked away, it was simply moving on despite all the self-hatred.  At the beginning of the year I had an episode of depersonalization that lasted just over a month, I walked away from everyone and only returned (inevitably) when classes resumed.  But that day I felt the need to be in the presence of other people and I ""fitted in"" again.  Now that I don't feel that, it's different, I find myself in a state of deep inertia, I don't feel like talking to anyone (which isn't necessarily a bad thing because at least I don't hate myself that much) or doing anything other than the activities. I spend breaks in my desk and sometimes I feel like leaving classes because the classroom becomes an unbearable environment.  It's excruciating when someone I used to talk to starts a conversation.  I would spend the day quiet if my friend (who wants to have sex with me) don't waste so much of your time trying to cheer me up.  I know he will soon get tired of me and my condition, and I will be alone.

I'll probably gonna try it again," about 6 months ago i tried to kill  myself went to a train station (it wasn't my first time on suicide  attempt, but that time i decide to go to a deadly place)

I  sat there on the bench, for a long time, then i stood up, got near the  train, one passed away i couldn't make myself to do it, second train  came in, i took few steps back, prepend to run towards the rail,    inspector has suspect that I'm going to do something ""crazy"" he stopped  me and i ran away from the station

i  tried to do better again keep taking my medicines, go to therapist and  psychiatrist found new friends that might care about me and i decided to  deny the existence of the situation to deal with life

I  knew that i wouldn't be able to work outside anymore because of other  problems, mentally and sleeping disorders.i saved some money and tried  to make a step towards the goal of working from home, i've learned  investment in stocks, and nowadays i try to do my best to succeeded in  that.

but i usually ask myself if it worth the try and today i am broken, the deny of the situation have hit me in the face

now  I'm thinking to myself, nothing is worth it, the friends aren't worth  it, the hard work doesn't worth it, the treatment doesn't worth it, and  I'm not going to be hospitalized like a monster I'm thinking about  correcting the mistake i did I'll return to the same station, I'll send  the friends my will, and I'll ran again without messing around like last  time that suffering will end, in a matter of seconds, i can't deal with  life anymore happiness is not in reach but i get a smile just from  thinking about the train, instant crush, no way back, not going to be  crippled for a stupid other act, it would be deadly

i've  tried in the past suicide hotlines on crisis but the only thing they  did to me is bringing me cops &gt;then go to hospital&gt; then they ask  me if i want to be hospitalized&gt;deny&gt;home

if  i'll say something to a friend they might do the same, or they will cut  the friendship probably and the family couldn't care less about my  depression i think i'm going all the way this time, it feels like i  don't have anything to loose anymore",ofir817,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/wepx9l/ill_probably_gonna_try_it_again/

Undiagnosed but questioning if I may have an issue or if I am just too emotional.,"I have gone through depressive episodes ranging from days to weeks. I am 30 now but have been experiencing these episodes for at least the last 9 or 10 years. I saw a doctor about them when they kept recurring on a monthly to bi-monthly basis. The doctor told me that because they don’t last longer than a few days that it wasn’t depression. I am questioning his opinion now.

During the week I feel fine most days. I keep very busy. I have work, school, am an avid gym goer and a multitude of other hobbies. The weekends scare the shit out of me. If I am stagnant I usually get that voice in my head that bombards me with negative thought patterns. These can last into the next week until I start getting back into my routine, which can be very hard to start up.

I recently made the connection with my down and out weekends and stagnation. I had few if any episodes during the winter this year. This year was also the first time I started reffing hockey. My weekend was full of physical and  mental activity. Now that it is the summer, I am going through more and more of these episodes.

These episodes cause a lot of issues in my relationship. They make it hard to get motivated for anything and make me want to hide away. 

I cant help but wonder sometimes “what is wrong with me?” When I see people that are happy all the time. I struggle to keep myself baseline more days than not. Ive done a lot of therapy and it doesn’t help me feel better, it just helps me control my reactions to things.  Im sick of this cycle.

life is just so pointless when you don't care about following the system,"I don't want to get a degree on some bullshit just to pay bills when i can survive with my wageslave job and study what i want on my own (plus i hate working with people and the utter bullshit that is the school system). I don't want to work because it's just prostituition for food at this point. I don't want to marry some stressed person and likely divorce her losing half my shit because no marriage ever lasts theses days. I don't want to have kids because it's just transfering my pain to another thing that likely will suffer just as much as I do.

There is nothing left if you don't care about these things, because that's what life is. You will never become a rockstar, a war hero, so living like an average Joe is what you have.

Therapist called me brave…but I’m not sure.,"Picture this: Typical strict parents. Anything less than an A means failure, constantly told to be a doctor, compared to more successful family members constantly (and still now). As a child I was adamant about being an artist and vocalized this to the family, making me the black sheep for a long time. 

I stuck to my guns no matter what and pursued art, entering multiple contests through middle to high school in my district and got a associates in art and then a bachelor of fine arts. I feel like I should be proud, but I feel uneasy. 

A month before my graduation, my cousin got a nursing degree where they make 40-50$ an hour. I know we all have our own journeys in life and my therapist tried to reassure me that I should be proud of myself and I was brave for standing up for my values. Jealousy is sinking in though since I’ve yet to find a job. I hate feeling regretful. I hate that I’m starting to not like making art anymore either because of these feelings.

Is it normal to feel like this? I know the job market is particularly hell right now but it still hurts feeling like I failed myself.",Sudden_Ordinary_9476,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/weom41/therapist_called_me_bravebut_im_not_sure/
I feel like I’m wasting my life.,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression and I feel like crap. I’m doing college online for Computer Science, and it’s sometimes difficult to even get up in the morning to do my course work. 

Everyday I keep thinking to myself that I’m wasting my time going to college because I feel like my future is going to be nothing. I haven’t finished a course in 2 months and I’m starting to feel like an idiot for that. No matter how hard I try; I just can’t seem to do good enough. When I wanted to learn how to code on my own, I kept giving up even when I tell myself not to. 

I know it might be better to go to college physically, but I just can’t see myself being around other students without panicking. I want to keep pushing forward with my studies, however I keep losing motivation to keep going. All I see myself doing is just playing video games for the rest of my life.

ex suffers from depression and drug addiction,"hey. i have depression myself so i definitely know how hard it can be to socialize and talk about ones problems when facing a severe depressive phase. still, i feel very hopeless and fearful about something:
my ex and i broke up last year. he always said he is too numb to feel love and that he just doesn't want to hurt me so thats why he then began to distance himself. this year, march, he tried to k*** himself. he also was in rehab 2-3 times because of drug addiction and he still takes drugs. i don't know if he's still addicted but this just adds to his depression. he is traumatized by some things that happened in his past and always says that he is cynical; doesn't trust anyone. so that obviously makes it hard for me to help him. i know that it's not my responsibility to help him but still, he is important to me. knowing he is struggling so much makes me so worried and i just don't know what to do. he said we shouldn't meet up anymore and that i'm better off without him. i respect his boundaries so i told him i will leave him alone but also said that i still offer him help if he's willing to take it.
well i know there isn't much i can do so i probably have to accept that i can't help him. i can't decide for him and i know that. but i still wake up from nightmares and find myself crying at least once a week because i'm just so worried. i can't just accept that maybe he will try to do it again.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  
*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,251,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/
Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",SQLwitch,43,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/

"I don't get it. Society doesn't want me alive, but doesn't want me to die either?","There's just something I can't wrap my head around. I've grown up in the culture that suicide should be prevented. That there are compassionate people who would want to stop you, plead with you. They can't help you otherwise... but they'll help you then. Help...?

So I cling to this idea but I don't understand it. I'm not helped by society otherwise. Any amount of time of the street I would most certainly pass away. People do all the time. Nobody cares.

Why do they care suddenly when you're not (yet) a homeless nobody and it's suicide...?

I also just don't understand, why if I'm so useless, and need to be taken care of, if I shouldn't just die? I don't get it? I can't live. No one should have to use their life to supporting mine. Society doesn't make it happen. There are no supports to access for me, for millions of people. Don't people want us to die?

Can I get assisted suicide? I think in Canada they recently opened it up for people with mental health issues. I am scared of doctors... They aren't trustworthy. Honestly they are horrible people in their positions. Take advantage. I wish only people who wanted to be doctors became doctors. The people who wanted to be there because they cared. Honestly, the other folks just shouldn't be allowed. They do great harm.

It's such a dissonance that just brings me to panic tears. No one wants to keep me alive, but I'm supposed to believe they don't want me to die either?! It's just unfair!

If I just lay down and wait to die, I'm a burden on the people closest to me. There's just the one... That makes it harder... On me, because it's all on him then. But ultimately, to not have to afford me just seems like it would be so much better for him. Right? I mean that's just logic. It shouldn't be on just some other poor sucker to keep me alive. Yet it is. That's unfair. If I didn't eat, didn't have needs, didn't want thing, didn't influence decisions, then all his money would be his to choose what to do with. He'd have more of it.

Dad is diagnosed with last stage pancreas cancer. I wish it was me.,"The news dropped like a fucking bomb since dad always took such good care of his health and only showed non-specific symptoms 1-2 months ago which not even colonoscopy and ultrasonoscopy could tell it was cancer. He is totally not the best dad or husband but totally not an ill-minded person at heart and in no way deserved this.

I realized from childhood I'm incapable of loving anyone (not even my family) or experiencing satisfaction from anything I do or receive, and can only feel stress and shame. Dad says he doesn't want to be trapped in hospital and get chemotherapy which can only give a few more months, but wants to live free outside, only taking pills and pass away when the time comes. And yet I don't even feel anything like wanting him to try and prolong his life and live with us.

It would be nice if the one with cancer is not him who still looks forward to care for his family, but me who is already fucked up mentally and physically and has been wishing to die for years. I'm not even sure if I won't kill myself the next 10 years.

Shell of who I used to be.,"Everyone in my life has either used me or betrayed me in someway. Every long term relationship has ended with me being lied to or being cheated on. Every friendship was only vibrant in what I wish was a part of my life that didn't exist as a drug dealer. 

I have been used by everyone. I wish I could just be like a feral cat. Get struck by a car, go somewhere no one would find me or care to find me, and die. 

A year and 3 months sober means nothing when your change has no meaningful effect on your life. My weight loss from 230 to 160 is meaningless when looks aren't as important as the exchange of dopamine you can shortly give someone you've just met and even that always has an expiration date.

I am defined in my relationships as someone who is angry although I've never used violence in a relationship I've been accused of emotionally abusing someone because of my own emotional absence.

I remember about a year ago and 5 months I had spent 12 hours doing coke and drinking. I drew myself a bath and laid in it. I kept drinking heavily hoping I would eventually slip into a black out and die. Although my subconscious mind always pulled me from the water I hoped this would not define the remainder of my life, and would think back to this moment as my lowest.

But I feel like I never left that bath tub. I'm always drowning in what seems to be the same repeating simulated situations. Someone loves me, someone uses me, and my insecurities eat away at me.

Not a minute goes by that I don't consider my calling to the void. Everything at this point just seems so lucid. I smile and my customers love me at work, I go home I work out, I lay down and cry.

Currently living between life or death,"Hello everyone,

Been in a rough mental state for the past 3 months. My life has been going completely downhill. I once lived a joyous life with no sign of suicide at all. I felt like I had it all going for me honestly. But, the past 3 months have been absolute hell. My wife just told me that she doesn't want to be with me anymore (our 10 yr dating anniversary just passed on July 24) my mother hates me, I'm currently 20k in debt because of stupid decisions that I have made, and I have struggled with trying to ""better"" myself. My wife just told me an hour ago that I am a ""small minded motherfucker"" and that ""I will have no direction in life because I don't look at the bigger picture"". That doesn't help with my mental state and at this rate, she doesn't really care for how I feel. I don't think anybody does. I have our 2 dogs with me and I have a plan to drop them off at her house (we live separately, I live in Louisiana because of the military, she lives in California) and then killing myself on the way back somewhere in the middle of Texas. I know nobody will care. My wife told me that if I were to commit suicide, it would make me a coward and to instead, be a man and fight my demons. I have accepted that I will take the cowardly way out to let her know just how much of a coward her husband really was. My death will not only put weight off her shoulders, but weight off my mothers shoulders as well. I have came to conclusion that death is the only positive answer to my problems. I want to randomly disappear and never come back, so that is what I will do.

Feeling completely empty today. Might do it,"Long story short, I lost my best friend to suicide about 7 months ago and I've been horrible since. Lost my job, kicked out by my family, struggling in school. I had a small group of friends who knew about my situation, and while they acknowledged it, they never really openly offered to discuss it with me (not their fault though). 

I was supposed to have some big plans today with my friends, along with getting some coffee with another female friend beforehand. I woke up feeling ok for the first time in a while, only to have my friend cancel on me. That's alright, I thought. I sent my other friends a message asking when we were scheduled to go to our other event - only for them to be active on Instagram and not reply to it. Found out they changed plans last second and left without me. They saw the message and didn't reply, and now I've spent an entire afternoon doing nothing at all, alone with my deranged mind.

"When thinking about the amount of assholes there are in this world, I just don't want to be a part of it anymore","It just adds another huge reason to my list to finally end it all.

There are so many people out there, who only think about themselves or how they can damage others to make a profit, who only endeavor to hurt others, etc. While I have suicidal thoughts every day, I also like the idea of something, which just wipes all of humanity off the planet. There are so many bad apples around, whose only goal in life is to ruin that of others.

I see it everyday on my car, only 2 years old, but covered in scratches and dents. And no, it wasn't me how parked badly, or did them myself. So many people who don't care when opening their doors, when passing in between cars, or pushing their shopping cart. I even park further away to avoid those.

And that's just about a car. A thing. There are much, much, MUCH worse things out there, which PEOPLE have to endure, just because another individual wants to do so. There are plenty of people in this subreddit alone, to which this applies. All that needless pain which is wrought upon others, for no reason, than to gain something, be it money, or to satisfy sick urges.

36-year-old unemployed willing to sign a contract,"Dear Internet,

I am a 36-year-old unemployed male living with my 80+ year old Grandmother who still works.

Last year I lost my life savings in a long-con, my stepfather, and divorced my wife. This is not mean’t to be a sob story, just seeking advice.

**I want nothing more in my life** **but to..**

* A) Have my Grandmother live without working and to financially support her fully
* B) Have a job (remote, but beggars can’t be choosers)
* C) Rent my own place.

**I have...**

* I have no degree.
* A long history of contract writing along with experience in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
* A current contract position similar to DoorDash. It's seasonal.

I am not sure how to ask for help here. I contemplated writing this due to the potential backlash but I don’t care anymore, I am just trying.

For awhile now, I’ve been unsure how to apply myself towards junior front-end development jobs or really be anybody that anybody wants.

I’ve kept applying on and off and had two interviews within the span of 4 years.

Two years ago I took a $10,000 bootcamp in San Francisco that assured job placement, and I’ve never felt dumber in my life. Apparently, my work was good and I have a portfolio.

Recently, I was inspired by an old high school friend to keep applying to tech jobs and that I can do something. I have a few coding projects in the pipeline, some previous work to show, but am still piecing together the masterpieces.

**In essence...**

I am wondering if there is anybody I could talk to or have as a mentor to help place me on the right track to get a remote development job. I am willing to sign a legally binding contract that gives you a return on your investment (% of my paycheck each month for a year or more) if your help results in job placement. I am serious.

It was nice. But now the woman I love is gone and I'm unfit to be a dad alone. I'm also an artist! And a boxer!

he is taking multiple muscle relaxers a day, can’t stand to be sober, won’t admit that he’s addicted, gets mad whenever i try to help. i love this man more than anything and i’m so scared. genuinely i’ve put my everything into helping him and if he, of all the people on this earth, can’t be helped, can i even be helped? this is the thought going thru my head. if i fucking killed myself i wouldn’t have to deal with any of it. i know ppl are gonna suggest breaking up but honestly i would rather kill myself. i love this man more than anything else ever.

if anyones got advice from experience would be greatly appreciated.",bf-is-addicted,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/whd2gh/my_boyfriend_is_an_addict_and_im_scared/
Suicidal thoughts engulfing me like flames. I've never felt more alone in this world.,emptypost,Stackmybread23,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/whf7n3/suicidal_thoughts_engulfing_me_like_flames_ive/
i (f) think my mom was being inconsiderate for having me,"yes, title. don't get me wrong, i absolutely love my mom and i know she really does try her best but i just don't think there's a point. 

so it's 2am in the morning and I'm just thinking about how odd my mother is. quite odd and quite different from me. see, my mother has gone through ALLOT and by allot i mean surviving a genocide and witnessing so many deaths at the age of around 14 and having to separate from her family to a different country at the same age. now i won't lie, her hard work already paid off. she apparently had the best time of her life around her 20s although fighting other battles on her own behind the scenes. And since she had nobody to guide her or advise her during that time, loneliness took a toll on her mental health. then a couple years later, she had me. at the age of 29.( other things have happened but i really will just spare you the details.)

now, what get's me thinking and questioning is..what person would go through all of that and decide to have a goddamn baby?? to me it's either A, she was pushed or felt pressured to have one or B, she just wanted one. and B being the most likely i still don't get it. why would you want one after going through the worst in this world? 

 i know i have to be one of the decisions she regrets making. i just have to be. she has mentioned regretting me once in the car but she later said that she was angry and didn't mean it which i understand can happen but come on, really? i think it's inconsiderate and illogical for you to go through that and be like ""hey, i want a baby!"" and woah! what a shocker, the man she had the baby with ended up being an abusive loser and left. 

i really am willing to take my life because i feel like it would make her life easier and i, will not have to live on this horrible planet. a win win.

"I wish that we just died and nothing, no afterlife, no soul or anything else.","My faith is the only reason I stay in this unending torment, or more so the fear I have because of it. The thought of an eternal existence even after death torments me, I'm afraid to kill myself because I'm afraid that I'll still exist in some form or another.

I don't want heaven, I certainly don't want hell. I don't want to be reincarnated, I don't want to be left wandering as a spirit still trapped in this curse of a world. I love God with all my heart and would find it impossible to not believe in Him.

Still though... there's that part of me that wishes nothing was true. The thought of dying and that being the final end of my existence would be the greatest comfort I could imagine. If I had no faith, then I would have no reason to keep existing in misery. The world and life would be truly meaningless and I'd know that I have no purpose in it.

I pray for death and beg Him to end this, I don't think He's going to though. I exist only for Him and have given up on everything else. Let Him do with me as He pleases, I hope He will show me mercy and wipe me out of existence entirely. I wish I could just do it myself now more than ever, but I know that wouldn't be the end.

I still question if I should just take my chances though, every waking moment I think about suicide. I'm dead inside already, I just want it to end.",Dead-and-Broken,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/whemen/i_wish_that_we_just_died_and_nothing_no_afterlife/

It’s pathetic I’m an adult at this point I should be able to do all this but for some reason I just can’t. All I’m doing in life right now is laying around all day and leeching off my parents like a parasite, and before one I know they’re going to get rid of me and rightfully so.

Suicidal thoughts due to Helicopter Parents,"I am a 19 Y M and come from a ultra conservative religious family with my parents and relatives bent on to practice each and everything that is written in the book.As far as I remember, they keep pushing me to follow their belief system and indoctrinated me..it’s only when i turned 15 I started questioning their beliefs . I identify myself as an agnostic but I know i can’t live as i desire…they are always checking what I am doing etc etc. Even though my college is 4 hrs drive from their place, they frequently visit just to supervise me. I’m genuinely sick of this behaviour. I can’t go out with friends, party and even talk to girls because those are ‘bad’ things which will pull me away from religion. My plan earlier was to go and settle abroad after college to escape such shitty behaviour but as I know my parents will be reluctant to send me and even if I go they will keep an eye on me all the time. As arranged marriages are a norm here they will force me to marry a girl which matches their belief system and so practically I can never be on my own. I feel trapped in a cage. 

Don’t get me wrong my parents have always been my only support over these years when I was bullied in school and came crying home, when I was diagnosed with a congenital lung disease 3 years ago they took care of me for a whole year, got me operated from a well known thoracic surgeon and payed a hefty bill. 

I feel down all day due to this, thought of committing suicide several times by jumping from the terrace but still can’t gather courage to do it just for the thought of my parents, I am their only son and I can’t stand them suffering and weeping all their life.",Suicidal0008,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgz45u/suicidal_thoughts_due_to_helicopter_parents/

I finally lost the last tether,"I'm not going to get into too much detail, but I've now fucked up my life beyond recovery. And then, after 11 months of struggle, my final tether keeping me here finally snapped. I want to write something revolutionary, something poignant, so people somewhat remember my existence. I also regret that I have nothing to leave behind, but honestly, all in all, it's probably for the best. I'm altogether unremarkable, incredibly self destructive, and I never fail to just fuck people up emotionally without even trying to. I only wanted to do right by others, but being me, neurodivergent, severely mentally ill, I never understood what the right thing was. Until now. (Though, to be fair, I did know earlier, I just refused to accept it)  
I've known for a while now that I was going to die tragically young. And it feels weird now that it's about to happen. I'm feeling peaceful, relieved. But also scared. I know it's my final fuckup. But I fear the effect this will have on the people who have, unfortunately for themselves, grown an attachment to me.   
My tether banned me from leaving my room for the next 10 hours. I know though, as soon as the time is up, this would be it. It'll be over. I'll just be a statistic, a sob story, a memory. Someone who could have been something, if they actually put effort into anything. But all that would be meaningless. I'll finally be lost to time.  
I won't even be able to say goodbye to my friends, not after last time. And it makes me feel horrible. They deserve better. They all deserved better.

Where do i draw the line to get help?,"Ive been depressed on and off for 3 years with anxiety issues this past year. Ive always been a little suicidal/ dabbled in SH.

I think I'm ready to go,"If this is what the rest of my life is going to be like that I don't want it. My ex destroyed my life because I got sick of her taking her anger out on me and I tried to break up with her. And in return she told lies about me to everybody I used to know, telling them that I cheated on her. Everybody believed it and so they all left even my family disowned me. I've got no one. When I was in the hospital for an asthma attack about a month ago they asked me about emergency contacts and I didn't have anyone's name I could put there. Not a soul. I'm very sick now, my medication (effexor) that my doctor makes me take that I can't go off of without seriously risky side effects is making me very sick. I have diarrhea every day to the point where I bleed and everything I eat I throw up even water. I'm constantly dehydrated and I've had these symptoms along with a pounding headache for about 2 weeks and if I do in fact die my body is just going to rot in this apartment because no one's going to be wondering where I'm at. My corpse will probably be left in here for months since I've got my bills on autopay. Considering how shitty maintenance is around here they're probably not even going to do anything when it starts to smell.

All I ever wanted from life was companionship. Everybody I've ever met like me said that eventually they just gave up and we're happy with the fact that they would always be alone but I don't know how to do that. They say it's because that I seek validation from an outside source but that's not even it. I'm just very very alone. No one can imagine the level of alone that I am. I am the most isolated person on Earth. I was born to a couple of stupid hillbillies who didn't want a second child and because they had me late in life I was born with scoliosis. We were one of those old fashioned families who doesn't really bother trying to fix sickly family members, we just shut them away in the house and forget about them. I wasn't allowed to go to public school, I was homeschooled. Kept away from the other children because my parents were ashamed of me. And I was too weak to play with them anyway. My entire life was just spent watching the world go by and never being able to take part in it. On the outside looking in, shut away from everyone. It was like there was a whole world out there but I was stuck in this stupid little fucking bubble that I wasn't allowed to exit. It almost felt like this lifetime is one big nasty timeout session. Where I get placed in the corner and I get to watch everybody else have fun and make friends with each other and I don't get to be a part of it.

I want more than anything to connect with someone anyone. A real connection, shallow friendship isn't enough but I'll never have that. I don't know how I live this life anymore. It's been years since anyone has touched me in any way other than to hit me. I haven't been hugged since my ex ruined my reputation and I don't think I ever will be again. And that's all I want is just a fucking God damn hug which I will never get! After the things she said about me no one would fucking hug me. No one would even sit down with me and watch a fucking movie or have a drink with me. I could pay someone a $100 and they still wouldn't play with me. Everybody looks at me like I'm a goddamn monster and I just can't take it anymore. So I'm here. Waiting for someone to give me the benefit of the doubt. Listening ear that I will never find. A hug that will never come and I'm just about ready to put myself out of my fucking misery. I hope to God the side effects of this medication kill me. And if they don't I'll finish the job myself I'm sick of this.

I'm sick of my stupid solitary confinement sentence especially since it's for something I didn't even fucking do. All of this isolation. Just because I was born physically deformed. And just because I didn't want a certain girl taking her anger out on me anymore. I'm done.

I need her right now. I know how selfish it is, but I wish she would just go back to wanting me because I need her. Im probably pregnant. I have nobody else who would be able to understand. Nobody.

I’m so tired,"Man another rant. I read endless posts about shit like this. I guess there’s no use in really wanting to take anyone with me when I die. I honestly don’t see a use, if the world is so good, then why has it never showed itself. Sure you have to work for it but when not a shred of light is visible in this damned reality then what’s the point? Death is like the time before birth. There’s nothing. No heaven. No hell. Just nothing. It’s like your consciousness never existed. I’m ashamed but I fucking crave it I just want to not have consciousness I hate every damn minute of this, the only distractions I have are damn birds that will never understand me, and some stupid shit on the internet. I spend my life so far fucking staring at a screen or staring at birds that never even notice me, getting comfort more from these birds than any human ever has. 

Even if there was something destined for my future I don’t even wanna see it. There’s no point being optimistic. This reality is just a facade of ‘happiness’ all we do is fucking wake up eat work eat sleep. We spend hours doing stupid shit and sleeping or working. After years of that shit you just eventually die. Even if you did get your dream home and a good family then still whats it for, why do we even deserve it. It’s like nobody understand it, they just say oh there’s something in your life waiting for you ohh fucking no there’s not and even if there was theres no use waiting for it. 

The population always votes against the best things. So why should death be considered bad. Everything that’s hated, usually is actually good. We have thousands of stupid campaigns against suicide, but none voting for it. People seriously don’t want me to be at peace, to be dead. They’d rather fucking keep me on this damn earth suffering every second thinking of how much of a fucking ‘savior’ they are. That damn hospital kept me for TWO FUCKING MONTHS AND DIDNT GIVE A SHIT HOW TRAUMATIZING IT WAS, KEEPING ME FUCKING SEPERATED FROM MY FAMILY, DESPITE KNOWING I HAD INTENSE PREVIOUS TRAUMA RELATING TO ABANDONMENT. THEY SAW HOW FUCKING MUCH OF AN IMPACT IT HAD ON ME, HAVING FUCKING PANIC ATTACKS EVERY HOUR, IN THE FUCKING KNEE POSITION ROCKING IN THE CORNER, CRYING SO MUCH THERES NO TEARS LEFT. NOT EVEN ABLE TO TALK, OR EAT, FUCKING REVERTING BACK TO BASIC HUMAN INSTINCTS. THEY FUCKING LAUGHED WHEN I COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AFTER WITNESSING ANOTHER PATIENT HEAVILY INJURE SEVERAL STAFF. THEY DIDNT GIVE A SHIT I FELT UNSAFE AND MADE ME HAVE A ROOM NEAR THAT FUCKING GUY.

I've been living with this for years and I feel like im running out of time. I can't be happy.

and after everything that happened I'm right back where I was.,"I didn't have friends growing up until about 8th grade. I got lucky because some girl that had a crush on me invited me to come watch doctor strange with her and her friends. 

Time passed and I joined her friend group and I guess I just got lucky to have that opportunity.

I fucked up a lot as a friend, but I kept learning and trying and learning and trying, and I started to feel happy, but for some reason it all slipped away, in one moment.

This isn't something I could've changed, we grew apart, but nobody ever gave me a warning, they just grew more distant from me and eventually admitted to it when I asked if they were tired of being friends with me. I worked my ass off and in the end it all slipped away. 

I can't be mad at them, I'm not their responsibility, but it's just sick. One day you've got a life and the next day you don't. Maybe you saw it slipping away but nobody told you a thing until it was too late, and now I'm right where I started. 

Nothing is fun. Nothing makes me happy. I'm out of friends and no matter how hard I try I can't make any more, but it's worse now.

Now I've spent a couple years on drugs and in therapy to fix myself, I've put so much goddamned work in to make things right, to make myself a better man, and here I am, still like this. After all this time, I still can't fight this urge. I still struggle to get up and find a reason to live. A reason to work. A reason to try.

I've got nothing to live for, nothing to die for, nothing to gain, and nothing to lose.

This is barely half of it really....,"When I was about 1 year old, my dad stabbed my mom in the stomach with a knife. She didn't die from it physically. Mentally she slipped away and became an alcoholic. I grew up in a foster family. They were only in it for the money and they were mentally abusive to me every day. I felt horrible, misunderstood, worthless, a burden. The worst was the contrast I got from their beloved grandchildren. They got everything they wanted, while I was left with nothing. I felt like Harry Potter but without the magic. I have always had trouble making friends. The few friends I had was even harder to keep. I still struggle with this today and recently I lost a big friend group due to a few bad apples in the bunch. When I was 16 I discovered that my foster mom were having an affair with a family friend. Her phone had been ringing while I was home alone and I saw 10 missed calls from him. They were out eating dinner somewhere together (My foster parents, the family friend and his wife) I got curious about what had happened and started reading her texts. They were all from him about how he loved her and when they should meet again and shit like that. They had always held me to such a high moral standard. I could never do the slightest mistake, and if I did, they would berate me and make me feel like shit for weeks. So I confronted my foster mom with her affair a few days after that. She straight up denied it and told me I was a useless piece of shit that nobody would believe. I eventually showed my foster moms phone and the messages to my foster parents daughter and told her what had happened. She read the messages and told me that she would handle it.

A few days later I am in their car, heading for a kind of halfway house for troubled teens with nowhere else to live. They dropped me off with a few of my belongings and I assume they sold the rest of my things. For the second time in my life I was ripped away from everything I had known, Everyone I knew and this time I was on my own. I buried my feelings as deep as I could. Walled off the sadness and thought I could forget about it. Until one day I just exploded. I was in the middle of a classroom when I just started crying. I couldn't  stop and I had to be taken to a  acute  psychiatric hospital for a talk with 2 doctors. They listened to my life story and just told me that they had encountered people whom had been through less than me, but were on hard drugs to cope. They congratulated me on not doing Heroin and sent me on my way.

I am 32 years old and still live in that city. I have never had a job. I don't have any friends. and I just sit in a one room flat all day, staring at my laptop screen. YouTube videos, Netflix shows, HBO. And once a week I go shopping for easy to make food, Frozen pizzas and microwave dinners. I just keep myself alive. When I'm hungry I eat. When I'm tired I sleep.

But I see no reason to keep myself alive anymore. I contribute nothing to society. I didn't finish school due to the move. And I have no future. The few romantic relationships I've had, ended because I'm just a hopeless loser with no life. 

I have had so many hobbies in my life. I cant even remember half of them. Anything to take my mind off the shitty thoughts. The only hobby that I stuck with was playing guitar. But lately I don't even want to do that. I feel like a ghost. So why not become one?

My last girlfriend broke up with me and my mind broke. I was Hospitalized in a mental institution with suicidal thoughts. My lowest point there led me to a suicide attempt. I hung myself with a belt. Everything turned black. The staff pulled me down on the floor and revived me. When I came to, I couldn't see. It felt like when your leg falls asleep but all over my body. I was confused and had no memory of what had happened.

2 years later I sit here in my tiny flat (that I don't clean) Half my stuff is still in moving boxes from when I thought I would get evicted. and the other half of my stuff is scattered around the floor along with piles of trash and dust. When my Girlfriend left me I drank a lot of alcohol and played loud music to drown out all the shit again. That's when my neighbor knocked on my door and attacked me with a stun gun. The following days I spent in bed terrified. Then I got a notice that I was getting sued by the same neighbor for violence against him. He also had a bullshit witness that backed up his bullshit story and I lost the case. Almost got evicted from my ""home"" because of that but I ended up not going to prison. I just had to stay off alcohol for a year and have weekly consultations with a police officer instead.

I hate life and being alive. And I have decided not to stay. The only thing I like to do is to sit in the sun with a joint. But I cant get drugs where I live anymore.

I feel like I have no future. I am just drowning every day. I go to sleep and wish I don't wake up every day. I am a hollow shadow of a person-shaped piece of shit and my life cant get better. The prices of everything keeps going up, Cigarettes, food, anything really.

I think I will end my life soon. I can feel it in my bones. This world is not for me.

I just need to get this out.,"Please read the whole story before judging. 

I really should look into getting therapy but I just need to get this off my chest somewhere where no one knows me or my husband and might understand a little of what it’s like. Or just tell me I’m a terrible person idk. 

The last several years my husband has been overly depressed and he has been on antidepressants almost his whole life (He’s almost 40). He’s THE biggest pessimist I have ever met and it has gotten so bad over the last couple of years. The world is out to get him, no one likes him, every job sucks and everyone sucks. Nothing is good enough for him. All he talks about is killing himself. For days over the last several years I have been there. I have talked him off the ledges. I suggest therapy, I suggest the suicide hotline. He has a pessimistic excuse for all of it. ‘They just tell me I’m lying and to get over it and hang up on me’ or ‘they will change all my medicine and make me start over bc we moved and I have to find a new one’. I can’t say anything right anymore. Everything I say now is making it worse or means I don’t care. But my god. At what point do you just get fed up and tired and depressed yourself after dealing with this for so many years and just want to stop trying to talk him off the ledge and see if he would even go through with it? He wouldn’t. It’s all cry wolf. But I’m the bad guy for not trying to stop him so now there’s a new issue. He can’t keep a job bc they all suck and everyone hates him and makes his job harder. He stresses out over the smallest things and makes himself sick over it. There’s no jobs out there for him so he just has to stay miserable (his words) even though literally everyone is hiring. Now I’m on antidepressants and have been distancing myself from family and cut off friends because I just feel so mentally exhausted from dealing with this every day over the last several years. Everything is getting blamed on me (our finances, his depression, etc). I’ve learned not to speak back and to just nod or ignore it because it just makes things worse. I walk on egg shells. We’ve been together 14+ years and it has never been so bad. It’s just been over the last 4-5 years and I just don’t know how much more I can take. I attempted suicide when I was 13. I was being bullied at school. I took 16 Tylenol pills. I started throwing up and got scared and told my parents what I did. I was rushed to the ER and had to drink charcoal and be in the suicide watch room for a few days which is just a glass room with a bed. In a hospital. How embarrassing. Then I had out patient group therapy for a week. My parents couldn’t afford long term therapy and my mom wouldn’t allow me to take antidepressants (please don’t judge or comment on this. I’m past that). But I’m on antidepressants now and they worked at first. But now I guess with everything going on.. I just feel like I’m going back into my hole and want to drive off a cliff. Which shouldn’t be too hard bc I live in the mountains. I just need to get this off my chest. My family would just say it’s all in my head. Just try to be happy. Go outside. My husband would say join the club. Can’t blame him there. And I think I’m too afraid to go to a therapist. I think I’m too afraid of what I would learn about myself. And what they say needs to happen in my life to fix things. Plus there’s money that I don’t exactly have falling off trees. The funny thing is that I was just planning a ten year wedding anniversary photo shoot for me and my husband bc the SD card for our wedding photos some how malfunctioned while taking our pictures. So all we have are a couple cell phone pictures people took. Anyway. Today I’m considering living life alone and how much I would enjoy it and how much happier I would likely be and since he always says he’s so miserable here then I would just tell him to go back to his parents. Bc it’s obviously my fault for moving us out of state for a new life and new opportunities bc he definitely wasn’t miserable before we left where we were. 🙄 idk. I just want to give up so bad. I’m tired of fighting this fight. But at the same time no one else will fight it for him and maybe I should just grin and bare it and continue to support him and push therapy harder. I’ll probably delete this post in 12 hours or so to make sure it’s never seen.

Ive had no success with women, still a virgin, I have no friends, and I have no reason to live. My sister is having me walk her down the aisle this month, after maybe 6 months I'll kill myself, so it's not too soon after her wedding.

I tried to go back to school today but I don't think I'm strong enough.,"This summer has been a summer from hell. 

on June 12 of 2021, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. he had always been a smoker and had been doing so since he was 14 years old. 

My mom has been the sole caregiver for him and she has nothing left in her tank, not for me, not for my dad, not for my siblings, not for anyone. My grandfather died on July 14, 2022 at the age of 65. 

now that he has passed, we have been doing our best to go back to normal but unfortunately i have used food as comfort for the past several months. constant binge eating and feeling bad but then doing it again. I have gained 20 pounds in 13 months, all of it in fat.

&amp;#x200B;

today I tried to go back to school and was immediately greeted with a ""what the fuck happened to you"" when my teammates saw me. my world fell apart. I have been broken down so many times this past year and to hear my teammates ask what happened, where I have been, if I still even want to play basketball anymore has made me think more and more about suicide than before. 

If I stick with basketball and life as a whole, the recovery process will be shit personified and I don't know if I'm strong enough.

I fucking hate my life!,"I really fucking hate my life. I have always wanted to die since I was a little little girl. I keep thinking that life can’t get any worse for me and to be sure I can make some changes and things will get better and so I do and things always end up inevitably worse. So all I’ve ever wanted in life is to be a mother and a wife and I’m neither of those anymore, so what the fuck am I supposed to do now? I honestly don’t give a fuck about myself and I have no hopes and aspirations in life beyond being a mother and wife. I mean I’m not even living in the right century. Women are supposed to cook and clean and keep them mouth shut and do other than hold. That is not however it ever should’ve been and that’s all I’ve ever known. I don’t have any idea about life outside of the very close knit way I grew up. So you know it’s time to be proactive and research it and figure it out. Got to be resilient, right? Got to find life beyond being a wife and mother. Life beyond taking care of everyone nonstop. I type into Google what to do with your life when you are no longer a mother and all that comes up is pages and pages of people who do not want to be mothers anymore and God damn that’s all I want. It’s just infuriating. I’m pretty much alone in the world I don’t even know why I’m posting this shit. I guess I just feels like I’m talking to someone. I don’t know.

i hate my life and its my fault but damn do i hate my parents,"ive been a failure for a while. had to take a break from college because my anxiety got too high. ive been privileged enough to not have a job to support myself- not to entirely blame my anxiety again but that's also part of the reason.

ive always felt like my parents babied me throughout my life. im forever grateful for their support but im so sick of living man. everyday i have to live with the fact that i cant drive, i dont have a job, im out of college, and i ghosted all my friends.

i just now had a really big fight with my family. which motivated me even more to write all what ive been holding in on here. fuck i hate that my parents gave birth to me. there is not one day where i dont contemplate living. 

i hate how i look. im short af, my acne wont go away, im not strong, i need glasses everywhere i go, my teeth are cavity prone, and if you couldnt tell im extremely insecure. why do my parents have such horrible genetics.

i recognize abt how horrible of a person ive become and i just want to leave forever. i want my parents to feel the guilt that their daughter killed herself because of them one day. i want them to suffer and think about how horrible parents theyve become. they raised someone so heartless and sadistic. its a shame that i had hope for them.

i wished they raised someone who didnt have crippling anxiety. i cant do anything- school, relationships, driver's license. i cant even bring myself to end my own life. 

if only there was an accessible painless way to die. really struggling out here but if there r any ideas i would seriously appreciate it. too scared of a painful death.

My ex got tired of me and recently told me to kill myself over text and I think the newest cherry on top is about 10 minutes ago my sister came into my room and started telling me I won't amount to anything in life and only old 40 year old men would want me, she has made fun of me for my abortion in the past and having sex with guys outside of my own race.

I was planning (in depth) how to end it all back then anyhow, so this was kind of little a little “bonus run” on life. 

I’m in my 40s. I had been extremely unhappy in my marriage for a good number of years. She just made my life miserable. She was spoiled, ungrateful, manipulative, overbearing and I felt like a man-servant/prisoner. For years I just told myself that I would wait until the kids went off to college and then split. Simple plan on paper. As the years and months went by tho, I just couldn’t see myself making it that long. I was planning out accidents. Places where I could lose control of my car. Staircases that could most likely get the job done. Something that insurance wouldn’t contest. 

I snapped and said nope tho. I left. I told my wife I couldn’t take it anymore. I told her I didn’t love her and I left. I figured I would just give this a chance first, right?

Things are just hard. Really hard. It’s been almost 3 years now since I left. I see her all the time. She texts me all the time and for the most part it’s been cordial. I mean, there were obviously horrible moments - especially in the beginning. I see my daughters at least 5 times a week. 

I started dating someone 8 months ago and she found out two weeks ago. It’s been really hard since. I get walls of texts about how much I am hurting the girls and how I’m a terrible sick human. 

I never thought I would be back in a state of mind where I thought I could go through with it, but it’s so tempting. I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up. I wish I could just go away and everyone would forget about me. 

I’m desperately trying to find a psychiatrist for an in person session, but everything is virtual and it’s just not going to get through to me in the same way. 

I feel like rock bottom is right around the corner. I’m so sorry for being like this and for causing so much pain in the lives of others.",wishfulrestart,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/whcjsf/feel_like_im_reaching_the_end_of_my_line/
"Just a vent, nothing more then that.","Its so tiresome when you have suicidal thoughts every day.

I Can't Deal,"My parents absolutely abhor one another, and I tried to explain it to them, knowing full well how it was going to turn out. And then I try to explain something so simple to my mom and she doesn't understand. This is my life: I explain things over and over and over again, and nobody gets it or believes me. The only logical reason for it is because I'm a kid, and nobody believes a kid. Even if I explain it at a kindergarten level, nobody understands. 

My whole life, people write off what I have to say as unimportant and wrong, when its been shown, time and time again, that I'm right. And even when I show people that, they still say I'm wrong. And I can't do this anymore. Nothing helps. I've been sent away to program after program after program and I really don't see the point in living. I can't do it anymore. I give up.

well, not until /now./ i'm not writing this and then going to kick the can immediately after. 

but soon.

you'd think i wouldn't be so certain. especially since i've never actually tried to do it. but i think at this point, it's do or die. 

well. not precisely do or die, since doing is also dying, but

you know what i mean. end of the line and all that shit. 

i've written so many suicide notes in the past. some for a general audience, some addressed to a specific person. i think part of the reason i didn't end up sending them was because they weren't right. whatever that means. 

at this point though, i don't think there /is/ a right. there's no optimal way to end this. i'm not going to think of the perfect thing to say. i'm not going to feel a magical moment of calm washing over me or whatever the fuck. shit doesn't work like that, at least not for me.

I have very few friends or people I can talk about anything with, most of which being online (too afraid to leave the house to hang out).

The Doomsday clock is set.,"Hello Redditors, first and hopefully only time I rely on a place like this.
Life story has enough content to write a series of books, but I'm not really going to file every wrong the world inflicted on me. 
Just know I have no family to fall back on, (don't even know the name of a single grandparent or cousin dead or alive). 
I've lost everything that mattered to me.
I've been homeless, and I have been isolated from any valuable personal interactions for 6 years, minus speaking to useless psychiatrists which should've counted for something but in the end that and all the different medications I've been on never solved anything. 
Told myself if my life was still going downhill after 5 years I'd end it, but I failed. 
It wasn't my first attempt. First time I was only 12 and leapt 30 feet onto concrete trying to go head first. 

Now I've scheduled a time and place. Until that time hits, I'll keep fighting and trying. I already suffer so what is more suffering going to do, end me quicker? Sounds good to me.
I've already done the self loathing on my ass until i lost my home. 
I got no one who cares for me and no one who will miss me. (I mean this literally. If such a person existed they haven't told me the past 6 years minimum.)
This final struggle is for me, fuck you world.

In the end why did I post this here?
Maybe so someone can relate, or maybe I'm just a human craving some interaction with likeminded people myself. 
But even that makes no sense to me the more I think about it...

Tired,"I'm really tired. It's been a long time since I've felt like this but with my busy school schedule timetable, and my struggle to find a part-time job, I've been feeling sucidical again.

But guess what, I'm 6 months in, haven't gone to therapy, and I'm feeling sucidical again. Thus, I promised myself that if my mental health didn't get any better that I would kill myself on my 19th birthday.

ive never felt so alone,"this is my second time posting on here recently. i needed to get more off of my chest. my life in the moment doesn't look good. im very young and it seems since i am that i think super irrational about everything, and once i get older things will change. but honestly from what im looking at, things won't change. every time i turn around or recovery from a traumatic event, something else happens. the most recent one was my step dad passing away, the man i considered my father. he would've done anything to see me happy and now he's gone. my mom got strung out and left, leaving just my brother and i to fend for ourselves. 

luckily, we have an amazing grandmother that gave us our own place to live. but my relationship with both of them is bad. my grandma pushed me into starving myself, and my brother sexually assaulted me when i was younger. 

my grandmother consistently shames me, and only me (she body shames both of us, but she only shames me about everything else). my brother has always been her favorite. it never really bothered me until she started invalidating how i felt because of him. every time we argue, its always my fault. everything is always on me. i have to be the strong one. i have to be the one to face our abusive mom when the time comes, because apparently i handle it. i can't, i just don't show emotion enough for anyone to realize how much im on the verge of suicide. every time we argue, it's always ""x can't handle it."" even though, i just got out of a mental hospital for attempted suicide. my brother has every opportunity to speak his mind, but i can't. even though, all he does is tell me how bad of a person i am all of the time. when the only reason im so agitated is because i can't sleep or eat. but apparently that makes me like my abusive mother, according to my brother. 

earlier i went with my grandma to go pick up my brother and i had just taken 10 benadryls so i was very tired, out of it, and agitated. he asked me if i didn't something to my hair, to which i replied with ""mhm."" when he didn't hear me i responded rudely, ""i said yeah."" which started an argument. he told me i was like my abusive mom, like he always does. my grandma took me to my mom's house (i was staying with my grandma until i could move into our new apartment) because they blamed me for the entire thing. which i know seems so miniscule, but ive been barely keeping it together as it is. my grandnma has always hated me since i was a kid. ive always been the one in the wrong. she never looked at me and thought this kid just needs someone to love them, she always just hated me. and she says she doesn't, but she makes it very obvious who her favorites are. 

it hurts because i just want someone to love me. 

and even before that, i tried to confide in my friend about being suicidal. they responded with ""uh damn, anyways im playing a video game."" they usually are pretty helpful and i know they are okay with me sharing these kinds of things with them, so this hurt. they've been so different lately and i know it's because both of us are barely hanging on. but after the most recent times they've genuinely hurt my feelings, i don't trust them anymore. talking to them doesn't feel the same. they were my one and only. they were my safe space. but now thats gone too. 

these things seem so small, but i don't know if i could ever put into words how im feeling right now. sure, my life has been full of trauma. but im tired of blaming everything on what happened to me. i don't need to talk about it anymore, i just need to feel okay. but after all of it and seeing the person ive become, im not sure thats even possible. ive been struggling with my mental health for so long and it's only gotten worse. i don't think i can do this much longer. i have no one to turn to anymore. ive genuinely never felt this alone. i feel so empty and im so tired of the mood swings every day. im so tired of the 3 hour breakdowns i have every day. im tired of becoming irrationally angry and ruining things for myself. im tired of not being able to sleep, or eat. im tired of constantly trying to fill the void with drugs, sex, alcohol, and people that i know will never be able to love me. im tired of burdening the people around me. everyone has made it pretty clear how much they dont love me, how much i burden them. i have nothing left here anymore. whenever i look around and see how many people hurt me or people ive ruined thngs with, i realize that im just a monster. everyone will be better off if i wasnt here anymore. i planned to kill myself on my birthday in 10 days, i think i might actually go through with it. 

anyways, i really needed to let all of that out. thanks for listening.",Prudent-Performer1,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgsull/ive_never_felt_so_alone/

We don't talk about it. It just makes the pain that much worse.

oh boy where do i start? well first my parents are in the middle of a split, my dads a cheater and he’s mad mom caught him, but we still live with dad since mom couldn’t afford to leave (when we had my brother a couple years ago they made an agreement she stays home and dad makes the money) my brother is special needs so he needs more of moms time and his birth was the start of my depression. the past couple years my feelings have been invalidated since he’s a baby my feelings basically don’t matter, nor do my mental issues since he’s the special needs one. my dad isn’t really present, he’s busy “working” all the time and never really seems to try to actually listen to me, and he thinks money can replace the lack of a dad. when i started freshman year of highschool i met this girl who was like, just my type, we got along so well, then she dumped me right before my birthday, it’s been half a year and i’m still heartbroken. she’s also my best friend, i try to be there for her in her times wher she feels suicidal, and i give her as much effort as i possibly can, sometimes it feels unnoticed, and that she doesn’t really try much with me. i was manipulated by a guy who took advantage of my broken heart to do physical things with me, then ditched me when i didn’t give him that. when i tried opening up to friends they made a joke out of it, i cut them off and told them how that made me feel and they blamed me for it, since they are also friends with that guy. schools starts this monday and i’m freaking out becuase i won’t see my best friend as much because she will be busy with the kids in her main class and i’m worried she will like them better than me and we grow apart, the people in my main class don’t like me and are extremely fake. the cherry on top is that there’s a girl who’s obsessed with me and trying to tarnish my name or whatever. she has threatened me multiple times and is calling me racist and an islamaphobe which doesn’t make sense since i’m mixed and a former muslim. i’m extremely close to killing myself before school starts just so i can’t go. i hate both online and in person school. i’m surrounded by people who make me feel like shit, and i can’t drop out either. i don’t see a way out of this since all my happiness lied with my best friend when we were dating and all i want her love and comfort but she doesn’t like me anymore so i’m just sitting here, wishing i wasn’t here at all. maybe if i were to die my dad and all the school people will truly realize how much damage they’ve caused. only person id feel bad for is my best friend, if she truly cares that is.",OutdatedFeelings,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgprzb/i_dont_know_if_ill_make_it_to_monday/

I don't know who else to ask,"My (f19) boyfriend (m21) had his best friend kill herself around 6 years ago (I'm not sure exactly how long ago because he rarely talks about it). To make matters even harder for him he walked in on her which has really had an effect on him. The day she decided to attempt she told my boyfriend about how she was struggling and that evening she sadly went through with her attempt. This is what has caused him major issues. He feels like he didn't respond to her cry for help, just telling her that ""things will hopefully work out"". He thinks that if he had acted differently in that moment she might still be here today, and is filled with guilt everyday. He normally only speaks about this when he is incredibly drunk, so I never get to hear about it when he's sober and able to be reasoned with. 

I always try to comfort him for example by saying he was only a teen when she decided to confide in him and therefore wasn't equipped with the knowledge he needed to save her, or that by the time she told him her feelings she had unfortunately already made up her mind, but nothing seems to help him.

I know that there is no fix for this but I was just wondering if anyone had any advice to help him feel less guilty. Do I ask him about it when he's sober? Is there anything that I can recommend to him to start the healing process?",Chuggtogether,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/whaw94/i_dont_know_who_else_to_ask/

"I've always loved music, today i wrote a song about my suicidal feelings","these are the lyrics, there will probably be a lot of mistakes but oh well: 

  

This song won’t write itself 

But I have no energy to write it 

This feelings won’t deal with themselves 

But I have no will to deal with them 

I’m so spent 

I’ve become so spent

I wake up every morning 

I wish I could sleep for longer 

I go to bed everynight 

Wish I wasn’t a feeling monger 

Don’t wake me up 

Please don’t wake me up 

Swimming in the sea 

Am I swimming or am I floating 

Floating in this sea 

Am I floating or am I drowning 

I can’t tell, I can no longer tell 

No one made me wax wings 

I could never reach the sun to melt them 

And all these broken parts 

I know I will never mend them 

And the home that I never found 

I’ll find in your memories 

First just let me go 

To the place where no home is 

I’ll be no longer struggling 

I’ll be no longer drowning 

In far away land, in far away land 

You’ve done nothing wrong 

But Just let me go 

You’ve said nothing wrong 

But I’ve got to go

"Don’t want to die, don’t see how to avoid it","I hurt my back a while ago. I’ve been maxed out on my painkiller dosage for five years. Shockingly it has finally stopped working. I feel like I’m being torn in half. I’m up to 30mg of oxycodone in the last half hour and it’s already beyond the point where it causes intense nausea. I haven’t eaten or drank anything for three days. 

I’m scared. 

If it hurts this much through the pills, I’m terrified of what’s going to happen when I inevitably run out early. I’ve done everything. Physio, ablation, ice, heat, shots, muscle relaxers, yoga.. I’m out of options. 

I feel like now I’m pressed to make a decision as to whether to end it here or risk running out and not being able to end things anymore. 

My head is spinning and I can’t think straight from pain. I don’t want to die but i can barely breathe it’s so intense. 

I knew the oxy would stop working one day, and it’s here, and I’m not ready, I’m scared.

i dont kno.w why but i decided to reach out to some people from my past and i was excited it seemed to be going well until of course it didn't last. good things do not last for me. i shouldnt have done it. this person is using me as a replacement for someone else much more important to them and it made me spiral. i dont hold worth. none of my words hold anything special to anybody my voice is garbage to everyone around me. i wish i had the guts to tell them i want to be listened to as well, to be asked about my life and my thoughts. i dont think anyone cares about me in that way. on this day, after realising why they were talking to me, my mind was plagued with self hatred. why is every decision i make the bad one? why did i ever reach out to anyone when im perfectly ok alone? i cried so much. i cried and cried and the people i live with never know i cry because i dont want to be a nuisance. but i couldnt hold it in. my pain leaked outside of me and it was the biggest mistake i could have made. my parent was upset with me for not telling them about a meeting i was having, i was going to tell them but my sibling did it before i had the chance to. after i calmed down a little i was going to. it led my parent to believe i was never going to tell them. i was already so deep into my breakdown i ended up raising my voice a little. i have avery quiet voice so it probably sounded the same to them. they didnt care about what i had to say. they told me they would throw away my food if i didnt go get it and i cried while eating it. i have not been hungry since. the situation made me feel like i was 15 again, like my whole existence was a mistake. i remembered that just because i am an adult now, doesnt mean they love me, it just means they can no longer abuse me like they used to. they have been ignoring me since then and its extremely triggering (sorry for using this word). i have never felt so alone. they saw me crying and threatened to throw away my food. i wish i was dead. my other parent, when i first came to them about being suicidal, told me suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. i have never told them about my tendencies again. 10 years later, i am still suicidal, i still feel alone. i hate myself for opening the floodgates. i hate myself for thinking i could ever get better or have hope. i want to curse everyone out and punch walls until my fists are bleeding and broken. i have always had to keep my pain silent. the last thing i want is to be a nuisance. sometimes i feel like my pain isnt real because I've never taken medication or been hospitalised. ive only attempted suicide once and i laugh at it now, because it was so pathetic it barely caused any damage. i dont see a life for myself. i want to cry all the time so people can see how much im suffering. i want to be able to say the correct thing i want to be enough but im not and never was enough for anybody. i wish i didn't have so much hatred in my heart, but i wish my parents never met and never gave me my damage. i don't want to do this anymore. if god could give me one thing, it would be to disappear as if i never existed , so nobody mourns me and nobody is left with the scars of my death. another part of me wants them to hurt. i feel disgusting. i really do not want to be a nuisance to anybody anymore. im sorry if this all sounds fake or made up i dont trust anything i say at this point. and im sorry for the awfully long post.",throwaway41578321,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wha1u4/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

i’m trying.,"i’ll be 21 this month on the 19th. i’m a daughter to 2 parents who don’t know how to raise children. i still live at home because the rent here in california is impossible, but i’ll be graduating from college next year in may and hopefully i’ll have the courage and a little more money to try and get out of here. 

i hate living here. about a year and a half ago i completely stopped talking to my family. i completely just went mute. my whole life has consisted of my parents breaking out into fights over my dad’s cheating, my mom takes it out on me, and then one day they just completely act like nothing happened. they have no fucking idea how confusing and damaging that is to a kid. to watch your parents have a screaming match, give each other the silent treatment for like a week, and then one day when i come home from school they’re chatting over lunch as if nothing happened. this happened again 2 years ago — the big fight. over the same thing. my mom tried to take it out on me and it triggered the fuck out of me. i couldn’t believe this shit was happening again, and so i defended myself. mom didn’t like that and she talked to my 2 sisters saying that i was ungrateful and whatever other lies she got them to believe enough for them to stop talking to me. 

my family (except my dad) don’t talk to me anymore. i never talk unless i’m at work. i don’t have any friends. i don’t plan on attending graduation because my family won’t be there in good spirits. i don’t know what i’ll do after graduation. i don’t have any hobbies because i just can’t be fucking bothered with anything. i’m angry all the time. just one glance at my mom and it feels like my skin is on fire. 

suicide has been on my mind for the past 2 years even moreso than when i was a teenager. i’ve made specific plans, and i’ve tried pills but it hasn’t worked. but i try to get out of it. i do try to be happy. meditation worked for a while, but then i started drinking. i stopped drinking and been clean for a couple months now and i’ve started going to the gym. the gym helped so fucking much. i remember back in june driving to the gym and thinking that i liked my life so much in that moment that i didn’t want it to end for once. in fact, i remember thinking that i’d be really sad if it did end right then and there because i actually had activities i was looking forward to. i don’t feel that way anymore. i woke up yesterday at 6:30am and immediately started crying because i did not want to be here. today i woke up and kept my eyes shut for a while hoping i would just go back to sleep because i don’t wanna be here. i brushed my teeth and washed my face because that usually helps me get the day started. then mom shouted at me about slamming my bedroom door, which i didn’t but she’s in a bad mood — she just wanted to pick a fight with her punching bag. i planned on having breakfast but the shouting ripped away whatever motivation i had for this morning. 

i don’t want life after graduating college. i plan on moving out, even if i could only afford rent for a couple months, because it won’t matter anyway. my last months will at least be spent away from the toxicity of my family. i’ve tried to get better. i’ve don’t so much for myself and i’ve rises from the toughest situations, but the motivation for that comes and goes. and rarely does it come. i have to force it. i don’t want to force it anymore. it makes me cry because i have a little love for myself, and i don’t like how i’m treated. i don’t like that i hurt myself. i don’t like that this life is hurting me. i’m so fucking tired. i walk around this house knowing i’m not wanted here. “you’re so impossible to live with” my little sister told me the other day. i literally don’t even speak.

I’m tired of being asked if I’m okay.,"Would you like the short answer? No. I’m not okay. 

I’m not okay, and I haven’t been okay for a long time. Every day I feel like something is wrong and I’m just trying to fix it as I go about my day. At work, I try my hardest to do my best and be happy for the people I work with and for, but sometimes it’s too much to ask. I can’t take how many times I’ve been asked if I’m okay or if something is wrong. By everyone. If I hear it one more fucking time I may snap. I want to tell them to leave me alone and that I’ll be fine but the truth is I don’t know if I’ll really be fine. I’ve gotten so close to being admitted that it’s no longer funny to me. I don’t wanna make jokes about myself anymore because it’s gotten that morbid.

Any and every time I’m not smiling like a bitch, someone just HAS to ask if I’m okay. It never fails to happen. I understand they’re just trying to be nice, but by now, the answer should be obvious. It’s so annoying and it puts me in an even worse mood, too. I don’t want to talk to anyone about my feelings, especially YOU.

Everything just gets worse. Constantly. Forever. No friends. No family. Can't trust anyone. Can't feel love. Can't work. Can't save money. None of my hobbies interest me anymore. I'm struggling just to think of a reason to really keep going on other than something as stupid as spite.  


Who is left to spite? Myself? My ex-family doesn't care if I'm alive or dead, that's always been true.

Wishing I could press a reset button,"Apologies if this post is a little long.

I (26m) really can’t see how I ever recover from the situation and head space I am currently in. 

I feel so guilty for feeling this way and putting myself into the position because I’ve had every opportunity to make something good out of life.

I’ve been to uni, got a first in my masters and completed my professional training. I’ve worked for 2 of the biggest firms in my field (albeit on low salaries) and due to start at another top firm on Monday with an average salary.

I’ve felt depressed consistently for at least a decade now, maybe longer. I will have good days but never really get to experience a meaningful consistent streak of them. I can’t remember the last time I went more than 2/3 days without thinking about ending it all. I have thought about how to end it and planned how to on so many occasions. 

Fundamentally, I know deep down that if I was to do anything I would just be taking the pain I feel and forcing it onto everyone else that knows me. 

I recently split up with my girlfriend of 2 years. This is the second long-term girlfriend, both of which had been really good to me and been amazing people which I have decided to split up with. It’s feels like I am trying to self destruct at times. 

Once I finished uni I had some debts which took some time to sort but I managed to pay off. Over the past 5 months since leaving my girlfriend, I’ve fallen off the rails. Spending above my means, drinking excessively and on several occasional booked last minute trips to try and get away for a bit. This inevitably has caused my debt to rise and now I am probably around 10k in the red. This is highly embarrassing to manage in such a short space of time and feels so manic. 

I hadn’t told anyone about my current debt or previous debt (apart from my ex girlfriend, who again was extremely supportive). 

In June, I was staying at a friends, who had a big pot of ibuprofen pills. We’d been out drinking all night and when we got back to the flat, I took roughly 30 of these before bed and had written a small note. I don’t know if this was a genuine attempt or just a cry for help/attention seeking. Either way, I felt deeply ashamed and embarrassed.

2 weeks ago, my mum came downstairs one evening and found me crying so I decided to finally tell her how I’ve been feeling all these years and about my current situation. I did not mention the pills due to shame. Her reaction only made me feel worse as it came across as more annoyed that I hadn’t said anything sooner rather than comforting.

I used my last available money to fly to the first destination (Greece) possible and haven’t spoken to my mum properly since. I just got back home yesterday and have been hidden away in my room. Obviously this just made me feel worse, more guilt etc. 

I feel like an absolute mess. I’ve messed around my parents. I’ve left the two most kind, caring and supportive people in my life on both occasions. I’ll go days without texting my friends back because I’m too anxious to go on my phone and they’re all looking out for me. Ridiculous financial decisions. All whilst having every opportunity to live a great life due to my education and work opportunities.

I never thought I’d actually get myself in a position to be so close to doing something which I know is silly but I can’t see any other way at this point.",snoop11,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wh7ct5/wishing_i_could_press_a_reset_button/

Don't know what to do,"I am 20 years old right now and been living in a chronic suffering for the past 4 years. It will be very long text, but I just wanted to take this off my chest.

Since childhood I had mostly an introverted personality. I hated this about myself, because I had always wanted to be much more social, but I had difficult times finding someone.

I decided I would have more friends after I graduate from high school and attend a college. Spend more time hanging out with my peers, traveling around and so on. That was what made me happy after all. I studied very hard and to my family's surprise, I got into top 3% in the State University Admission Examination, which meant I could pick any university with State Scholarship. That was very blissful moments of my life but did not last long.

My aunt wanted to me to marry her daughter and told my parents. My initial answer was, of course, a big NO, but due to our shared family history with her (She helped us a lot financially in the past), she wanted to forcibly make a marriage between her daughter and I, because of what I call ""curse of success"". After countless hours of conversation with my parents, I was very frustrated. I was 16 at that time and my parents were the only ones I trusted, and finally gave up arguing with them, which resulted in my loss.  


Not only I am against relative marriage, but also did not like her daughter at all. I did not have any prior experience with any girlfriend so, for the past 4 years I have gone through some sort of Pre-Hell with her. She was not interested in me either, and always had been very neglectful, negative, repulsive to me. Due to the difficulty of my university studies, I was able to convince my parents to postpone this marriage for 4 years, but the inevitable would come sooner or later. During the 4 years I did my absolute best to prevent the marriage, everything I could besides suicide, but to no avail. You might be tempted to ask, why it is such a difficult problem. There are two answers: 1) it is frowned upon by our society when a girl is not accepted by a family and sent back 2) her father was a strict follower of society's rules and could do anything, I mean, anything (even blackmailing us).  


It has been 2 months since this hell of a marriage ceremony and I am undergoing even more difficulties right now. We have visited Marriage Counseling for a couple of sessions what what the therapist said was she is not ready to take any responsibilities of a family, and I was affected by her neglectfulness very badly. I cannot take any steps back anymore. Even during 2 months, there had been several big fights between us, because of her repulsive nature and my inability to withstand that. I respect her as a person, I do not have any personal grudge, but I also know we are not meant for each other. Again and again, countless big fights and our parents, along with hers are against divorcing. Her father is from higher ups, thus he blackmails to do something bad.  


At my age, my peers from university enjoy their life free of what I am going through. At my age, many discovers themselves, having great time with their friends or working on their future. But I am stuck with something I cannot reverse. I cannot focus building my life, but think how I could have prevented if I did not give up that day 4 years ago. All I think about is there is nothing I can do except for committing suicide, because of some shitty society rules. 

I have wasted my potential all these years on someone/something that had no positive impact on my life, and I really do not know what to do.",nnjdkkks,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wh7aef/dont_know_what_to_do/
Impulsive Mistake,"I’ve been suicidal for a long time, but I had finally started to get a little better. I just moved into a new place, just got a job after a while of not working. And I wanted to get a dog. One that was already housebroken and relatively well trained, so maybe I could just have an emotional support animal(I suffer from Bipolar 2 and a Panic disorder as well). But I went to this rescue shelter just to look at puppies, but they put me in a room and brought a medium/largish dog in, and he’s a good dog, but he’s still a puppy. But I got him, and I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea. My boyfriend and I are long distance, and he was upset that I didn’t tell him before deciding, which is completely fair. But he said he’s wasn’t that upset cause the dog is cute. But, after that first night I realized how much this is going to be. I haven’t even finished unpacking, and I stupidly spent what little money I had on the puppy so when I went to find a kennel(which I thought were cheaper) I panicked in the middle of the pet store. 
I’m going to be taking the dog back. I feel like I’m a horrible person for this. But I feel this is just too much responsibility for me right now. I have no free time anymore because I’m constantly having to watch the puppy so he doesn’t get into anything. I’ve been incredibly suicidal and I feel like I’d like to kill myself whether or not I decide to keep the puppy. My boyfriend is really upset with me, as returning the puppy goes against his personal beliefs but he says he still understands. But he’s told me today that he can’t really help me with this one, and he can’t handle my flip flopping emotions because he’s dealing with suicidal thoughts too. And I know that’s kind of my fault, he had been carrying the weight of my issues for a very long time and thought they would be over(or at least easier) so he’s let go so he can heal but, I just feel so horrible. I feel like I just make everything worse. I made a horrible decision by getting a puppy, I thought it would just fix my problems but that’s not how it works. Puppies are just,, it’s just too much right now. I know he’ll get adopted again so I’m not worried about that, I just feel awful. I feel like I’m a horrible person, and I honestly probably am. I’m honestly considering just ending it after Monday, which is when I can return the puppy to the shelter. Idk.",Leoluvn,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wh7984/impulsive_mistake/

it feels like im rotting inside out,"im tired, i have nothing. im 22, cant get a job, cant get into school, cant do anything and the things i can do i cant do right.

i might as well be a door mat, completely useless i cant do anything right. im done, i feel like im rotting inside out, living isnt worth it if i have to be like this.

i wish i could go to school, i wish i could have friends, i wish i could have my own room, i wish i could hold eye contact, have conversations, be normal.

but i cant, i cant live without being stressed and i cant tell anyone.

i wish i could be my own person, but i dont even know what that would be.

im nothing at the end of the day and being nothing hurts too much.

i have no plans and i have no future, nothing i try seems to work and all i do fails.

i wish i could tell someone this, but even if i had someone to share i probably wouldnt, i cant speak.

my face is fucked and my life is meaningless.

my mom is having another daughter, she doesnt need me anymore, this is good. she can try again, im sure my little sister will be great.

im sure she will be loved, like my little brother is,

i did what i was supposed to, i was the test dummy for two idiot kids that got pregnant too soon, i can be thrown away now that they know how to be good parents.

i is oddly serene to think about it this way, im the eldest of five and all my siblings will have a good life.

i feel bad for my girlfriend, but i think she'll be fine, she's amazing. i hope she gets into cop school, she really wants that.

i hope my mom's business can take off and she can stop worrying so much.

i hope my latest boss gets his pitch deck approved and gets to work on the show he created.

i hope my dad stays present for his new kids.

when i leave this body i want to be reborn as a cat.

i was rotting the moment i took my first breath, this is my natural state.

To spend shit ton of money so it amounts to nothing? It doesn't hurt so should I just avoid it and keep going even with that looming fear over my shoulder.

I used to be somebody,"I've done things which I am so proud of, the realization of seeing an idea srpout from the ether into reality. This isn't a one off either. For example I've dabbled in writing fiction, creating an abstract strategy board game and other creative outlets. 

For perspective I'm a Scorpio, born in a dog year.or a type 3 Scorpio depending on how your look at it. Suzanne White's ""new astrology"" pretty much nails my personality down. Not that I'm letting these archetypes define me, I'm just offering context.

For the past few years now I've barely been able to make it into work. Theres anxiety about just dealing with people in general because I don't want to open up about what I'm dealing with. Part of that is parenthood, and having a teenager going through their own struggles and essentially being helpless to help them. This is where anyone who wants to call me a selfish asshole for being a parent and being suicidal can dip. You don't know my story.

Around the same time frame of 3 or so years ago I was bouncing from place to place and had a landlord who was stealing my crap, and the next place was good until it was infested by bedbugs and that really fucked me up.

I'm in my own place now, and lately I realize I'm just a nobody. I live alone, my friends have all moved away or adulted up into marriage or whatever, and I don't get out anymore. I used to go hiking and camping, usually with a friend and because of covid, finances or no social circle it just doesn't happen anymore.

Every time I reach out people tell me how fucking simple it is to just go out and meet people, like its magic. At work I don't want to open up when someone asks me how I'm doing because if I tell them what's REALLY going on then I have to open up with backstop, reopening old wounds and honestly I hate feeling and looking weak. So I bottle it up. Nobody knows.

Gonna kms after Everfree NW,"4 months ago when I still had disposable income I bought a ticket to a my little pony convention. I only bought a ticket because it's close, I can pack a lunch and take the bus at very little cost and not have to worry about huge travel and lodging bills. Lately money has been even tighter and tighter and I'm having to regularly take money out of my bank account to buy groceries on payday then go into negative when the bills come out a few days later or cancel automatic payments, otherwise I would not be able to afford food. I'm regretting buying the stupid ticket but there are no refunds or reselling (the ticket is tied to your identity) so i'm forcing myself to go even though I don't know if I will be able to have any fun there because I'm just so depressed. Ironic because I am cosplaying the element of laughter. On the last day, instead of getting on the bus to go home again, I will run out in front of a bus that is going 40+ mph or more. I read that you have a 90% chance of dying by that method. I like those odds. I practice witchcraft, i made a sigil that will garuntee my success. Nothing that anyone can do or say to stop me so don't even try, just wanted to throw out there that I'll be going to this con, if anyone in the Seattle area wanted to meet up and make my last days here on this earth slightly more meaningful.",Babbling_dragon,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wh6m7l/gonna_kms_after_everfree_nw/

They'd rather me be a suicidal Christian than a happy Satanist.,"I went to a Rise Against concert last night. A band who, on stage, condemned the rich, homophobia, hate speech, and nationalism. On the way in, a group of maybe 20-30 Christians were proselytizing. Holding up the signs saying we're going to hell. One had a microphone and a speaker and was just... going hard at us while we were just trying to go to a concert.

I finally have contact with my dad's sister. But I've specifically not told her I'm a Satanist. She was always super Christian but liked rock music, supernatural TV shows, horror movies, etc.

So I texted her about it laughing, because Christians aren't supposed to proselytize like that.

... She said she's praying I am saved and don't go to hell. And she said this while ranting about my lifestyle, yet thinking I'm a cishet Christian woman instead of a Satanist, bisexual transman.

I'm scared. I'm going to be pulled back into Christianity from the fear mongering. And when I do, the countdown to suicide starts up again. I'm happy as a Satanist. I'm living life. I feel free. But these people... they'd rather me miserable and then dead.",mommy-fetish,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wh4pdh/theyd_rather_me_be_a_suicidal_christian_than_a/

Suicide as a coping mechanism?,I (33F) feel beyond suicidal. In a relationship with a compulsive liar that has become toxic and physically abusive.

I have no hope or dreams or future goals anymore because I’m waiting for him (who took away our dreams and goals together) while he creates a life for himself without me. All day every day all I think about it wanting to kill myself and escaping this hell. I can’t let him go. It’s torture. I’m killing myself inside holding onto a man who doesn’t want me. I have 2 young children (9 and 6) and try and remind myself they need me no matter what. But I’m a mess. And certainly no mother to them this past year at least. I don’t want to go out.

What do you do as you realize the depression and mental illness wont go away?,"I try my best to be the goodest person I can be. I try to help people whenever I can. Say hi, give compliments, wish strangers a good day, etc. A lot of time this feels so useless; I can’t change anything. I wont change anything. Things are so bad, people can be so unempathatic, people can be very mean. It depresses me on top of my already existing depression. I have lost so much and what’s terrifying is that I can lose more, things can always get worse, there still are types of sadness you know are ahead but you know you’re not ready for because your heart cant take that kind of shattering of the current logic of your reality and what/whom you value and value the presence off and time with. 

I hate myself. I really do. The depression has gotten worse. I’m older. The suicidal thoughts and how you deal with them changes. It’s almost like you’re tired, like they wear you out more and more, like a parasite you have to learn to deal with but know you’re getting weaker by the second due its presence, even if it hibernates from one season to the next, and that it will consume you eventually.

I am really bad at talking to people and i’m really bad at expressing my feelings in any way without becoming a mess. I just spend every day doing nothing, killing the time every day until school starts up again and that will be a literal hell. I don’t want to explain why because just typing the situation makes me incredibly upset, but let’s just say I feel scared, misunderstood, incredibly upset, and like i’m worth less than others. There is someone who makes me stupidly happy for no real reason, but because I have very bad social anxiety my brain really thinks that he doesn’t care about me and that I shouldn’t talk to him, even though he’s said before that he does care about me and appreciates me. Sorry that this is all badly written, it’s now 6:04 and I spent a long time trying to figure out words to make how I feel make sense. The reason why i’m posting it here is because I don’t think my friends would care that much, I’m sure only a few people at most is gonna read this anyway.",_LoverLoner_,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgrivz/just_walking/
I fucked up,"My life's been having it's ups and downs, so I commit selfharm on a daily basis to forget what makes me feel like trash *but* a few weeks ago my cousin (7) saw my scars and basically forced me to admit what they're from (even tho I tried lying he still pulled it out from under my tongue) I begged him not to tell anyone as it'd break their hearts. Fortunately he agreed. There wasn't much happening after that so I just hoped he forgot about it. 

Two weeks later he tells me out of the blue that he ""wanted to do it too"" and that ""I just want someone to stab me"" 

Fast forward another week or so that he tells me he even ""tried using a knife this time"" but couldn't do it 

He even begged to me to give him my knife a few times

I can't exactly tell this to a therapist cuz I'm sure they'll just rat me out to my parents

Why?,"Why should I want to live? Don’t give me an emotional answer give me facts.

I have no desire to live. I’ve cut myself multiple times in the last week and have barely noticed the pain anymore. For the past five hours I’ve kept a knife in arms reach. There is a box of 31 paracetamol within my reach.

I’m ugly, fat, stupid, immoral, lazy and borderline psychopathic at times. I’ve got horrible hair and fashion sense, eat through snacks like an American, couldn’t socialise to save my life, spend my time reading and gaming and watch videos of people being tortured to death with a laugh. The only way I see to get rid of the pain is alcohol and I can’t afford that. 

Every path leads to the grave so why bother trying to walk away from it? I’m going to end up dead anyway so why go through all the suffering when I could just end it now? My death will have no impact, in time I will be forgotten and my death turned to nothing more than a statistic. My life has neither meaning nor value so why should I bother with it?

I need help. I don't know what to do,"I need help.

I have ruined my relationship of over 10 years over the tiniest of things.  I lied about speaking to another woman.  There was nothing going on with the other woman, just pleasantries and support as she had told me she was having a hard time.  I know my partner is the jealous type, so I lied.  I shouldn't have. It is my fault. that lie has irreperably damaged any trust that she had in me.

This is bad enough, but there is more.  I was recently diagnosed with brain cancer.  I don't know if my lack of judgement was affected by the damage, or by the news of the diagnosis and subsequent depression.  I don't think it was, I think I was just dumb, scummy and made the biggest mistake of my life.  Either way, this combination is excruciating.

I cannot think of anything else.  All I can think of is the hurt I caused over nothing and how even if i reconcile, i am likely to burden her with my failing body.  I turned a nothing into a huge deal. Had I been honest there would have been no issue, I have always been honest about speaking to other people before. I caused this. But even if I didn't, and everything was status quo, I can only offer future pain as my mind is eaten by the growth in my head.

Now I cannot live with myself.  It eats at me constantly.  I go back and forth between thinking about begging for forgiveness and just removing myself from the equation.  Then I think about how removing myself could inflict more pain and a downward spiral ensues.  I literally have the drugs ready on the table in front of me. I pick them up then equivocate.  Then berate myself for being to weak to do it.

"LONG RANT - I've achieved my dream life, and I'm on my way to suicide. [Marked NSFW because of references to SA and ED]","(Apologies for the long post, I just really need to get it all out on a page, even if it's just for me. Please feel free to scroll past.)

I'm in such a good place right now. I'm in my early twenties, making 6 figures in a cushy engineering job straight of college. I'm getting raving feedback from my coworkers, who are all rooting for me to get promoted. I'm eating three self-cooked meals a day, good meals: fish, spinach, pasture-raised eggs, produce in all the colors of the rainbow, you name it. I'm living in a luxury apartment with a room I've decorated how I've always dreamed I would, and I bought myself my dream car. I exercise regularly and get a good amount of sun and cardio with a dog who I love with all my heart.

I've never been more certain that I'll commit suicide.

I've always struggled with depression. Severe depression at times. I've gotten close to killing myself at least three times (suicide note written and sealed, door locked, knife to my wrist or rope around my neck). I've never done it because I was always convinced things would get better, but they never did.

As a child, I was heavily abused both physically and emotionally. For trivial ""sins"" like eating too slowly or spilling a cup of water, my dad used to drag me into the bathroom, force me to strip myself completely naked, and he'd hit me until I couldn't breathe. If I didn't cry hard enough, he'd hit harder, and if I cried too hard, he'd hit harder because I was crying hard on purpose. Almost a decade later, I can still remember the white rings that would wrap around his irises when he would yell at me, the way his face contorted. It would echo off the walls, his anger, his yelling, his slamming. It was endless. My mom loved and admired him wholeheartedly, still does.

Privacy was never a thing. If I wanted to listen to a ""pagan"" song, I'd have to print out the lyrics for my mom to approve. YouTube was banned. The Internet was more or less banned as well. If I wanted to hang out with a friend, my mom would have to have a dinner with the parents first. If I bought myself a phone or tablet, it would go on my parents' dresser every night before bed, and they'd go through it every night. My dad used to brag proudly about how if he found out that we liked someone, he'd tell everyone and make jokes about it and make *sure* we were embarrassed. So naturally, romance was never a thing either.

I never got a break. I was home schooled for the first 14 years of my life, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, and my dad was a pastor who only ""went to work"" on Sundays, so I was always within reach. I was never allowed to have a bad day. But complaints that they expected me to be perfect were scoffed at because they didn't beat me for other, more trivial things, did they? I remember being very young, curling myself into my closet, and writing that I wanted to die, that I hated my parents, that I wanted them to die, that something, anything would happen to make it all end.

Ironically, those were the happy years. Or at least, the only years where I don't remember **actively** planning to kill myself.

Around 13 or 14 years old, I started growing pubic hair, so my dad stopped beating me, but by then it was too late. They sent me to a public high school when I was 14 because they saw it as a test of my faith in the Lord (the only test I failed lol), and as soon as I got there, I worked like a menace. By then, I was sentient enough to know that this was my chance to get to a good college on a good scholarship, which would be my ticket out of their house.

I played the game. I took an unhealthy number of honors and AP courses, I joined ASB, created charity clubs and got recognition from the city for my contributions, used no-credit courses to boost my GPA, I was captain of my sports teams, played up to varsity, joined NHS, Key Club, all those scams. I was in it to win it.

At home, I had to listen to hours of my dad screaming at my less-ambitious older brother, threatening to kick him out or beat him. Sometimes it was because my brother forgot his assignments at home, other times it was because he wanted to hang out with his friends when he had a B in English. It wasn't like he was a bad student. He was still a brilliant honors student with a 4+ GPA. He just didn't care about perfection. And that was unacceptable.

I worked myself to illness. I was getting an average of three hours of sleep, and I'd picked up the nasty habit of hitting or starving myself whenever I made a mistake. I'd stay up all night setting ridiculous standards for myself. I had to memorize a chapter of my textbook verbatim or I was undeserving of sleep. I had to hit a can with a volleyball in the dark or I was worthless. I had to complete a practice AP exam in half the time limit, or I was pathetic. I failed, I had to start over. If I needed water or sleep, I was weak. I got hospitalized for several days with a fever of 106 after a particularly rough finals week.

My parents loved it. Bragged about me all the time. It was the first time I'd ever felt valued by them. I began to think things could be okay if only I'd stay perfect.

So the exhaustion and illness didn't teach me. Nothing did. And in senior year, it finally caught up to me. With the pressure of the college applications, the last step to the final verdict, I couldn't take the possibility that I could fail. I began to plan my suicide. I'd already begun cutting regularly and alienating myself from my friends. My chronic self-starvation and sleep-deprivation certainly didn't help.

On the day I planned to kill myself, I set aside the suicide note and the blade, and I was going to kill myself right after school. But by some miracle or tragedy, my favorite math teacher noticed something was off, and I was in an ambulance to the ward before I knew it.

In the days and weeks following, I was bedridden. My parents were furious. They told me I was trying to guilt trip them. They told me I would go to hell. That I thought I was better than God. That I was ungrateful. Selfish. Stupid. Crazy. Then they would cry because they were worried. They sent me to a therapist who broke HIPAA to tell my parents I was upset with them. They sent me to another one who ""really liked it"" when I wore shorts. I didn't talk to any of my friends. I cut myself endlessly. I skipped my meals. I would get up at random points of the day and walk all the way across the city and hope someone kidnapped me or hit me with their car. Then my brother would find me, and back to my bed I'd go.

I was caught in limbo. I had to make the decision. Either I'd kill myself and stop the torture, or I'd fight on and try my hand at living in college and create the life I knew I could create. I wanted both outcomes so badly my chest ached.

But I chose the latter. I picked myself up, forced myself to do the assignments, forced myself to ace my tests, forced myself through. I chose to believe in a better future. I chose to work towards that future.

I graduated top of my class, albeit less gracefully than I'd hoped, and got into the ""number one university in the U.S."" on a huge scholarship with the most selective major, exactly what I'd worked for. I was ecstatic. I'd chosen correctly, hadn't I? I packed my things and moved into the dorms.

It didn't take even a year in college before I was raped. Looking back I can see it so clearly how it all happened. I was so excited, so hopeful. The people around me weren't the ""shady devils"" with cigarettes and raspy voices that my parents taught me to fear. They were academics. Aspiring engineers who took AP classes and SAT summer courses. People who like libraries. People of the same cut and mold as me... right?

I didn't question it when my best friend offered me a snack with an innocent smile. And when the ceiling was swimming above me, and he was between my legs, it was too late to question it. Afterwards, everyone laughed about it. Called it ""crazy"" in that grinning, head-shaking way all college adventures are reminisced on. This repeated itself several times, until I considered it a kindness when he'd fuck me without drugging me because at least I wouldn't get a headache after.

It wasn't until I tried to resist him that it got violent, so it wasn't until then that I'd ever considered the possibility of rape. It wasn't like my parents had ever taught me anything about consent. And I hadn't been around enough people to know that the words ""I can't wait to see how I change you"" were a red flag in a friendship.

When the big, violent Rape happened, the kind that gets passed around in newspapers, it was too late. He and I were in the same friend group, and stepping away from him meant losing all my friends, friends who were in my dorm, in all my classes. I tried to talk to my rapist, but he wouldn't listen. I confided in one of the friends in the friend group that something might've happened and asked if it was something I should bring up, and he said I shouldn't.

I woke up the next morning to find that all of them had blocked me on all social media platforms and were under the impression that I was going around, falsely accusing people of rape. When I tried to apologize, they laughed and said I should be glad I wasn't getting gang raped. I tried to report it, and the college did nothing. The boys found out I tried to report and told the RAs I was threatening their health and safety. I was put into a year-long investigation to see if I would get expelled.

I almost killed myself twice. Was hospitalized twice. Was forced to make the choice twice. Life or death? I'd already lost so much. Everything I'd worked for in high school. College was ruined. My grades were suffering. My friendships were ruined. Everything was shit.

And despite it all, I chose life again. I chose to believe it would get better. That I could build things up again.

Then COVID hit. I was back at my parents' house.

They'd recently undergone a ""transformation"". My dad no longer yelled, and so I, of course, was under obligation to reward him with a deep father-daughter connection. And my mom? Well, she'd never done anything wrong, ever.

My dad, after finding out I was raped, starting making rape jokes. If my dog would jump on him in greeting, he'd yell, ""Me Too! Me Too!"" My mom started saying I was prettier before I got raped. My hair was nicer, my clothes fit better, before. ""Why are you so mad?"" they'd ask. ""Why don't you spend time with us?"" And I'm rushing through this because this post is way too long, but given that it was 2020, it was bad. Really, really bad.

I chose life. I dug my heels in and reverted to my high school self. Worked myself to ashes. Yanked my GPA up. Took 20+ units a quarter. I dodged the expulsion and graduated a year early from college with honors and a job lined up. With my picture in a slideshow and my diploma in the mail, I packed up and moved away.

I moved away, and I built the life that I have now, my dream life, and I am miserable.

I've developed delayed-onset PTSD. I have vivid nightmares of shit as far back as my dad yelling at me for taking 20 mins to eat a meal. Or plain old flashbacks of being raped. I smell weed and remember the weed on my rapist's breath when he was raping me. Any time I go to the office for work and I'm surrounded by my all-male team, I have intrusive visualizations of them gang-raping me and of my parents finding my mutilated body and making jokes about it. Any time one of my teammates says anything in a slightly altered tone, I'm terrified.

I'm struggling with OCD and perfectionism that has only worsened since I've moved out. I have an awful, impending sense of doom when things aren't ""just right"". I constantly doubt myself, put myself down. I stress about work until I'm shaking, and I check and recheck everything I do.

My manager loves me and says all my teammates think I'm incredible, that I'm super smart and helpful and make everyone's lives so much easier, but I wish they didn't notice me at all. I feel like I'm expected to be likeable because I'm the only non-man on a team of roughly 20 men who are all at least 7 years older, so I can't get away with not being likeable, but I don't know how to be likeable. I'm terrified of them. I don't trust my own tongue. None of my jokes or words come out right, and I sound all wrong. I worry about being too ugly to respect and too pretty not to rape.

I don't know how to make friends. I've forgotten how. I'm scared. I don't trust my own judgement anymore. I don't know what the rules are. If I'm being annoying. If my laugh is too strident. If I'm asking too much. If I'm accepting too much. If I'm giving too much. If I'm giving too little. How often to make eye contact. What the hell I'm supposed to talk to them about.

I feel like there's a certain way that people live when they have friends. They form their thoughts like they're things meant to be shared. They develop hobbies with room to breathe, with ways to invite others in. They read books with discussion topics in mind, with the desire for others' input and the assurance that they will receive it.

Between my isolated childhood, my traumatized isolation, and COVID, I have rarely had occasion to think this way. If someone asks me what I think of something, I have thoughts, and they come out complete, polished and sealed, with a beginning, middle, and explicit end that rounds the conversation off and shuts it down. I don't know how to foster a conversation that promotes discussion. I don't know if I ever have. And at this point, I think it's too late to try because everything inside my head is defective or broken or desperate, and I cry far too much to make any friendship pleasant.

Because I moved away from my home, away from my abusers, I am also separated from everything familiar to me. All my high school friends are dispersed across the country. I connect with them digitally through social media, but I think they're getting tired of me. I send too many things to them, respond too eagerly. It's pathetic. I am so lonely.

I feel myself spiraling again, and I know this time, this is it. If I fall apart, my job, my independence, my autonomy, my options to flee if my rapist shows up at my door, everything. Everything is at risk.

And if I fall apart again, what am I supposed to do, choose life again? Choose to work for that better future? For what?

I've learned by now that the phrase ""life gets better"" isn't true. Yes, life will get better, but then it gets worse again. Far worse, before you can even recover from the first blow. Life isn't a fucking movie where the One Big Bad Thing happens and the protagonist just has to work through that, and then the music changes, and you know it's over. There is no music telling you it gets better, there is no One Big Bad Thing, it's just life, brutal and volatile and long, and you are stuck in it for the rest of your life.

I'm starting to get the sense that suicide is just a logical conclusion to a life like mine. I've had so little control over my life, I feel like the very least I can do for myself is give myself control over how it ends. And I know all the statistics about failed suicide attempts, but at this point, I don't care.

It's not that I think my suicide would mean nothing. I know there are people who love me, who look to me for help or inspiration. But how much more do they want? Haven't I given enough? I tried so hard. Wasn't it enough? If not, then will there ever be a point where I've given enough? If not, then am I really the problem?

It's not that I think life won't get better. I know I have it in me to make life get better. I know that if I wanted to, I could push forward and make myself something incredible. Or just make myself content with being pleasantly mediocre. But for what? To get hurt again? To lose again? To watch everything I've worked for fall to pieces again?

I've proven myself, and I am tired.

The only thing that keeps me going my dog and a stupid shred of hope that I am wrong. I am doing all the right things, feeding myself well even when I want to starve myself, I am exercising, drinking water, sleeping, going outside in hopes that I can at least make it long enough to support and love my dog until he dies.

But I feel myself slipping slowly. I relapsed on cutting after over a year of being clean. Bought myself nice, sharp cutting blades too. I dropped my therapist when the company screwed up my insurance and acted really shady, and I don't have the energy to look for a new one. I am two poorly timed disasters away from giving up completely.

I am so bitter and angry that I am realizing this now. I wish I'd killed myself in high school. I am so wrong now. Every inch of me, every cell of me, all of it is wrong and far too touched, but not touched enough, and I will die this way. I feel delirious and sick. I want to laugh it's so foolish. I'm so foolish, sitting here in my nice, expensive apartment that I comfortably afford, typing at a fancy computer, away from my abusers, well-fed, safe, with a stable career, typing about how sad I am, how sorry my life is.

Why am I not happy? Why am I so miserable? Why can't I just get over it and shut up? I know why, but I wish it didn't manifest itself in this way. I'm tired.

Anyways, if you read through this whole thing, you deserve a gold star and to do something that makes you smile, so make sure you go and do that. And if you have any words of advice, I'd appreciate it, but no worries if not. Thanks for sticking through it :).

my brain stopped making it seem hard,"i’ve been like this for over 12 years now, just a little under half my life. at one point most of it was just a messed up brain, then my life started to nosedive completely. so many deaths, so many hospitals visits, breakups, friend loss, and absolutely no feeling when i accomplished anything. i have friends who love me, i have a partner who loves me, i have a lot of great traits but this cloud still exists.

i tried everything under the sun. just powering through it, therapy, meds (so many meds in the last 2 months that i started randomly showing bipolar symptoms). but it’s just not working. my depression got so out of hand for the last year that i spend most days unable to leave my bed and can’t work or do any hobbies. every day feels more and more like rock bottom.

im usually used to it, but for the last 6 months my brain is no longer making it seem like ending my life is a difficult thing. i sat with a sheet around my neck ready to hang myself not caring who would find me or it would impact (this is typically my reason for not doing anything to myself) and now my brain has just been telling me that the bridge is only 15 minutes away. it’s just one jump and all my problems are done. its telling me how easy this tutorial to make a hangman’s knot looks and to go up the highest fire escape and make sure i snap my neck. it feels like my only barriers stopping me from doing it are eroding and i feel every day im just one slightly bad moment away from finally doing it.

Unfortunately we live in another countries and I didn't even get to know her that well, but we already had so much in common and liked very similar things, she was also very inspiring and healthy person.

Have no control over my own life and wish to end it.,"I feel just very alone every single day. I don’t have one person in my life that loves me unconditionally that will always be here for me no matter what and it’s such a hard thing to live with. Everyone tells me it will get better but I’m old enough and don’t think I have a chance.  

My own parents don’t love me unconditionally. All they want is for me to live my life the way they want and if I don’t believe what they do I will end up shunned forever and on the streets (highly religious). Everyone in my life just wants what THEY want for me and not actually how I want to live my life. 

I don’t see myself ever being happy in life no matter what path I choose, so I don’t see the point of not wanting to end everything right now. I wake up and have panic attacks in the middle of the night and I’m tired of it. I’m just a big good for nothing waste of space that is just a burden to all those around me anyway.  I’m not sure what my chosen method will be yet, but I want it to be quick and painless.

I'm too young,"Hello, Reddit, I cannot recall if I've posted on here before on not but I don't really care at this point. 




I'm a 14 year old girl and life stabbed me in the throat as soon as I came out of the womb. Was physically bullied all throughout childhood because of medical condition, suffer from an abusive parent and person, a father whose constantly cheating on and mentally disorganizing his second wife but she stays because we've worked so hard to build our ""perfect family"" seem literal hell right in-front of me with them. Never had a real friend, jeez, never had someone ask me to be friends until I got into 6th grade. 




And to add on to that, I do absolutely nothing all day, since my childhood was so corrupt I grew up watching youtube and playing video games which led me to being a device addict my whole life. Some days I don't even get out of bed and I just spend my days sleeping or thinking about why I am here because I feel like i've wasted so much already, even though I could have many years ahead of me. But it isn't really living, it's just surviving, you know? I don't even know if I can call it surviving though because now it feels like i'm desperately holding on to something that isn't there anymore. 




I've tried multiple things before, starving myself, dehydration, OD on substance used for medical condition,, I just need someone to tell me why the hell i'm still here.

i want to die i want to die i want to die,"My life basically consists of going to work and doing activism outside work to defend my basic existence and access to healthcare etc. as a trans person in the UK (where things are looking extremely extremely bad for our basic rights and look set to be getting much worse, alongside a general economic crisis which is also set to get worse). 

The only thing that gave me happiness and stability was my partner who I looked forward to seeing, stayed over at his house for cuddles whenever I've been stressed and down, etc. And now he says he's fallen out of love with me whilst also saying millions of contradicting things and my head's all over the place. I've called him emotionally abusive in the past and then I stopped believing that and now I don't know what to believe.

Also earlier this year my friends from my only other hobby all decided to side with one guy from the group who became transphobic. Despite me sending them begging messages basically making it clear that my mental health was extremely bad and all I wanted was a reply and maybe some help and support, they all blocked me or ignored me, except for one person who keeps saying insensitive stuff like that I just need to get a new hobby.

I hate my life and I'm only staying alive for my mum and brother and, well, I usually say my partner here but obviously I'm not sure where that all stands any more. I hate myself, the chat with my partner tonight only started because I stalked his social media which I'd promised to stop doing (and I hadn't for months), and tonight I discovered some things I'd rather not have known about via his Twitter, and that make me frankly feel worthless and want to hurt myself.

Tonight I can't stop scratching and scratching myself and I am fighting off the temptation to do more as he's sleeping in my flat at the moment and I don't want him to think I'm a total freak if he wakes up and there are visible cuts on me or blood or whatever. (No offence to people who do self harm, I obviously completely get it and it doesn't make you a freak etc. of course)

I feel permanently distressed and uncomfortable and I just want to die. I don't want to go to work tomorrow, I just want to die. I don't want to wake up. I wish this was all a weird nightmare. I live on my own after being kicked out of my parents' place a few years ago, and I can't cope any more. I have past trauma which my therapist has said will probably never go away, and which haunts me in my nightmares. I've had such a shit life and now I've transitioned and just want to live my life as myself but the government and anti-trans campaigners and the press are trying to stop that from happening now too.

Life doesn't mean much anyway, I'm just one person amongst several billion on a floating rock in space. The world will move on if I go.

I want to do one last good thing,"I dont know what's wrong with me...I cant muster the will to save myself. I left my engineering job because I was super unhappy there &amp; my housing ran up. Unfortunately I didn't have anything else lined up. I THOUGHT that I would be able to find rent somewhere and work whatever I could find before I could move on to something that makes me happy. Unfortunately I'm now in a catch-22 where I need proof of income to get rent...in an area with a housing crisis. I guess I was just an idiot. 

Since then, I've been living in my car for the past 2 weeks. The sun has been scorching me alive. I feel myself...becoming zombified. This is the new normal. I cant even be an efficient homeless person; I know I could get showers at the gym, stay in an air conditioned building, get a job while I live in the car, maybe even fake a proof of income. But it's like...I just can't. I cant accept that this is how it is. Now I keep my car on to charge my phone battery because it's my only source of entertainment and ability to contact rentals. 

I've always had differing views than the majority in my life. I find it really hard to find hope and purpose in the life that so many of us live. Since I've become homeless...class structures have become super apparent to me. Everyone is just falling in line, terrified to be outcasted and doomed to a fate such a mine. No one looks at me and if they do...I get the feeling that they think I am dangerous, or just unproductive scum. Friends that I thought were there for me....yea, they know I'm in this situation...and they dont bother to know how im doing anymore. Like I broke the social contract and now I'm just trouble. All the while humanity itself is heading to its collective doom and we just pretend like it's not a thing.

Cant help but think that by even being alive...I am harming someone. Harming the environment with my car running. Harming animals by eating shitty fast food. I cant stop it...I am weak. I really needed that new beginning. I could become vegan. Reduce my carbon footprint or whatever. But would I really do that? I need change. 

Now instead of circling down the drain...wasting my money away...being mad at the world...I think the biggest impact I could have is to be selfless.To give up everything I own. Donate to animal shelters where they are truly innocent vessels in this life. Maybe my death could be poetic in a sense. Yet...I truly don't want to die. I really don't. It would hurt. There's so much beauty in this world beyond the suffering. I feel like I'm being rational here; like I've gained too much knowledge and it will never go back. I see things for how they truly are. 

I dont expect anyone to read but...I wish they would. So many desperate whispers here in this sub. But guess what? I cant care to read them either. I'm just so caught up in myself. I'm like self aware on too many levels and I cant do anything. Idk. Sorry for the rant.",LagdouRuins,22,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgf4oa/i_want_to_do_one_last_good_thing/

I haven't been eating properly for the last week or two. I barely sleep and I finally showered for the first time in a week.

I cut myself again after not having done so for 6 months. I can't bring myself to be productive. I just roam subreddits such as Am I The Asshole in hopes of helping someone while I allow my own mental state to detoriate.

“Just cheer up! Stop being so emotional! You’re being ridiculous”

I don't want to grow up, not at all. And the weirdest thing is, I still \*feel\* younger. I feel like I'm at least 8-12, I act younger than I am and I want it to stay that way. I want to stay young.  


I feel like there isn't hope for me to stay alive when I turn 18. When I'm an adult, I can't act like a kid anymore. I cant make mistakes, I can't have fun, I can't do anything. I always wanted to grow up as fast as I could when I was younger but now I just want to stay young, I want my mom to cradle me in her arms.

What A Beautiful Feeling This Is. Tired Of Pacing In My Room Dreading The Next Day, When I Accepted This Idea My Chest Felt Lighter Than Air. I Can't Explain This Feeling But I'm Ready, I'm So Ready. I Finally Feel Excited.


I'm 17, Turning 18 Next Year. Can't Drive, Never Had A Job, School Drop Out, Homophobic Family.

Now I'm ""rebuilding"" my plan, actively selling my shit, getting ready to stop renting a flat, choosing an optimal place etc. I still have time, I have to spend more time preparing before I can finally do it    
I'm also preparing mentally and sometimes it gets hard, it's weird to realize it's the end and I'm doing it to myself, this annoying part of me wants to live no matter what, but I learn to distract from it. And most of the time I don't feel anything. I know I most likely will be able to do it and my plan is good enough to not survive an attempt. Sometimes I get excited and want to talk about it because for me it's also something I Created(Plan™) and I feel the need to share how this work is going

I can’t keep doing this bullshit,No friends. No job. Living with no drinking water or ability to cook. Barely functioning. Torturing myself. Do nothing all day. Bored as fuck. No ambition or motivation. Am I just fucking waiting to die? It feels that way. Although I’m not going to wait around much longer because I’m going to try to pluck up the courage to kill myself. Being fucking poor with mental health disorders with no help or people around me has taken its toll. I’m 22 still not recovered from childhood abuse/trauma. These insane fucking people who made me this way still refuse to stop pursuing me. I’m just at the end of my tether with it all. I can’t keep living off meal deals and bottled water. I’m going mental. And I’ve got all these people fucking demanding my time and telling me what to do. There’s no fucking freedom! Leave me alone. Stop fucking harassing me. I just want to fucking deteriorate now. The fighting is over. There’s nothing valiant about continual suffering if it’s not to achieve something. And people fucking twist that shit and it makes me sick. How can you tell someone who’s been tortured and wants to kill themselves that they’re expected to dramatically improve their life and find purpose and keep fighting. It’s totally fucking sick. Yeah it’s sunny and yeah it’s August but fuck me I can’t do it anymore. I just fucking can’t. So I want replies/advice on ways to kill myself and how to psyche myself up to do it. And simple any other sympathetic comment showing any emotion or any statement to quell my feelings or console me will be ignored. So don’t bother.

Almost killed myself Tuesday night,"I had relapsed with selfharming a week earlier after 13 months of being clean and almost killed myself that night as well. Then Tuesday night, at work, I decided that once I finish my shift. I would kill myself. I knew exactly where and how I would do it and what my final words to certain people would be. 

A manager realized I was off and didn't let me leave his office, making me sit down which made me just lose it. The moment I sat down, I completely broke down, just a mess of tears and sobs. One coworker called 911 for me and I was taken to the hospital. 

I've been discharged already and am back home. But a part of me, a large part, still wants to kill myself. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again, I just can't see a future for myself and haven't for years now, I just want to be dead.

I'm losing..,"Every day I wake up it's either by anxiety or lethargic. 
Tw. Just in case. 


 I'm honestly sick of being consistently invalidated because I'm either ""too young"" or ""I'm lying"" especially of my difficult upbringing. It doesn't help that even though I've been diagnosed with ASD, I've had people tell me off that I can't be autistic because I'm not r* slur or I have ""functioning"" limbs said by normal people and some men on the spectrum (their reasoning is that because they're autistic themselves while making misogynistic comments and it grinds my gears the most that they use their autism to make such comments to avoid repercussions while I get double standards?) 

I came from the Philippines and I moved to the US right before high school and it baffles me how the most racist people in that school garnered a large social following that everyone just watched them throw food at me on the bus and I tried my hardest to not get violent because I was months from graduating, finally leaving that ghetto ass county and I was already threatened of getting sued and beaten in the Philippines (they didn't sue me but they had their kids beat me up as a way of ""atoning""). 

I'm sick of everyone. I never once fit in and the few friends I had were only out of convenience. I know I have a bad habit of overexplaining but I'm working my hardest on it while ashamed to admit how I've regressed from all the trauma I've been through, especially after I was finally out of the house. Even though I was a victim, it's hard to think of being one due to how I was consistently beaten that ""I'm never a victim"" especially with the blessings we received.

I admit my life turned a 180 when my step-dad dated my abusive mom. I went from living next to the slums to a gated townhouse when I was 7 but I was miserable growing up in that townhouse because the times my abusive mother was home, she'd beat me till my whole body's numb with either a belt or a wooden stick or stuff that she'd command me to get from her room and if I wasn't fast enough she'd throw that object (from combs to cutlery especially knives) and throw me out of the house on other nights and when I continued to cry, she'd yell for the guard half across the neighborhood to wake them up but the more people watched, the more I get beaten. It didn't matter whether we were at a mall or at home, at least behind closed doors, it's less humiliating but is it any wonder why I don't want to leave the house anymore? She and her family still wonders. 

I'm just done. I have to keep my schizo a secret to everyone who knows me because of how little they already see me being autistic and how ignorant the common denominator are with mental health, but every day I always feel like I'm losing a war and I'm scared of failing again only to be punished by getting 5150 again for losing control. 

Nobody understands me, what more cared because nobody ever tried to listen to anything I have to say unless it's something they want to hear YET I'm the bad person for walking out or why THEY fucking feel especially guilt. 

I'm just oversummarizing all the shit I've gone through at this point and it already reads like a dissertion now so I don't want to say any more of the shit even my therapists have told me seem ""too horrible to be true"". Idk English is my 2nd language and I was just lucky to learn it young because it was mandatory in my country's private catholic school. 
Idk I never want to hear or see the people from my life ever again but as I get older, I feel more left out because this world is just ableist af. I didn't just witness it from my upbringing but also having to watch how everyone treated my uncle with severe cerebral palsy.. I at least will try to make it for his 10yr death anniversary. 

 Even though I'll never be able to go back to the Philippines, I kept your tombstone in my memory because that was the first time I got to see your full name and birthday. You were the only one to stand up for me against your sister and I'll always carry with me the guilt and anger of not being able to be there for you more. Even though I've been to a handful of funerals growing up, it was your funeral the first time I felt.. different. At that time I didn't know what grief was despite thinking 17 meant I should be more mature..

At least when I'm gone, I managed to burn bridges with everyone, especially my abusive family because I know my narcissistic mother will never be satisfied until she buries me just like she did to my uncle, her own brother. 

If my abusive sister is reading this, if ever. Since not once did you ever wonder what more ask why I blocked you for 2 years? Because you blackmailed me about my abortions because your shitty parents couldn't talk to you like a normal person without yelling at US. Whether it's me or them, you always had a condescending tone yet you blamed ME for your childhood when everyone was at your beck and call, but I don't blame you because I was the family scapegoat while you were the golden child (i was the failure while you were the investment), everything that went wrong, it was all my fault. The fact that you took great offense of me just staring blankly as ""glaring at you like a pest"" didn't trigger me but telling me that ""mom has changed so much while you haven't because the past was the past"" just triggered me and in some ways, I'm thankful. I'm finally free. 

Honestly, I'm glad she probably won't be able to read this because she doesn't remember from her toddler years how our abusive mom laid her hand at her for wetting her bed because she was 3.. not once did I ever see my abusive mom help her with her potty training because she had me and Ellen (the maid) to do all the ""gross"" stuff she wouldn't do. Plus the times her parents fought alot especially when we just migrated to the US. But this is a few among others I'm taking with me to the grave.

 So last post. I was raised beside her more as her nanny than ""sister"" because what should my shitty mother know about siblings when she's the adopted one yet not once did she ever let her own brother sit on the same dining table with her.  My step-dad is sexist that he only really cared for his son while ""girls are just too much drama"" then wonders why no woman respects him because he's attracted to abusers. Sure he could've been worse but he nearly got arrested for being an ENABLER. So the fact they can still be smug just proves how perfect they are for each other. 


If I was such a ""liar"" then why the fuck did my own mother try to kill me especially more so during my adolescence ?  Not because she wants to bury all the shit I had to witness for her? All the shit she says behind everyone's back. Yet I'm the bad person for cutting myself off from my shitty family because not once did I even once think I was ""good"" because I was NEVER good enough for them. No. They always reminded me how I'm the worst pos that she wished she never gave birth to all because why? I was ""difficult""? Literally I had signs that I wasn't like most kids but I never saw that, instead she just reminded me that I was a failure. I only wanted to end the cycle of abuse that I tried to escape. 

At least I'll die without them ever knowing what more ever hearing from me again. I don't need a funeral, fuck I don't even want one. I'll just stay 27..",Sagoju,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgrj8w/im_losing/

Disheartening Experience Posting Here Not Long Ago,"Hey folks, just wanted to pass on a disheartening experience I had here not long ago after posting about passive suicidal ideation about financial issues, lack of identity and lack of motivation. The gist of the post was a bit of a rant, but truthfully, I was looking for someone to talk to... some validation... I don't know. A few minutes after posting, I had a user post a reply along the lines of the following: ""You are fucked. Just end it. Maybe you'll do something right for once."" Now, I understand trolls post with throwaway accounts every now and then, but I still can't fathom why someone would say something like that to another human being. Lately, my suicidal ideation has been vacillating between passive and active, having recently been hospitalized for a week following that post. Has anyone else experienced this sort of abuse posting here before? I've never had this experience before posting on this subreddit, but thought I might give some other folks a head's up in the meantime. I reported the profile (if my memory serves me) but hearing things like that is very upsetting for me, as someone who has been told to ""kill myself"" to my face by another person when I was much younger. Very disturbing that someone would come here just to say that to another user in need.. seems sociopathic. In any case, just wanted to pass this on.

I keep ruining my life,"This is the worst year of my life. I lost a few pounds and finally had the confidence to start dating apps. The first guy I met we had unprotected sex multiple times in one week. My naive ass took plan b each time with not a care in the world. It didn’t work out with him so I met up with another guy, and also had unprotected sex once with him. The only thing I was scared about was STDs. 

Two months later; no period and weird symptoms, and of course I was pregnant. Not knowing whose it was, but I knew neither of them would be there. I live with my single mom and two younger sisters in a low income community in Chicago. So the best choice was to abort; very traumatic, but I got through it.

But did I learn my lesson? No.

5 months later and I’m very depressed and coping with alcohol. I’m on the pill now but I made a few mistakes this month. I haven’t had unprotected sex since the incident, but when I finally decided to get out of my house and have fun. I got shit faced drunk, and as I’m leaving my friends house her much older, married neighbor approached me in the car and persuaded me into sex. 

Now I’m scared that I might be pregnant and that I have an STD because my throat is sore and itchy days after the unprotected sex. I am disgusted with myself. I hate myself I am disgusted and I hate me. I have to wait so long for anything to show up in tests I don’t think I can wait. What the point if I am pregnant again and/or have an STD I will end my disgusting life anyways. Im so disgusted with myself and I deserve everything I’m going through.

My 'best friend' James asked me if he could borrow one of my minecraft accounts so he could play with his girlfriend. Like the fucking idiot I am, I obliged and changed one of the passwords on an account to give it to him so he could give it to his girlfriend. I asked him if it worked, and I didn't get a response until 9 fucking hours later from him telling me it did. I was irritated at this and asked why it took him 9 hours to respond to something if the account worked or not if it obviously did since he has been playing with her the entire fucking day. He sheepishly replied that he didn't see the message, which I know is fucking bullshit because I have the same settings as him on discord and I get notified as soon as a message is sent to me. I continued my anger upon him, then apologize like a fucking idiot. I need to learn to stop apologizing for things that aren't my fault, I don't know why I apologize to try and fix relationships when I obviously don't matter to the other person. A week after this, he messages me about what browser he should use, and I ask him if he's saying this to try and make up for the minecraft account incident, and he says no he just wants my opinion, then goes to say it's getting late and he'll talk to me tomorrow. He never did. I know FOR A FUCKING FACT HE WILL SAY HE FORGOT BUT IF I FUCKING MATTERED AT ALL HE WOULDN'T FUCKING FORGET. I haven't talked to him since.

I recently just had a falling out with my friend group online that I play League of Legends with because I apparently set someone off. In this group, there is me, E, M, and H. We all poke fun at each other, but I feel as if I'm always the butt of everyone's jokes because I poke fun at a car accident I had when I was little, so H think she is entitled to poke fun at it too. I never let her know it bothered me, but I continued to poke fun at her by mocking her voice, and I pointed out when she kept asking her boyfriend, M, loaded questions like ""Would you still date me if 'X'?"" To me surprise, E and M AGREED with me, but it somehow set H off because later when me and M are talking about haircuts and how I recently got a buzzcut then H, in typical H fashion, begs for attention and tries to make it all about herself (she's done this before) and says ""Guys what do you think about my haircut?"" I say ""Oh my God can you please let us speak stop making everythi-"" then I get fucking kicked and removed from everything. Of course her boyfriend M is siding with her which makes no sense, but I can't tell if I'm gaslighting myself into believing I am the victim or if I was actually just rude to her, cus according to H and M, I was, which makes me feel worse about myself. I tried explaining to M that it wasn't my intention to come off as rude, but she can't make fun of my car accident then get so easily offended by me asking her to not interrupt me, but he says that I'm in the wrong because I made my car accident not seem like a big deal by poking fun at my own accident that happened when I was little, therefore making a joke out of it. Now I am going to lose the only other fucking people I talk to, and I so badly wish for someone to just shoot me in the fucking head.

"An Ex, who I no longer love, made me break down at work, Without being there. any idea why?","I(M18) work at a retail store, it’s the kind of place that you can go hours without seeing anyone. I work entirely alone, no one but me runs the store, it gets very lonely and it’s recently been very mentally exhausting doing mundane tasks and having no human interaction.

Today I was pricing and putting out new clothes, it was a sweater of some kind, however it had this smell, the same smell my first serious girlfriend had. 

We dated for 5 years, most of middle school and half of high school. I loved her, and I guess I still do, but it’s not the same type of love anymore. We broke up 2 years ago, since then I’ve had other serious relationships, none of which have worked out. I no longer care for her too much, she changed a lot during our brake up and after. She was not the same girl I fell in love with. Before she dumped me she became toxic and started to give me trust issues. For weeks I would get anxiety about whether or not she loved me still, it affected me then, and it continues to affect me now and had an impact on my later relationships.

When I smelled that smell today, I smelled her. Her natural scent. It’s not a bad smell, just a uniquely recognizable one. It immediately brought me back to those days filled with anxiety and insecurity. Tears welled up in my eyes and my heart and mind were going a million miles an hour. A couple minutes later a customer walked in and I had to push my emotions away so I could muster a smile and a “welcome, How are you?… oh I’m doing great, thanks for asking, if you Need any help don’t be afraid to ask.” While they shopped I kept muttering under my breath for everything to stop and go away. It didn’t. When the customer left I locked myself in the bathroom for 15 minutes until I calmed down.

"I'm scared to die, but I feel like it's my only option","I was forced out of my home by a minor fire (the only damage was wiring and the back patio) and my life has been a living hell for the past 2 months. My family lost around 3/4 of our belongings because our landlord only gave us 2 chances to get our stuff and we couldn't get any help to do it. My mom and I have been staying with her friend since the fire but we've overstayed our welcome there and will be kicked out any day now. 

I've tried to get a job to help rent another apartment but it feels like a lost cause. I can't find a job because I can't overcome my social anxiety. I'm not qualified for any good ones because i fucked up finishing high school. I just feel so useless and my mom always makes sure to let me know how useless I am too. No matter how much I've helped her around the house, or listened to her vent or walked her to whatever appointments she's needed to go to. The world revolves around income, and because I don't have one, I am basically a waste of space.

I don't know where to go from here. As I stated earlier, we're about to be homeless. I already lost one cat because she had already escaped through a window by the time we were allowed to get our stuff and we're in the process of surrendering our other two cats due to our upcoming homelessness. I just can't take all of these shitty things stacking up while knowing I can't be anymore than a burden. If I don't have a plan by the night we have to leave, I'll probably attempt suicide that night.

My End,"I’ve decided that i will end my life today. Social Anxiety has made my life hell I’ve been bullied throughout all school years i was always the weird kid i didn’t speak with anyone and whenever i had to speak i got nervous i started stuttering and just not making sense people found this amusing but i didn’t every day i got home i cried i had and still don’t have any friends im always silent. And I’m not just saying this i actually mean it i have no friends and never had any friends i was never liked i thought that maybe after school it would change and when i work maybe then i will make friends but its still the same. Although I’m not getting bullied at work i have still heard them make fun of me saying i was a creep and strange and it really hurts. I wish i could be like everyone else they all have fun they talk with each other with no problem meanwhile i can’t even say hello without stuttering or panicking. I don’t leave my home besides for work of course. All i do is work go home and play video games or sleep and on my free days it’s not any different. My parents never cared about me really and since i moved out they seem to have forgotten i even exist I’m only 19 so i can’t say i have experienced much but what i have experienced is terrible for me i feel like i wasn’t meant for this place i feel like i was misplaced or something. And since my rabbits have passed my life has been getting worse they were my only friends if you can count them i talked to them i told them everything and now i am completely by myself. But it doesn’t matter i am sitting at the beach right now its dark i will listen to few songs i like and then just swim out as far as possible until i drown i will be forgotten and hopefully never found.

when your family doesnt know what mental illness even is.,"now aint this awesome? so my father is schizophrenic and i (as a result of many things including OCD) am suicidal, and my mom told me ""we gonna take your father to the psychiatrist this saturday"" and i was like finally! cuz i need it too! then she said ""i need it more than both of you"" not in an assertive way but rather in a tone in which ""yea son im also in pain!"" and i just left cuz it just feels fucking horrible when your mother absolutely dismisses everything youve told her by saying ""im worse than u!"" and i know shes not cuz shes not fighting everyday to stay alive and not end her life i know her i have more awareness than her, she doesnt have friends who beg her to stay alive like i do, the previous generations awareness about mental illness is fucking non existant, im NOT saying shes not struggling, but i know for a FACT that in regards to mental illness and threat on life im worse than her, and yet thats what she says... how can one say that to a suicidal person? ""i have it worse than u"" no you fucking dont. im really not sure if this post aligns with the rules if not im ofc fine with it being removed i just wanted to vent, and if it will stay on, im curious to see how many ppl relate to this, to be dismissed by someone who obviously doesnt have it worse than you. and even worse, a close one to you.",winterrsnow,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgp4ic/when_your_family_doesnt_know_what_mental_illness/

I'm confused,"
So I just created a new account to post this even though none of my acquantances/friends actually ever followed me on reddit.

English is not my main language so excuse some errors here and there.

For privacy's sake I'll say I'm 20, rounding up or down some years, and I'm male.

I don't know when it started or why - my memory always seems to fog up faster than everyone else's - but my vision of the world was always a little sad.
Don't get me wrong when I was a kid I do kind of remember being happy, but I also remember opening the window that faced the street I was living on and telling my mum that if I wasn't enough as a kid maybe I shouldn't have been born (note: judging by some clues left behind in my memory I'd say this episode happened multiple, innumerous times since I was at least 7 or 8 years old)

I wouldn't say I was hated back in elementary school but I definitely was bullied back in middle school. Let's say I kind of got my shit together and pulled through patching things up here and there and almost enjoying my last year there.

High school was weird:
- I got a girlfriend
- I got my bestie (still going strong to this day)
- and I got absolutely destroyed in the process

Here's where I want to make one thing clear: I do consider myself to have friends, and these friends have sometimes shared intimate issues with me so I do feel like I was useful. Yet that's just it.

I only feel useful to others. I find my life to be completely void of meaning.
Every time I interact with someone I set myself up for exploitment. To be honest it's rather hilarious to think about but my spirit animal is probably a front porch rug - Just a flat surface that says ""welcome"" to clean your shoes and be forgotten about when it rains outside.

I broke up with my girlfriend right as covid struck. The relationship felt toxic to me and I felt like I was made a fool of.

I don't want to point my finger at her, may someone bless her soul and may I never see her again. The thing is everywhere I go I feel used and never fulfilled.

It all starts with me helping someone. The possibility of them relying on me for something is intoxicating. It feels as though that will validate me.

And I hate this perception of love I have. It makes me fall victim of so many unintentional exploits. I pass more time helping others than helping myself. And I don't even have a standard. I don't know if I'm bi or just crazy. But it's becoming unbearable.
I can't allow myself to be used by everyone and still have feelings for them after they don't even recognize my presence there.

I just see gray. I help others, get home, realize I'm not fulfilled, get forgotten, cry, wake up, repeat.

I keep waking up and checking my phone for messages that arent there.

I fall in love with everyone so I dont really fall in love with anyone. And nobody loves me, or likes me.

I'm sure my friends would go for weeks without realising I have passed. In a way I feel like I already have proof.

Every time I'm with someone I dissociate, it's just too painful to know you want to die when you're trying to be useful to someone.

And even though my will to live is zero I still commit myself to the burdens of others as if that is going to make me a different, better, saner person.

And so I go back to my bed. Wondering if I'm ever going to finish my studies before ending it all. Wondering if I'm ever going to go back to my psychologist as my bestie (who just knows part of this story) suggested. Telling myself I've done enough today when instead I feel like I'm just waste nobody deserves.

No one will miss me.
My parents are disappointed in every result I bring back home and never fail to make me notice.
I've got a wedding to attend to in some weeks so I've been holdin on as to not ruin it, but I don't know how long I can keep going just on inertia.

Haven't felt happy in so long I just know when I'm not feeling the sadness vs when I am.

That's it, just wanted to post this here since I'm lost.

I really want to live but I also really don't want to suffer anymore.,"I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for about 15 years (I'm 28 now). I've recently been diagnosed with bipolar, autism, adhd, and borderline which has explained so much as my therapy has been ongoing. Im really smart and have always masked immensely well. I figured for quite a while that everyone struggled the same amount but quietly like me. Apparently not.

I live with my parents and own nothing and go nowhere. I keep occupied with pirated streams of tv and a variety of videogames I can replay.

Trying to do the littlest things is a pita. I'd like to help my parents with things like washing the dishes but I agonize over trying to build up the gumption to it for hours and then give up just because it stresses me out so much. I tell that to people and its like they cannot grasp that something like washing the dishes can cause me that much suffering but here I am.

My parents are near wit's end with their ability to tolerate my lack of helping out. I dont really blame them even if I understand to a degree why its hard for me. I have tried to explain it to them but they just dont get it.

I am proud of myself for keeping going this long despite all the suffering and ups and down. I think most people would have given up before now (and I wouldnt blame them). But even I have my limit and I fear it's approaching. If I kill myself, some people will be upset, and I am bothered by that, but odds are heavily in favor of them being better off after a couple months.

I dont really have any questions. I dont have a plan yet, but I have a rough idea of what I'd do to put my plan together if and when I do finally accept that I want to do it. Ive talked to so many people about my feelings over the last decade and a half that Ive learned nothing anyone says makes it better, but Im still always compelled to reach out.

tl;dr at the end.

i had suicidal thoughts for the majority of 2018-2020. around june of 2020, they started to go away and were almost completely gone until a few weeks ago. then i found out that my honorary sister was charged with multiple sex related felonies.

she knows how horribly it makes me feel to know that this shit happens; it's happened to her more than once, it's happened to my other friends, my coworkers, so so many people. however, she also knows i hate being lied to/having information hidden from me. now i feel i don't have a reason to live.

before i go on, trigger warning: gross sexual implication, pedophilia, statutory rape

this sister was a teacher at a high school. she taught two years there, no problem, right out of college. her third year, shit hit the fan. around the end of the school year, she began having sexual relations with a 17 year old student. it ended the day school ended for them. this stayed hidden for a while;  it happened in 2019 and stayed hidden til mid july of this year (about two weeks ago, july 13, 2022). i randomly got a text from her saying, ""i'm im big trouble. i fucked up bad and i don't know what to do."" cue panic. i begin grilling her, trying to figure out what happened. i find out from our mother (my blood, her ""adoption"") a week after about her relations with the student. i was sick.

it was bad enough knowing that not only did she do the thing she knows i hate more than anything at all, but she also hid it from me. but then she lied about the student's age, saying he was 18. still fucked and i was pissed, but i figured it wasn't technically illegal so i wouldn't have to worry about that.

fucking. nope.

i learned the kid was 17 at the time of their little affair via the news. a detective came to her house and she admitted to every accusation, and i'm afraid she's going to be imprisoned for a long time, possibly over 10 years. this is when i lost all hope and became suicidal again.

what was the point anymore? the one i basically devoted my life to (aside from my parents and blood sister) had committed numerous sex related felonies, hid it from me, and lied to me when i finally heard the ""truth."" then, to top it all off, even though i can forgive her (though trust me, it'll be a while), she's almost certainly going to prison. she's suffered enough for this dumbass mistake. she lost her job and is never gonna be able to teach again, she's gone through a whole lot of shit ever since the affair ended (her blood mother died, she was raped twice and repeatedly sexually harassed by someone with power over her) and i believe it's been beyond enough to atone for her bullshit. but, despite what i think, she's probably gonna be gone for a long time. and i don't want to live without her.

tl;dr: my ""soul sister"" was convicted of fucked up sex felonies and not only hid it from me but lied when i did find out. to top it all off, she's probably going to prison for a long time. i dont want to live without her. and because of that i don't want to live.

Really starting to get this “learned helplessness” thing.,"My parents know that I’m depressed. Not suicidal. But “depressed”. Their very first snap reaction to me telling them was to say that it’s because I’m on my phone too much. Which is super funny. Actually. Eventually they let me know they would help me find a therapist. Still working on that. Hard to find one apparently,
So even though I’m *admittedly* in a very fragile mindset and experiencing dark thoughts, my parents will still tell me about every single thing I do and am that bothers them. Even though I’m struggling and some of the things are a direct result of that.
For example,  I did something that my mom found annoying, that my dad did as well. My mom never confronted him at all, told me that she was annoyed with him but “didn’t want to deal with him” so didn’t mention a word to him. But she laid into me. Even brought up that she doesn’t want to make me feel bad but felt like she needed to be heard by me anyway. I completely over reacted and broke down crying, which surprised her. And embarrassed her because we were driving to go pick someone up and now I was crying. I don’t know how she is surprised. I’m literaly, depressed. And not treated for it yet.
And tonight I was a little drunk and ended up admitting to my dad that him and my mom were the only things I was living for, the only things in my life that I was staying alive for. He had no reaction. Just kind of muttered about that being “stupid”, but no real reaction. Then changed the subject.
So I haven’t been sleeping. Like the past 4 weeks there have been 2-3 nights *every single week* that I haven’t slept a single hour. Just pulled all nighters entirely. And it’s really been dragging me down into some crazy darkness I’ve never seen before. I’ve told my parents this. In the past my doctor told me that if my sleeping issue gets worse that she is going to have to put me on some pretty serious sleeping meds. So tonight I let my dad know that I’ll probably be put on those in October when I go to the doctor. And he didn’t show any concern at all, all he showed was *annoyance*. He told me that if I worked really hard during the day then I would sleep just fine. I told him no…that’s not the case. I’m not sleeping in a much more extreme way than just, not being tired. He told me if I got up early and then worked the entire day and night that I would sleep just fine, I pointed out that last year for 8 months I worked 2 jobs, and would get up for 6am shifts and would work either til 9pm or 11pm, and still struggled with sleeping. Which he knew. And he huffed and asked if I did that for “20 years”? And…no I did it for 8 months. But I struggled sleeping. He huffed that I wouldn’t know until I did it for 20 years. By that logic I wouldn’t have any right to complain for a very long time. Since I’m 23 and have only legally began able to work since I was 16. So, about 8 years I’ve ever even been able to work. Maybe he’ll take me seriously when I’m 36? I told him that I always ended up regretting telling him the things I struggled with because he always found a way to downplay them or make them my fault. And he walked away and went to sleep.
I really truly wonder if I took my life in this bedroom and they found me tomorrow would they wonder if they were somewhat at fault for not taking me seriously, or would they act as if they had no clue I was struggling. If they would regret snapping at me for stupid things. For hearing that I’m not sleeping and not caring. For hearing from my own mouth that I hate myself and instead of helping, doing their own work to tear me down more. To seemingly agree that I suck. I’m so sick of asking for help man. I’m so tired.

I can go to therapy, talk to a therapist sure.. But nobody want to hear me talk about my “bad experiences in therapy” and they insist there are better ones out there without fully understanding the hurt that comes alone with breaking that trust..

It’s like I’m a second-thought to everyone.. people hear that I have a problem and they deflect it as soon as they can onto someone else.. nobody cares about me.. why should I?

I keep thinking about killing myself, but I’m not sure I even want to… I want help and to get better.. but I don’t even know what “better” is… I’m so misguided and poorly raised... I feel like I’ll never survive on my own unless I fix this stuff as soon as possible.. 

I can’t do it alone anymore.. I’ve already went through my trauma alone.. I don’t want to have to deal with it alone too.. not in a world where everyone around me FUCKING preaches about “kindness” and “being there for others”… it’s sickening… especially knowing they know, and they still do nothing…

It’s too much for me alone… as I said.. the trauma itself is too much… but then!! to meet this amount of opposition when I try to get help????? It’s crushing… I’m not usually one to take “the easy route”… but it’s becoming more and more tempting lately… and I think about it more and more every day this all goes on..

I tried to reach out so many times.. only to be ignored and forgotten… I don’t know what I need at this point.. maybe a hug. But you guys can’t do that… so..",ThrowawayMe002,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgde1w/im_so_fucked/

CW: CSA, violence, pedophilia

I'm 22m and have been depressed and suicidal since I was around 12 years old but have had anxiety since I was very young. I've known I would be the one to take my life as long as I can remember.

I'm not sure when but when I was probably around 5 or 6 I was sexually assaulted by a few teenage girls which I never told anyone about and seems to have left me with serious issues.

I remember seeing bras at the store and wanting them for some sexual reason I didn't understand because I had no clue what sex even was. Everything about it seemed to interest me though. I remember my parents watching a crime show and there being a girl who was abducted and tortured and something about it seemed to excite young me.

I wound up discovering porn on the internet around middle school and quickly became obsessed with it. I don't know if it's a normal reaction for most children but I wanted to know what my peers looked like naked or having sex and searched often for that type of content. Thankfully I never found anything.

Unfortunately though I never seemed to grow out of that interest and still the idea of seeing a minor sexually interests me. I feel disgusting for it and know that it's wrong. I tried sating my desires for it with fictional depictions but never felt truly satisfied. I hope I would never act on it but I'm always fearful of losing control of my mind.

Recently my thoughts have become more violent too as my brain struggles to cope and deal with complex emotions. Girls make me feel angry a lot of the time. A mix of jealousy that other people can have sex with them and that they get to look so cute and attractive. Recently I've fantasized about even taking the lives of some of these girls.

I don't even know what I'm writing anymore. I just need to get things out of my head. It's hell being stuck in here and I just want this to be over.

"Life is frustrating and nothing has gone right, despite all the effort I've put in.","I want to die so, so badly. I've been plagued with mental illness my entire life one way or another---I had severe OCD as a kid, which ruined my childhood. All I could think about were rituals, how I could avoid certain things, and how to hide my compulsions. That eased up when I got older, but I've always been deeply depressed. Four years ago, I developed PMDD, which is PMS x100. Every month, I feel hopeless, suicidal, anxious, I'm angry, I'm impatient (the last two qualities are not a normal part of my personality). Im pretty sure I lost some friendships because of my deep depression. I'm lonely as fuck. Last year, my boyfriend, who I lived with, broke up with me because I gained weight during the pandemic. He was so fucking mean to me after he broke up with me. We lived together for a month after, while he was looking for a place. And he treated me like shit. He also went on dates off of dating apps while still living with me. And I was still in love with him (I'm definitely not now). He thinks I don't know. He got into a new relationship three months later and he looks so happy in pictures he's posted on instagram with her (I've since blocked him). That hurts because I remember being sad he didn't post any pictures on instagram of me when we were together. People always bring up ""karma"", but it's not real. If it was, he would be miserable, for what he put me through (some of which I didn't mention here), and I'd be in a happy relationship.I ended up losing almost 30 pounds last year, after he broke up with me. But a doctor had me go on birth control to help my PMDD and I gained it all back last November. I'm having trouble losing it again.  I don't want him to know anything about my life because I'm so fucking lonely and I weigh the same now as I did when he broke up with me. I feel so pathetic. 

After that, I essentially lived alone for months. My parents very kindly bought a place where I live so I could rent from them---I had to move three times in three years, the first place was because my landlord was selling the place so I had to leave, which I had a hard time with because mentally, I can't take instability. I pay them market price for rent, more than I've ever paid for rent. It's not a free ride, which is totally fine. They bought a two bedroom because living alone makes me suicidal. I was so excited to get a roommate and have someone to talk to sometimes. But I ended up with this guy who I cannot connect with at all (and I call strangers for my job all the time---not a telemarketer---I'm good at talking to all sorts of people). It's just so awkward when we interact, and he's gone a lot anyway. I'm extremely resentful of him, especially because he makes these odd noise complaints--I had to work on a Sunday so I microwaved oatmeal at 6am, and because it was his day off, he came out and complained----I opened the door before it went off and made sure to be quiet. He leaves at 6am on weekdays for work, but I don't complain because I have a roommate who needs to live their life too. I had to watch a tv show and take notes on it for work and I was in the living room at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and he TEXTS me, from the next room, to turn the tv down. It wasn't on loud---the narrator was louder than everyone else so I had to turn it up a bit. A few hours later I apologized (not sure why, its a reflex) and he said ""I realized that maybe the noise was coming from the pool area"". He didn't apologize, and if I didn't send that text, he probably would never have admitted the pool thing. I'm not a loud roommate in the least bit, but he'll incessantly use the washer and dryer---a few weeks ago, the dryer going off woke me up at 3am.

 But honestly, if he did all that and we actually had a friendship and talked some times, none of that would matter to me. I can't ask him to leave without anyone else lined up because my mom will yell at me and guilt me, like she always has. But his presence is making me depressed as fuck. I resent him because I wish this spot was filled by someone I could talk to sometimes. I work from home, which is isolating, so I'm alone all day and all evening every day. 

This is honestly just a little bit of why I'm depressed. If I wrote everything, it would take up more than the character limit, I'm certain. I had two grandparents die in less than a year, I was sexually assaulted last year, a guy I liked a lot, who I met last October and had regular contact with, told me he didn't want to hook up anymore, and wanted to be friends without benefits, which was shitty but okay, I have to accept that. He hasn't texted me for more than a month now though. A lot of my friends moved away during the pandemic. It's been harder for me to leave the house after the pandemic, psychologically. I don't know how to make new friends here. The PMDD is actively killing me. I tried to kill myself last year because of it. I don't have any control over anything, but I'm fully aware its happening. It's like this person who isn't me is in my body with me, and they're making decisions and saying things, and they're much stronger than me so I can't fight them. 

If I just had someone I could actually have a household with and sometimes maybe we can watch a movie or cook dinner together, I feel like that would help. I don't need them to be with me 24/7. I like and need alone time. But this is too much alone time, and it's genuinely driven me insane. 

I know this all pales in comparison with what other people have to deal with, which makes me feel like an asshole. I tried so fucking hard to fix everything in my life after it fell apart during the pandemic, and I essentially have made no progress. I wish people in my life knew how fucking hard I've tried. I'm sorry this is all over the fucking place. I have truly lost my mind because of all of this. I just want to fucking end all this pain and suffering. I'm tired of people treating me like shit. I just want to be free from my fucked up brain. I'm so fucking frustrated that nothing has gotten better in over a year, even though I tried SO hard to make it better. I wanted so badly by this time to be thinner, to live with someone I enjoyed being around, in a happy and loving relationship, with a fair amount of friends. I told myself last year everything was going to be better by now. What do I do? Just say everything will be better by this time NEXT year? How many years am I going to keep doing that without seeing improvement?",catsinspace,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wggur4/life_is_frustrating_and_nothing_has_gone_right/
CW: suicide and details of it,"I’m finally at that point again. Tomorrow I will be getting an eviction notice because I can’t do anything right like simply working to have general things I need to have to live an average life. My therapist gave me a list of organizations I can call that could help me cover the rest of my rent so I don’t have to get evicted. But if I can’t find one to help me tomorrow I’m just going to end it. I don’t ever like asking for help because I don’t want to keep being a burden. So asking for help with my housing situation feels so stupid because I’m just taking that away from someone who actually needs help because they want their life. 
I feel bad though because that means my family or someone else will have to go through all of my belongings to get rid of them from my apartment since I’d be gone. Making them have to do that feels shitty but if I’m dead it’s not like it even matters. I don’t even have anything to give away because the only thing that mattered to me is gone. Plus I know my cousin would love to have my cat because he really connected with him and wants a cat anyway. As for my other cat, no one knows I even have him so he’d probably end up at a shelter but he’s such a pretty cat that I know he’d find a loving home pretty quickly. His breed is sought after. Plus maybe selling all of my squishmallows and other electronics will help cover some of the costs of my death. I’m just over it, I can’t seem to stop sabotaging myself since forever. Plus I have people that hate me so much they’d love to see that I killed myself because that means they won. But really it’s me who will have won. I never thought I’d be alive this long. I didn’t ever want to be alive this long. But here I am. I don’t want to live on this planet surrounded by disgusting human beings who don’t give a fuck about anything except themselves. Even if that means killing our earth and putting other people down. As long as they get money that’s all that really matters. Because then they can experience cool things and make good memories. I don’t want that though. I’ve never wanted it and it just feels so stupid to me. I never understood the appeal of living life by doing things that make you happy! Having children, making all of these great things. In the end everyone will die so why is it so bad for me to want to leave on my own accord? Say I went to a hospital to get help, I’d still lose my apartment and my job and my family would still have to pack up my belongings. And after that? They’d be happy I’m here but still disappointed that all the help they gave me didn’t do anything to make me want to live and do better. They’d have to take care of me again even though they can’t. I will always be a burden because I can’t do shit on my own because I don’t care enough about myself to want to help myself. And they can’t change that. I don’t think anyone truly knows how dark my brain has been since I was born. I’ve done everything to be this perfect person so that my family would be proud of me, but that’s just not me. And i can’t keep doing it anymore because that’s all I’ve ever done my whole life. I don’t have any fight left in me and frankly i don’t care enough to appease them anymore. I’m just done.

I have really bad ideas in my head.,"I don't know what to say. I'm just gonna word out what I'm thinking. I've been having really bad ideas in my head for the past 3-4 months. It all started with this bad break up, which I really don't wanna to talk about much. Since that point, my entire life is just going down the fucking toilet. I am 18 years old, studying computer science, and I'm really failing it. I lost my faith in god a long time ago. I don't want someone to convince me that there is one, it's just over for me. 

Sometimes I just go out of my room and stand on top of the roof, and look down. Yesterday I wasted 30 minutes walking in a circle on the roof top. I just wanted to jump off and end it all. I don't believe in an afterlife, I am not afraid of death at all. I'm just afraid that I will survive the fall. My family loves me I guess, but it's just something that keeps holding me back. I don't know. I don't eat, I don't sleep. I just spend most of my day doing something randomly. Sometimes It's on the computer, other times It's just walking outside or hanging out with my cousin. Then I go back home and I jerk off to sleep. Today, I got out of bed and got berated by my parents for a reason I don't know. Had a rage and I hurt my self.

I keep getting ideas of doing something bad to someone. Sometimes I wish I had a gun. Sometimes I get intrusive thoughts. I don't even know if they're intrusive. They are all just violent thoughts. I just want to do as much damage as possible. I just don't know why. I recently had a break down. My whole hand just hurts me, punched a window yesterday and got cut.

It just feels like no matter what I do, I will never be happy. I will never find someone who will love me. I will never become someone. I have a few friends at university, and they all think I'm funny, but I feel like none of them even care about me. It's like I'm just a jester or a clown to amuse them.

It’s been such a struggle but I’ve continued because I had hope of a brighter future for myself. Well, 4 months ago I lost my job. Now I can’t find work, my mental health is suffering because I can’t afford to see my doctor. Not that it would be all that helpful since I can’t take my meds if I don’t eat, and I don’t eat when I’m depressed. So it creates a spiral.

I’ve kept going because my life continued to look up. Now I’m under qualified for anything but retail apparently, I’m facing bankruptcy, and the struggle to keep trucking on feels like daily torture. I’ve dealt with depression a long time, but I’ve never been this close to the edge.

A lot of my family have died and I’m still pretty young, the remaining people are getting old or are ill so I guess I’ve always figured I’ll just end it when they’re gone, but right now I’m feeling like I can’t wait

I live with my ex and for a year we’ve gotten on well like that, but I’m pretty sure they’re moving on and that’s ok that’s what exs do but I have BPD and it’s just hurting me

I’ve tried to grow and be a good person I just know deep down that I’m not. I’ve hurt people with what I say. I’m generally seen as mean and standoffish so I don’t have many friends. It never bothered me much because I’ve always had this vague notion that I’d kill myself at some point.

I attempted before but I was young and it didn’t work. People say it was a “cry for help” which I guess at least it did get me help for while but that wasn’t what I wanted, I just wanted to be gone. Therapy and meds have never fully worked for me. I’m so jealous of people who say it’s “life changing”

I don’t want to be seen as attention seeking or crying for help. I don’t want any attention I just want to be gone.

I want to kill myself to prove to my mother that I’d do it,"The sentiment is stupid, I get it. For context, I’m in college now, and I’ve been suicidal since before I was a pre-teen. I’ve asked my mother for therapy or some sort of mental health help over the past few years, but it’s been less than fruitful. She mocked me and guilted me and shamed me for ever saying it. She got physical with me the first time I told her I wanted to kill myself. She also blames me for feeling suicidal, because she claims that she’s given me “solutions” (she’s crunchy and her solutions are herbal supplements and standing in the sun). The past few days, things had been tense between us, and it boiled into a screaming fight tonight, where I told her I was really going to kill myself tonight. She obviously didn’t believe me, which is probably the worst part. This isn’t a “boy who cried wolf” thing either; I’ve never said that before. Killing myself to get “revenge” would be shallow and stupid and hurt the people that actually care about me, but I’ve grown to hate her so much, it’s consuming me. I feel like I’ll finally prove my point if I do it.",ghostfacedgf,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgj18v/i_want_to_kill_myself_to_prove_to_my_mother_that/

"Break Up, Mental Illness, Betrayal…","Hello everyone, I had a girlfriend who initially gave me the feeling that she loved me very much and that I was irreplaceable for her.
However, this changed over time and I became more and more the culprit in the relationship.

I really tried everything to make her feel good (she suffers from depression and anxiety disorders).

She broke up with me quite often, but often didn't mean it seriously and so the separation never lasted more than two days.

Today she did it again. I vowed never to go back to her if she does that again.

Now I'm laying in my bed crying and I've taken 4.5mg of Xanax.

I feel like I'm worthless again for putting so much effort into this relationship.

I have had the passing thought of self harming just so someone would make me get admired so maybe I am kind of a risk, but idk.

I’m certain I’m going to commit suicide eventually because I’ve gone this long without sexual/romantic experience.,"Edit: I should add…I was very social as a child but because of my emotionally abusive and neglectful home, my social skills got hurt pretty badly. So I missed many opportunities during high school and general teen years. And college. Crucial opportunities. It’s not just about “never having sex”. I also do care about a lot of other things in life.

M 22

Do not tell me 22 is young. Have some empathy. I’ve been a romantic and sexual person since late elementary school. Then it was ripped away from me by me being forced to live in a emotionally abusive and neglectful home (and some other reasons). I went through 4 years of high school and 4 years of college and I’ve never been in a relationship nor had any sexual experiences. And I had to watch everyone else get those experiences. It’s so alienating and disorienting. It’s extremely painful. I’m extremely touch starved.

Throughout all of human history, the vast majority of teenagers become sexual with each other. And now I will never have that experience. It’s different when you’re a teenager and you can experiment. It’s a different experience, and now it’s forever gone.

Now for the rest of my life, I’m going to be labeled as a late bloomer. I don’t want to be a late fucking bloomer. Even if I get these experiences in the future, I am still forever going to be the person who went through his teen years and 4 years of college without even having kissed someone. Or being in a relationship. I want to be a person who has had sexual and romantic experiences as a teenager. But I can’t. And I’d rather kill myself than go through life without those experiences.

Just look at this post/comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/wg3l2w/sometimes_im_silenced_by_the_things_my_daughter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Talking about how teens are horny and will always find a way to fuck. It’s true. I can’t relate to anything in that thread and I NEVER WILL. I don’t want to live that life.

Now look at this: https://t.snapchat.com/t1ikZY0J

Yeah just twist the knife. I have to look at actual teens who are dating talk about their sexual relationships. I WILL NEVER relate to this. I want to kill myself just thinking about it. It’s so normalized that teens have sex, yet here I am at 22 and I know nothing of what it’s like.

And before you tell me that this is just the internet, please educate yourself on the actual rate of relationships and sex among teenagers. Also I have my own experience seeing all the kids I went to grade school with have these experiences.

I'm told constantly by my family that I'm a piece of shit, that things would be better if I wasn't around etc

telling myself not to do it. over and over don't do it. so I'm paralyzed with anxiety over it.

Sacrifice your dreams because you can't really afford them. Stick it up to your boss if you want a chance at a promotion.

Now get married, get kids and teach them the same. I say fuck it


I just accepted my first actual job offer. People say I am lucky. Lucky for what? Working 12 hours a day probably for the rest of my life? Nah I am not doing it.

I am done running. Life takes too much than it gives. I don't understand why should I stay. We are all going to die anyway, then why struggle until you die naturally?

I need to join in a month and it's killing me that I have no choice but go. I am broke and the job is 'pretty good' according to friends and family.

So guess what? I am done. Life isn't beautiful and it isn't free. If I need to work that much just to afford a living, fuck it I don't want it.

I have a 15 storey building near me and that's where I am jumping from. I hope I don't survive. It might take a few days until I gather the courage because I am a FUCKING pussy and pussy out when I really go out and try. But the frustration is too much this time so I hope I do it.

"Random vent type post, not important","Idk what I’m doing. Oversharing on the internet, I suppose. Normally, I don’t like to say “suicidal” like I don’t say “self harm” even though that’s basically what it is, but I’m still posting here. I have a very privileged life and am not mentally ill, so not sure what’s up, brain. However, I feel as though life is just kinda not worth it even if you have all that you need and more. I know this is stupid and I should be grateful and use what I have to help others, but I’m too lazy I suppose. Like, selfishly, I don’t want to work all my life and say “I wish I was young again, when I was only slightly miserable”, you know? Why do I even exist? I’m clearly not helping anyone, and if I am it doesn’t make up for everything else. I am wasting my “wonderful” life and resources. It it painful to think, some random poor kid would love this and I’m just sitting here being useless AND not even enjoying it. Like bro, I shouldn’t even exist. Someone else take my place lol. I know I am too cowardly to ever make an attempt on my life, but I still fantasize about it. I don’t even know what death is like though, I just conveniently imagine my version where I don’t exist and my family is glad I’m gone. I’m so worthless. I sit around hitting myself and telling myself to be better but never doing it. Universe, please wipe me from existence, it’s for the greater good.

P.S. I don’t care that that’s just life being unfair mother. If that’s true I don’t want this. I’m supposed to just suck it up but I’m weak and I can’t.

Of course co workers started questioning what's wrong, but as you can understand, I cannot tell them these things, nor to my friends. Today I've watched a movie, there was a scene where a guy hang him self and I've started thinking that maybe in my case, that wouldn't be such a bad idea.

I want to be loved,"It's all I've ever wanted. I want to feel close to someone, I want to be able to trust someone. I dont trust easily, in fact I don't trust most people, I hate almost everyone without even getting to know them, the few people who I do like I tend to make space between us, I idolise them, only to then make myself hate them when they do the slightest thing wrong, I also tend to take everything to heart. I don't make friends easily because of my judgemental and often shy appearing personality so I just try desperately to fill the evergrowing void in my chest. I can't even hold a proper conversation, I'm disgustingly awkward, I can barely ever string together more than a couple sentences and even then I struggle severely. However, as much as I hate and struggle talking to people I crave love and affection, it's something so foreign to me. My parents never said ""I love you"" or hugged me growing up and I think that a part of me feels very emotionally and physically neglected. I hate physical touch, I hate the thought of someone touching me yet I cry myself to sleep most nights wishing someone would just hold me in their arms or hold my hand. That's another thing, I've never held hands with anyone before, I've never kissed anyone before, the most I've done is an awkward almost hug but not quite. I think I'm just severely touch starved. I imagine the warmth from someone else's hand, must be so comforting, must feel so safe... I wish more than anything that I could have someone who loves me. Unfortunately for me I seemingly can't have platonic nor romantic relationships. As the days go by I can see everyone start to hate me more and more, my friends become closer and I'm left behind just desperately trying to catch my breath. I can see it in their eyes when I talk to them, I can see the pure boredom in their eyes reflecting my face. They're not bad people, I'm just boring. I'm still in the ""main group"" I still get invited places but I always feel so alone, they're all just so much closer to each other. I try so hard to be funny and make everyone think I'm fine but it gets harder to keep up that facade. I'm so very tired of this, I'm tired of constantly feeling on edge, I'm tired of always pretending to be happy. I miss the person I used to be. I miss being obsessed with a TV show or movie and telling all my friends about it, I miss having hobbies, interests and passions, I miss being able to simply be happy. I wasn't always happy, I felt sad, angry, upset, embarrassed too, just like everyone else but back then I wasn't being constantly drowned in a pit of sorrow and self-pity. Back then I had the energy and social skills to talk to people and make friends, go places, etc... everything deteriorated so quickly.",Flint_rotten,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfyji1/i_want_to_be_loved/

Paper mache world,"When I'm down everything seem so unreal. 

The world looks like a theatre stage and all people are cardboard cutouts.

The housing apartments are just layers of different coloured cloths and the cars on the roads are of paper mache.

Often it's hard relating and empathising with people because they seem fake.
Their dialogues are all made up by some bigger otherworldly being, or by aliens aiming to control my life. 

Sometimes I feel like they're listening to my thoughts through the bigger fake vans, listening to what music I currently have playing in my headphones, switching through my different thoughts like a radio channel.

Sometimes I refrain from going outside to avoid them.

Often I feel like a husk of paper mache too. Everything is boring, tasteless, pointless. I can't relate to people, I can't feel their emotions or feel happy or sad for them. Even music and art has gone stale now. 

The more I live on the more my body embodies the paper mache, and blurs physical pain. I used to hurt myself physically and sexually to feel real and convert my negative emotions. 
Now I won't even enjoy that anymore.

We are trying to move out of country and the stress / pressure is weighing so much on me. He can be rude and hurtful with his expectations and words. 

I hate my job and career. But to change into something I love comes with a massive pay decrease. Not to mention the cost for new schooling. 

I hate the person I am. I feel weak and afraid of everything. COVID has taken so much away from my life (or the fear of it). I rarely see friends, I don’t have family around, and we won’t travel or go to restaurants or anything that used to bring us joy. 

Now that brings me to the existential fears surrounding global warming, monkey pox, or other viral diseases. 

All I feel like doing is never waking up and never feeling this fear, sadness, pain, or anxiety again.

I just want it all to stop.",chase7687,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wgkcm6/too_much_pressure/

I don't want to work for the rest of my life,"What the title says. Started a new job that's pretty physically demanding and will undoubtedly do permanent damage to my knees for less than a living wage. working 40 hours a week. No consecutive days off.

I don't want to do this for the rest of my life let alone the rest of the year. I could find another job but it's still the same shit. Seems like the only other option is suicide.

I almost jumped off a bridge,"A couple years ago i I was a mess. I didn’t have a job, lost my gf, lost my car, and just mainly always had this underlining feeling that life was always going to be uncomfortable so I made the decision that I would kms after one last night with my friends.. I was smiling and joking with them as if I wasn’t going to kms right after. So the night ended so I was thinking of ways to do it first thought in my head was that I didn’t want to do it in my house cause I have nieces and such so I told myself to go to the bridge on the other side of town. I got to a bridge and decided to kms there. I’ve always been obsessed with planes and such and thought this would be a poetic way to die so then I climbed the rail with my hands holding tightly to the bars thinking about how shitty my situation was and that it would all go away in a min or so then this black Altima drives up and stops rolls their window down and looks at me and doesn’t say a word just stares at me and drives off. I start getting teary eyed and started thinking of my nieces. Like if I do this is this going encourage them to do something so dumb. I was only 19 at the time too so I started thinking of all things I’ll be missing out on so I stepped off and walked home with so much guilt that would just end my suffering and add some to there being.

I am currently looking to move out as soon as possible but I just began working a job and am trying to get out of a financial crisis.

3 months clean down the drain has really made me think.

I don’t know why cutting is such a looked down upon method of self harm. Smoking and drinking yourself away are just as bad. And you could do both of them in public without a single person batting an eye. Cutting though- it’s like suddenly, almost everybody cares. 

For me, my cuts are a reminder that i can feel pain- physically, not just mentally. They are a tangible way that I can look at the cuts on the inside of me. *Deep* cuts in my mind, my heart, my being. It’s not something melancholic. I don't want people to feel bad for me if they happen to see them. They’re just reminders that I’m *alive*. 

Same as starving myself. The feeling I get when I haven't eaten in days grounds me to this earth. It's what keeps me going. I can't help but think that if I stop- if I somehow stop feeling the bite of the knife and the emptiness in my stomach that I won't be able to handle being without them.

nearly 10 years and I'm still here.,"When I was 15 I attempted suicide the first time. Had suicidal thought first at 14. Now I'm 24 in a few weeks.
I have BPD along with other disorders and a long mental health history that I don't fancy going over, I'll put it this way so you have a idea,  I forgot how many time I tired to end my life over the last decade and I've tired every therapy available to me. So you would think ""ah well done me I survived it la la lah""... nah I'm still suicidal but I'm scared my attempt would fail agian. 

I lucky enough to have people who care deeply for me which I have felt and do feel horribly about leaving but I wonder if maybe life isn't for everyone. Some of us are just not ment to ""make it"" but then you could easily agrue that those who survive cancer, illness, suicide are meant to ""make it"" purely just from surviving whatever burden them. 

Also can someone go through a life forever more suicidal? And it just always be there in the background like the mental memo to brush your teeth? Or does it fade with age? 

I'm scared of the next phase of life. House, marriage, children... if I dare. I know it's normal to be apprehensive about the future but on one hand I could let it go and pass away and then on the other I'd love to see it. Black and white thinking gets ya good.

But my fucktard friend that I went shooting with forgot i always run +1 and the glock didn't have one chambered either.

But it has just hit me what I did, I've been fine for a long time, I have no reason to want to do this. I love my live, family, and friends.

I’m stuck,"I’ve posted to a few other subreddits about my problems and I’ve gotten not a single and straightforward answer. The amount of times I’ve been in my room just bawling my eyes out wanting to be “free” or at most, “put out of my misery”, is more than I can count.

I’m trying my best to keep it short and simple, I apologise if I’m not the best at it. I’m reaching here for help as I can’t keep venting to my partner or mother. Both have recently been diagnosed with depression and I don’t want to put the extra weight on my shoulders.

Not only am I jealous that both of them know “what is wrong with them”, but it makes me feel more hopeless and I’ll always be broken. I’m to scared to self harm again, and I’m too scared to take my own life. The guilt that would be surfacing moments before would stop me. I feel like my foggy brain has an entity inside and it’s feeding off negativity. It’s about to burst or at-least take it’s anger and sadness out on others.

Please. I’m begging you here, I really need some help. I want to get to the bottom of said problems, even if it’s one at a time. Help me.",RestaurantNervous200,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wg9aeg/im_stuck/

On a dirt road in the middle nowhere.,"It's the middle of the night and I'm parked on the side of some rural dirt road in the middle of nowhere. I've been driving for a while and I'm tired.

I've been feeling very low and needy but I can't even get some reassurance from my partner. 
""Can we hang out on the weekend?"" I ask.
""We'll have to see, maybe"" they replied.

Without turning their head away from their laptop screen they'll also say with an exasperated tone: ""I don't know how to help you there"" and ""I am not a psychologist"" or ""these things your talking about are too heavy right now"" or ""I'm tired of reassuring you"".

What am I supposed to say to get their attention anyway? ""Hey, I'm thinking of killing myself! NOTHING seems to be tying me to this world"". That's what I want to say but I don't because that'll be considered emotionally manipulative. So I won't say that to them, I'll just say it here where I won't be judged, I hope. 

I need human CONTACT but I can't seem to even beg for someone to spend time with me. I wonder if I could instead pay someone to do that...? I have money. How pathetic am I?

"Life improves and continues, but I still want to die.","I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for over half my life now. I’ll be 27 soon, and I’m not entirely sure I want to keep going. I’ve had so many various ups and downs, some of them rather extreme in nature, but I’ve always bounced back and am in fact still living.

I don’t like the idea of continuing to live. Every bond I make with someone ends up breaking, and life without others to share it with is just hollow, and sad. A cold and colourless existence.

I’ve had to struggle for most of my life, but now I feel like all of it seems to have amounted to nothing of value to anyone but myself, and to me, myself is not something worth valuing.

In all honesty, I’ll likely be taking my life as a 27th birthday present to myself. I am so, so very tired. I just want to sleep.

I won’t be reading comments on this post, so argue amongst yourselves if you must, but I do have a message for others suffering a similar existence.

Don’t give up like I have. Please keep fighting. It’s a colossal fucking pain in the ass, but it will be worth it for you to struggle and come out the other end as a better person.

Due to summer, I am in home until september I begin again college so I spend most of the day alone only with my thoughts, so  memories came into my mind and make me feel sick, angry and extremely sad and depressed. 

The main reasons for my depressed state is that some months ago I lost the only girl I truly loved and can't forget. Also I am trying to build income or pass the college career but I failed in some areas and my parents are not very happy with this. 

My only hobby is go to gym and lifting some weights and maybe meet sometimes with a couple friends and playing some pool at afternoons or party at night. Drinking a lot of alcohol too, only thing that make me happy for a moment.

is anyone else just ::so:: tired of trying?,"I've struggled with SI for literal decades. Throughout the years I have fought so hard and have done all the right things: medication, therapy, trying to be healthy physically, socially, spiritually, and financially. Trying to find a greater purpose. And I always just find myself back here in the end. Everything is too hard and it's a constant uphill battle with no true wins. 

Particularly right now, I feel like no one in the world really loves or cares about me, and it hurts so much I want to die. I've been going through some really painful stuff that everyone in my life knows about: a breakup and a pet who is dying, and an unfruitful attempt to find a new job, among other things. I flat-out told my family (Mom, three brothers, 2 sisters-in-law) that I was really struggling and had been feeling suicidal at times. They said absolutely nothing in response to that disclosure. 

I saw some friends I hadn't seen in awhile a couple of weekends ago, and at first I felt great about it but later came to understand that I was pretty much an obligatory invite to the one event where I saw them, and then they all hung out for a few days and had a blast without me. I know I sound childish but it really freaking hurt. 

Now, maybe the truth is that my family loves me and just sucks at being supportive, and maybe my friends do love me and it wasn't personal that I wasn't invited to the other stuff. Or maybe they're shitty friends. But I'm so tired of putting on a brave face and fighting that mental battle with myself; of once again convincing myself there are brighter days ahead. 

I just want to give up, and maybe it's not such a selfish thing. People might be upset if I'm not here anymore. But then again, no one holds back at the thought of upsetting me, so maybe it's fine to be a little selfish and end myself without worrying about anyone else's feelings.

I am an incel piece of shit,"For context: I am male, I have an average looking face, I am 20 years old, I have a feminine skinny body, I have a small dick (5.8 inches), I am short (only 5’11) and I am poor. 

I have never been that good looking man the women have loved and cherished. I have no social life and am probably autistic so people think I am weird when they meet me. I have a good family which is amazing for sure. But thats the only positive to my life.

I realised I was an incel 4 years ago and my mental state gets worse and worse each year. I have been led on for attention by some girls in the past, been so close yet bad luck happens and the worst of all something catastrophic happened to me in February this year. I lost the one woman who actually seemed to give a shit about me. This woman was amazing she was actually an 8/10 and I couldn’t believe my luck. She showed she cared and was concerned about how I never ate food. We dated then my insecurity of her ex 6’4 29 year old good looking boyfriend made me feel inadequate and the incel beliefs told me that she is ‘alpha widowed’ which means he will always be the best she ever had. Not me. I had sex with her for 7 seconds but my dick went soft due to my nerves and compulsive porn addiction. Then I went on to blow the chance and end up getting blocked by her. 

After this rejection I went further into the incel space. I continued to lose weight and the worse of all I became misogynistic and envious of women. I got jealous because I saw how every woman had men willing to have sex and intimacy with them: something I was deprived of. I also saw how women are in such high demand and felt inferior to them. I also hated how some men paid for everything in the relationship and took it in a way where I feel like women live life on easy mode (obviously I understand even with this help, life probably isn’t easy for even them as life can be shit to anyone) but I feel like if I was a woman life would be a lot better.  Luckily I am not a terrible dude. I keep to myself and dont want to be the typical hateful incel to kill innocent people. I just want myself to leave the world. 

Back to dating. My dating life would improve if I had a big dick, was 6’4, black (I feel like black men are the most sexiest to women), good looking, and had money. I know less than 1% of men are this man but I feel like thats what you need to have a good dating life as a man. Sure missing one of these traits wont mean its over. But in my situation being average it is over. 

Moving on a solution to continue to live would be: eating well, gym, staying away from incel spaces, making money, drop jealousy, becoming as best looking as possible, working on my mindset. However I feel like even if I do all of this, women wont want me as they have access to plenty of better men on dating apps.",50246439,136,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfxi5y/i_am_an_incel_piece_of_shit/

What to do?,"What to do with the last remaining hours of daylight before the inevitable self imposed doom? -
I ruined my relationship, the only person I have or has had my back basically hates me, 
I went through his phone &amp; its obv we are through.. we’ve been trying to rekindle things but it’s been only making things worse.. I finally after seeing truly how horrible I made him feel and how innately broken I am, am just done. We are basically stuck or I think he would be gone. I’ve been up all night on acid, deeply contemplating the pain of what having your heart ripped out feels like. 
Which, leads me to the next scene, now experiencing this feeling like I’m being dragged across a freeway.
He lays next to me unaware but probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear news of my findings. 
I plan to drown myself later tonight, but I have to wait till dark. Please save your hopeful comments for the next bloke. I just don’t know what to do in the mean time?  I feel horrible that I’ll just disappear without throwing my stuff away leaving just a mess but I can’t move anything as it would raise suspicions. Do I talk to him and pour my heart out about how I wish I could take everything back? Do I just go get fucked up &amp; pray till the moon rises?

I wish there was a way to truly erase bad memories.,"The first few months of my year have been a fucking write-off. Even though it's hopefully getting a little better since may, I still keep thinking about a very bad period in my life and it stops me truly enjoying things even now. I can't wait till this year is over and I just want to forget everything that happened before summer. And I'm sick of this shit, people telling me my bad memories are important and I can learn from them. Fuck that. I want to forget. All of it. I watched Eternal sunshine the other day and I wasn't a big fan of the film but I love the idea of it, just being to erase memories completely. And what I felt during the start of the year bled into everything - songs I listened to, places I'd go, and things that were special to me, how just been tainted and I can't fucking enjoy them now. Does anyone else ever get that feeling? This year I've felt tiny, insignificant, scared and pissed off and angry all at the same time.

"I am 25, feeling empty and lonely. I would like to end up my life but I can't find the courage. What would you do if you were me? Besides asking for professional help","I have been living abroad for four years, with a major focus on developing my career. Now I am 25, and I have realized that my life is empty: a lot of my old friendships are getting colder and more distant; I am a different person now and I feel that I don't have that much in common with my old friends as well as with most of my family members anymore.

My life is like a race against the clock, I don't enjoy my days anymore: it's just working. I am a freelance model, therefore I've been traveling for work constantly this year, without a real break. Whenever I wanted to take part in social events, I couldn't because I had to work or recover from physical and mental tiredness.

I'm going to start a new life in Milan next month: I'm going to attend one of the best universities in town, living on my own completely in a nice one-bedroom apartment in the historical center, but I don't feel excited anymore. I am not excited about going out anymore, I don't like eating anymore, I can't find anything interesting in many people anymore...everything is disconnected and irrelevant to me. I am going on holiday to one of the most beautiful and posh places in Tuscany this month, but I still feel stressed out about my job and life.

The only constant company that I've had this year has been myself and the photographers and models with whom I have been working lately...that's all. I am in the middle of my 20s now and wondering if I will ever make any new real friends in the future. Because I have been an expat living abroad for several years, I met just superficial people both as friends and in love as well. 

Today I have just realized that my whole life is just a spare room with nothing inside but cold. The more I get the more I want to achieve, sometimes I just want to end up my life, and, consequently, end my pain and worries. If the world is just a cold and highly competitive place to live with too many mean people, I don't know if I will ever survive.",pink_coffee97,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wg6tra/i_am_25_feeling_empty_and_lonely_i_would_like_to/

I don't want to do it in a way that hurts anyone,"I've had a plan in place for many years, where no one would be affected. Not even strangers. I was almost ready a couple years ago. Everyone was gone, there was no one left that would be concerned about my disappearance.

Then I accidentally fell in love. 

Now that's all been destroyed and here I am alone again. Even more lost and isolated and confused and broken than before, as if that was possible. But I know she'll blame herself. There's no way I could possibly make her understand that I'm not doing it because of what she did. I'm just... Going back to what I was doing before she came along.

So now I'm stuck, waiting for her to drift away enough to not notice. Wallowing in pain while I wait.

I have a garage full of my old life's shit that I have to sell this weekend. A storage unit full of my dead family's shit that I can't afford anymore. And now a van full of my shit from ""our"" apartment that I have nowhere to put but need to return the van.

I just wish I could die in my sleep of natural causes and not have to deal with any of this. I'm overburdened with responsibility to people who no longer exist in my life.

But good news! I'm very ill anyways and (part of the reason for the plan) wouldn't end up being able to take care of myself eventually. I wanted to have a plan to take care of that while I still had the autonomy.

But now I have covid! And a severely compromised immune system. I've barely slept or drank and literally haven't eaten since Sunday. Can't keep anything down. Can't breathe very well between the coughing, crying fits, and dry heaving. My fever is getting pretty bad. I still can't sleep. So I'll take some Valium and a little NyQuil. Nothing fatal, just to fall asleep... And maybe there's a pretty good chance I'll stay asleep! 

And she'll get a $33k surprise since I just opened a life insurance policy to split between her and two other people that aren't in my life.

That wasn't the plan.

I'm wondering what the fuck I did to deserve such poor mental and physical health care. 

That's the least of my issues right now as, my roommates and I were short on rent this month and the grace period is up today. I don't know what's going to happen. I asked my work for help and my boss helped me fill out paperwork for a loan. If approved  they would send the check directly to my landlord but so far I have heard nothing back about if they're approving it or not. I'm completely in the dark and unable to give or get any answers.

 If I get evicted I don't care anymore. I'm going to throw myself in front of a bus and nobody can stop me. I'm safe for now, but if I loose my home then what's the point of playing the game? Home is all that matters to me in life. I am a creature of comforts and despite my mood swings, if you lay me down on my soft cozy bed with a heating pad everything gets better.

Goodbye,"Hello i need some help, i have recently broke up with my partner because i discovered that she started seeing someone and i saw the message when she told her friend about it. 
We have been together for 5 years and she helped me get through a tough time in my life and at the same time i helped her financially for 4 and she's been staying with me and my parents for all that time. 
My depression has gotten soo much worse since we split up and i go up and down. 
In a way i don't blame her for doing what she did, i wasn't really there emotionally just because im autistic, and i have been working suppepr extra hard for the lsst 6 months just to save up money so we can move in together. 
I feel like i have been living for her for the last 5 years and i hadn't really had a personal life. 
I was so broken after she came to pick some of her stuff up that i was ready to die, and there is no day it goes by where i don't think of suicide. 
When i was with her i had no friends apart from her( my choice).
Now for the first time in a long time i went to a pub with an old friend that i started talking again and we ended up in her bed. 
It was the best sex i had in a long time but my heart wasn't in it, i just wanted to scream and cry. (I wasn't drunk, i dont drink alcohol) 
Now me and her have been talking for a week and i got the feeling that she's getting feelings for me, witch we talked about and i said to her not to, because its not worth it. Me and her know each other for years and we had fun in the past when both of us are single.
I would of forgave my ex for all shes done just because i really on her being there so much that i really don't know how to live without her. 
She told a family member that she still loves me but she can't forgive herself for what she did.
Im just sitting here contemplating on life and the only thing that i can think of is suicide( tried it twice in the past before i met her) but what is there to stop me now?
I can't feel symphony for others, i know that they will be fine without me. 
I don't know what im doing, im lost and scared and i thik that this might be a goodbye to the world;

Advice for Why a teenager who's body gave up on himself shouldn't k*ll himself," 

Hello  , I am 24 years old. Since my last depression was greatly reduced by  JP. and After all Psychiatrist help did not work. I have come to this  sub and possibly get a view from you people.

A  short story of my life  is after failing the first try on uni and  realizing my 10 years of league of legends playing did not gave me any  openings because i was bad at it. I have lost all my ego or trust in  myself. Even though i had heavy ADHD i have pushed myself through and  tried again. after failing to go into a good universty in my country . I  went into an offshore uni where i did not learn anything and lived in  poverty. After coming back into my country found a job thanks to a  family connection while working i have found out i had kidney failure on  both my kidneys. But i have believed in myself and work through it with  high medication. I had a stable life where i studied went to gym and  worked. After a year the medication ( Cortisone ) caused both of my legs  to get  Avascular Necrosis.on top of that i have developed a gaut and  as a Man who did not liked to eat any veggies and possibly throw up if i  ate it. Now i am pushed to a severe diet. Following After a 6 months of  surgery and recovery time i have lost my job and i got advised to not  lift any weights. Please do understand that i am not a hot male i and i  have an upcoming 3    [skin tag](https://tureng.com/en/turkish-english/skin%20tag)  on my face . So now that i have no jobs no skills qualified and no  natural beauty standards. I have  a very hard future that is awaiting.  On this point in my life  all of my trumps has failed and i just left a  24 years of failure behind.  I did promised myself at age 18 that i  would kms if i did not improve on life . Now that 6 years past and got  no kind of advancements in life and only worse medical status . i am  contemplating the only option. I have no future that is awaiting for me  that can make me happy nor i have any kind of dreams or options that can  make me smile. Even if i magically turned into a millionaire and got  new [kidneys.](https://kidneys.got/)   With an existing gaut and Surgecially  weakened legs i do not be using  any of my money to do things that i like. so far any things i liked is  a)turned into a severe failiure/ realised that i had no skill and passed  my prime age of doing it.   b) now due to my medical status i am not  allowed/can't do.

I  have speak this about my family and total of 1 friend but they both  couldn't said anything and just said ""cmon don't do it"" as the doctors i  have went. No one gave me a good option, hope etc. The only realistic  approach was ""you have to realize your positive things and live a life  happy with what you got"" which does not stand in any way shape or  form.Due to me not loving the idea of a ""failure who is born to fail  living in poverty with weak health status""  Since the future that awaits  after my family dies. Is an ugly, alone out of shape dude who can't  even lift/run/jump that lives so he can go to dialyses. Even if i had  these  options i would not be gaining any muscles due to kidney  failiure. And since i do live In a 3rd world country where my life means  nothing. I do not wish to continue.

At what point are you considered an 'immediate threat' to yourself?,"Thinking about opening up about being suicidal to my counsellor however not sure how much of the truth would be best to say as I really want to avoid inpatient. I have heard many people say that you won't be put in inpatient unless you are an 'immediate threat/risk' to yourself but I'm not sure what exactly is classed as this.

If I'm suicidal and have a plan and a loose idea of a date does that count as an immediate threat? I should also mention that since I'm under 18 and I've heard that this makes being forced into inpatient more likely. I do really want to avoid this at all costs as my parents finding out would be enough as it is.

"Where to post or show ""suicide note""","I wrote/currently writing a really long one, like basically just a summary of all the reasons I want to die and why I'm killing myself

I have a muslim arab family who I don't have any sort of relationship with (and would never want to), and the idea of writing one ""in real life"" is out of the window for many reasons. 

This past year has been the hardest year of my life and every freaking day feels like it's my last. Each second I live feels like I'm getting closer and closer to ending it all. And the idea of writing a ""suicide note"" (or anything similar to one) has always just been something I WISHED I could do. Because my entire life I've always just daydreamed of venting to someone about all the reasons I wanna die, and the things I wished I could say before I die, and how much I hate this world and why. But I have SO many reasons, like basically an infinite amount, so realistically I never thought of writing one.

But since I'm really really ready to just end it all, I said screw it who cares. Because even though I definitely won't express myself correctly or even fit 5 percent of the reasons I wanna die, I'm gonna be dead anyway. So why does it matter. 

Also the text is really long. Like realistically over 100 thousand characters

So yeah basically I don't know what to do with it. Help please. I don't know what to do


This is an edit but literally  neevr fucking mind. 50% of teh stuff on there is kind of political and 40% of it is why I hate people and hate this world. And peopel are gonna read it?? Makes no sense Nobody will relate or even understand me and knowing how much im fixating or eveyry little thing scared of how im saying it because I feel embarrassed maybe i shouldnt show it to anyone in the first place. I told my family im ex muslim and this ""suicide note"" thatsbasically like a mini diary i showed to my aunt and dad to try and convince them into not calling the mental hospital people thing idfk what theyre called which didnt even work and now i am quite literally stuck so even in a hypothetical situation i didnt wanna die im gonna die anyway. I havent drank water in two or three days idk at this point cuz i havent slept and in three days max ill be dead. I cant risk any other methods os dying.

Help,"I made a previous post here 2-3 years ago I'm currently 16 in that time my life has changed so much and not for the better, I've gone to rehab a little over a year ago due to my drug use (Nothing more than weed/pot/marijuana and the occasional drink) and in my time there I've realized so much about myself people there help me realize that yes drugs aren't the answer to not having to deal with my problems, I still have a lot of passive suicidal thoughts but recently (The past year and a half) I've had more and more active suicidal thoughts. 

For some back story 
My father has always been abusive physically and mentally when I was about 7-9ish CPS got involved nothing came of that but he did finally stop not because CPS because although we live in the US my fathers side of the family comes from Laos around the time of Vietnam, and they are very respected in there community and he stopped because of the repercussions that having his kids taken from him would have but he is still emotionally abusive along with my mother.

My father has lied about the abuse to CPS my family friends, my mother gaslights or tries to tell me that I always deflect the blame(For anything) onto my father because i mention his abuse in arguments and trying to get her to see how much that has affected my life. I have now realized even as a 3rd grader i suffered from severe depression/anxiety.

But more recently me and my father had a fight that stemmed from me arguing with my sister, I called him out for not doing anything beyond going to work 7-5 while my mother also works a fulltime job and doing all the house work along with me and my 2 younger siblings (15,13) I have 2 other siblings but they are 8 and 5-6, but my father complains when nothing is done and how it stresses him and my mom out while he sits on his ass and does nothing, I also go to school, have a part time job all year round and most of the time I could go to school, come home and have less than 20 minutes to take out and care for my dog, and get ready for work, then have to come home and still be expected to do my evening chores i don't mind doing all of that but he whines and complains that nothing is done while not doing anything himself. 

But during the fight I had called him a ""Lazy piece of shit father who does nothing"" and that is what triggered him to be beyond pissed and I had been holding my dog who in the first place does not like me at all while having the argument but my father had proceeded to walk and stand no more than 3 inches from me and just said ""Hit me"" he has tried that in the past so he could hit me while it being 'self defense' (He also had a camera that would show i hit him first) but the last time he did that i hit him and my mom stopped him from hitting me (At the time 13) and he told me ""Next time i will leave you on the ground in a pool of your own blood. after that i shoved him and told him to ""Step back before i do hit you"" and I went to my room and slammed the door and part of the wood trim came off (Just needed to be put back and nailed back in) and my mom came in and started to defend him i had used my body to push her out of my room and lock the door and then called my aunt to come pick me up, she showed up to my house about 5 minutes later to get me and my mom had tried to stop me and i once again used my body to push her out of the way and once I got outside my aunt was talking to my dad and i had gotten into her car and then waited for my aunt to follow but she stayed to try and get the story of what happened, no less than 3 minutes after getting in my aunts car 1 after another 4 cop cars pull up (no siren, no lights) and i told the officer what happened and included the part of his threat when we last had a fight. 

I had spent the last 3 1/2 weeks at my aunts house with my cousins occasionally smoking weed while there and 2 days ago her neighbor had texted her about a ""Weed smell"" and my cousin (Her daughter 23) asked me if i could stop and i said yes because i didn't want to cause troubles for my aunt and her family so i said i would stop and tonight (About 4 hours ago) had gave me an ultimatum of i either go home or she will call the police but not to just make me go but search the house (That would also get my aunt in trouble) even though she didn't do anything nor do anything illegal and so after about and hour of me standing in my aunts kitchen and staring at the wall (I don't talk to my parents after the fight) while my father sat there saying nothing (My mom is currently trying to get a divorce) while my mom sat there and threw insults at me and blamed me for things out of my control.

But to the point my mental health has gone down and down due to this and i have had about 4 active suicidal thoughts a day each thought is there for about 1/2 hour and has been in a downward spiral and my mom only throws some pills (Anti depressants) and basically tell me to deal with it. and i can't be here it gives me flash back (Most likely from C-PTSD) and if in honest the only thing i care about here is my dog (Different from the one earlier stated) and i'm starting to things that the only way for me to be happy is if im dead and all i want is for me to be happy but i have to live with the person who most likely is the cause of possible C-PTSD and my mom defends him all that i'm told is that im a disappointment why am i not better how i can't do anything right.

All i want is to be loved. to be happy

How do you help someone that doesn't want to be helped?,"Hey guys, I was recently told that my brother tried to commit suicide a couple of months ago, but my parents decided not to tell me about it on his request. He tried then realized what he was doing and stopped and seaked help from them. I don't live in the house since I turned 18. I am extremely worried. He finished school, he left uni, he doesn't leave the house, he sleeps during the day and played computer games at night, he is severely depressed, he has no wish for life, he has no friends, no goal in life, he doesn't work, he doesn't go out of the house, I was told he hasn't been out for more than 3 mouths. He doesn't want to speak to anybody, including me and we used to be close, he only speaks with my mum. He doesn't want help, he doesn't want to talk, and he doesn't want to do literally anything to get out of this situation. My parents have left him alone for now for him to calm down in general and not to trigger anything more. You have no idea how much I've tried to help him, to be there for him, to search for a job, to try to get him motivated to do things, I've helped him out a lot but he doesn't want to do anything. I'm shit worried, my parents are unable to handle this situation, they lack the emotional tools to do so. I don't know what to do guys. How the fuck do you help somebody that doesn't want to be helped?

PS: He refuses to talk to me, he doesn't answer my calls, and he removed me from social media. but that is not only me, he did that for everyone. He only speaks to my mum.

21st August is a farewell day where I'll meet friends that I've had the best memories with. I want to see them if before I take the step. It's also symbolic because that'll be an actual farewell for me. There are high chances that I won't do it, but if impulse is strong, I might do it that day.   

Everything is dark that day. My family will be devastated. But rather than slowly disappointing them and everyone who has believed in me, after how much I have lied, I would feel at peace by not being a burden on them anymore. If I don't do this, they will be in a different state of shock when they realise that I have deceived them mercilessly. I can't bear that. That is cruel and unjust. I don't deserve their love.

I am probably damaging my daughter.,"Been researching the effects of a suicidal parent on a child and it’s as bad as you’d probably expect. Higher rates of depression, overall worse physical health, poor academics, high rates of emotional neglect. 
My partner recently told me that they didn’t even think about suicide as an option until they got with me. That they learned this behavior and thought process from me. That means my daughter will too. 

Beyond the suicide, I’m also extremely fat. I have tried so many times and I just have no self control. I try to make sure she has healthy options for snacks and I try to make her balanced meals but how much does that matter if she sees me being disgusting outside of the table? 

I recently started self harming again for the first time in probably 10 years. Like a teenager. I’ve done fine hiding it from her but how long can I get away with that? 

I think she might be better off without me. I don’t even believe that this is “suicidal fog” or whatever.  I genuinely think that I am actively harming her and I don’t know how to stop beyond killing myself. She would be so much better off with a step parent and not even remembering me.

Since I was little I have dealt with some/several mental problems (self-harm, eating problems, anxiety and severe depression, among others) most of them have been medicated for a long time. My parents pressure me that if I get 9.6 it's not good because someone got 9.9.  if was gaining weight , if I don't do an activity  my cousin does, if I do a lot of things and that they don't have my time,if I eat or didn't eat. my friends, although without knowing it, make comments about ""I eat and I don't get fat"" or ""no OP is super judgmental "" (for saying that she has beautiful eyes) ""OP this or that"" my family compares me with my cousins ​​and demands that if I'm good at something and my cousins ​​isn't it's because I'm selfish and I don't help them enough. .there were times when I felt fine and suddenly something triggers my depression or eating problems and sometimes relapse in my self-harm. Recently during the pandemic I tried to overdose myself, it didn't work I woke up on my bathroom floor after several hours with a horrible headache very low oxygenation and heart rate I don't know how I survived. Shortly after, (a trip to the ER for my heart rate) I was almost hospitalized for my eating problems, I won't go into too much detail as it still triggers me. This was in a pandemic, I had a relapse and then I started university face-to-face, I tried to occupy myself as much as possible, which only made me about to die due to my losing weight, I had my second attempt after having a panic attack in the middle of the parking lot while I was buying party decorations with my father and I decided to stay in the car since I was still shaking and my dad thought it was a tantrum for not wanting to get out and he proceeded to tell me how selfish, embarrassing, ungrateful daughter I am
 . Recently (less than a week) I had my third suicide attempt that I almost succeeded in if it weren't for some friends (I didn't go into much detail with them) I said it was accidental and they believed me. I just can't take it anymore I feel that maybe it would be easier for everyone and for me if I died, my parents wouldn't spend money on me, my friends wouldn't have to put up with me, a few free hours for my psychologist that someone who needs them could use.

After I sold my house and resigned my career I traveled 13 countries in Europe, South America and Middle East. Until I found Dubai. During this time I use all my money in trading and forex and I was almost millionaire. Homeless but comfortable situation.

So I decide to restart here. I bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3000$ a month. Time for me to settle down a new life here.
My miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. Everything was fine until may. 
On May 14th I ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. Regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell.
I'm self taught and I worked hard to improve the system. But I found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. Impossible.Too many issues. And it's like a scam. He deliver to the clients  and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore...
I still work to found out a system that I created and able to work in the UAE. I purposed it to my boss. But he doesn't wanna change anything.
During this time I notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. Finally on July 14th I decided to stop.
Our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during August from France.
Finally today, he kept my miners (50k usd), he never paid my salary and I had to explain my daughters that I can't see them this summer.
I lost everything. I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my food, I can't pay my insurance and now I'm sick...
I'm so stupid to believe people. I've been to police but as he is local and I have no official contract there's nothing they can do.
I've been to his competitor company to tell them that I can do this system for them. They was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. But later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. The boss try to know my system I created to keep it for him and later get rid of me.
Today, I'm in a very bad situation, I keep fighting, I guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. I'm starving and I have fever now...
After one year... I really still.love Dubai. But as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode...
I swear that sometimes I just wanna give up on everything but if I'm still here it's because of my daughters.",Floda0,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wg00bs/this_is_what_dubai_is_for_me/
I feel like I'll never be happy at any job. even my dream job,"I say this because that's where I am now. My dream job. I've wanted to be a plumber for so many years. And now to be here for a month. To realize I'm not smart enough to do a job this complicated. I'm not tough enough to be around people like the ones here. I'm too different for anyone in this line of work to want anything to do with me. I'm a trans woman. And I'm not out here. But they've already assumed that I am even tho I absolutely don't pass or look female at all at work. I've gone a bit off track but my point is this. I've worked so hard. Worked through so many shitty jobs(literally) to get to this one job. My goal. My dream. And now I'm here. And I hate it more than anything. I hate that I have barely improved since I got here no matter how hard I try. It just makes me want to end everything. Because if I got my dream job what else is there? Nothing that I feel I'd want. It feels like no matter where I go I'll just be unhappy and hate my life. I spend all day thinking about how much I wish I could unalive myself. But I know I'm too scared of death to do it.

Transitioning has kinda been one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. And doing that while also trying to be the best possible employee I can be. It's all just too much for me. At my last job I could manage. I was actually good at it. But I fucked myself out of that one because I left without notice. So now my only hope is that my old boss is desperate enough for people that he'll take me back. And even then. The one person who knows my secret probably told everybody so idek if it's safe to be there anymore. I feel so trapped. Like. Either magically get better at this job and somehow magically become less depressed. Or have no job and kill myself. I know if it gets to that point that's what I'm doing. I don't wanna be unemployed again. And if I lose this job. I just. I csnt do it anymore after that. I just wish I could be normal like everyone else. And handle things like everybody else does. I wish I could be somewhere and be myself. But that'll never happen. I wish I could be smarter. But I can't. I damaged my brain so much with drugs that even after 2 years sober I can't remember shit unless it's repeated a million and a half times. I dont know what to do anymore.

I plan on kms after I turn 21 on November 23. (20F),"I just don’t see a point in doing this anymore. All this fighting my demons and for what?? Just to wake up the next day with other nonsense I have to deal with. Recently I’ve been saying the words “I don’t know what my future looks like when I’m in my mid-late 20s and 30s”- and it’s most likely because I don’t really plan on staying here that much longer. Kinda off topic, but I’m a lucid dreamer. And all i wanna do is fall asleep, lucid dream forever, and never wake up. I don’t want to be buried, I hate my body with a passion so why would I wanna be buried in it? I want to be cremated and I don’t even want my family or friends there. I’ll just hire a funeral director to that I guess. After I turn 21, I’m just gonna get high and drunk until my body can’t take anymore. I really just don’t care. 


It sucks when people who want to live, end up dying. But people who want to die and are waiting to die, they continue living. I’m literally praying that each time I get in an Uber or a Lyft, that a semi rams into us so I can avoid whatever it is I’m doing. It’s pain free after death, it’s pain guaranteed while living. I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m done.",BbgSag420,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfupof/i_plan_on_kms_after_i_turn_21_on_november_23_20f/
I changed my mind.,"Not too long ago, I had a date for myself. August 13. That was the day I would end my own life using researched methods to make sure my death was as painless and quick as possible. It was the day that I would have died alone in my house before my family returned from vacation with no one else but my dog obliviously resting by my cadaver.

A part of me still wanted to live. It's the part of me that wrote that post in this subreddit, and it's the part of me that convinced me to reach out to a friend to liberate my feelings for once. I cried. I said the reasons I had come up with to live just weren't enough for me anymore. Not hobbies. Not family. Not natural beauty. It just felt like everything was a lie or an illusion.

During that call, I was able to come up with a reason to stay alive. I could not deny the fact that suicide is a horrible thing. Yes, in some circumstances it's necessary, but in most it's not. My family had already suffered a suicide. It was my aunt's husband. He hung himself in a drunken stupor. Maybe the alcohol made his weak spot show and whatever haunted him took advantage. I don't know. I never knew him. He died well before I was born. Regardless, I knew that if I committed suicide, the trauma would reopen several wounds in my family. My aunt and her side of the family would grieve again but more viscerally this time. My mom suffers from clinical depression like me, so my suicide would destroy her. Other relatives may lash out at my parents and point fingers to cope with the pain, causing irreparable rifts to balkanize my entire family. 

I don't want to bring anymore pain into this world. There's more than enough.  I think my medication was able to help me have some sense of reason during this time. I suffer from seasonal depression ironically during the summer. The past summer was one of my worst depressive episodes ever. I did consider suicide, but I didn't even have the energy to actualize it, as grim as it may sound I was fortunate for that. 

Still, I was bitter at the world. I was bitter that people I'd try to be friends with would reveal something bad about themselves that would make me want to distance myself from them. I was bitter that I'd be singled out for ridicule, condescension, bullying, and other mistreatment behind the scenes, so that everyone else got to enjoy the beautiful persona of someone who had hurt me. I was bitter that my efforts to overcome my depression seemed to always result in going back to square one after a very short period of time. 

After talking with my friend, I was at least able to let that bitterness give me some more reasons why I shouldn't end my own life.

1. This world is full of *pendejadas* (Bullshit. I prefer the word in Spanish because it's more colorful to me), but I'm not gonna let it be my reason to end my life. Why? I don't think this world is worth ending my life over because it's a crock of horseshit, *and I'm not going to let horseshit get me to do something I shouldn't do.*
2. I have come to accept that since the world is full of *pendejadas*, I might as well let it become my norm. If I'm numb to it, it can't hurt me or haunt me. Emotional pain would become a slap on the wrist. I can manage my expectations. I can lower my standards to a reasonable extent. It'll help me appreciate the little good things that come by.
3. In a world full of *pendejadas*, there are also people full of *pendejadas*. So I shouldn't take anything personally. Not my boss, not my roommates, not my bullies, not my family, not my fake friends, no one. If I'm going to give a shit, no one is going to get it but me. I'm here to care about my own shit, my own well-being. What anyone else does means nothing. I'm just trying to be comfortable.
4. A promise to myself: The more this world tries to be cruel to me, the more I will take care of myself. It's the best revenge after all: good health. If I can't have happiness easily, I could at least make sure I eat enough food, drink enough water, maintain good hygiene, clean my room, distract myself with media, pursue hobbies, etc. *This world is apathetic to me, so I shall be apathetic about its apathy.*
5. It's very easy for me to be obsessed with something outside of myself as a distraction. Some stupid event. Some mundane person. Some worthless thing. Some useless activity. When really, I should just be obsessed with myself. What do I want to do with my life? What do I want to do for fun? What do I want to have for lunch? It's about *my* decisions. My self-care.
6. In order to fulfill this ultimate self-care, I must reduce the *pendejadas* in my life. I plan on doing so in the following ways:
   1. Keeping my social circle small and being extremely picky about who I let in and who I keep around. I will label people. I'm not going to form attachments easily. I will expect the worst out of any person.
   2. I think most humans aren't worth a relationship of any kind. So I'm not going to concern myself with finding a romantic partner (I'm aromantic any way), having children, or making new friends. I'm not closing myself off, I'm just not on the look out anymore. Forming new relationships will no longer be something I try to do (unless it's for my survival, like for work).
   3. I accept that things will never be the way I want them to be. 90% of the sex I have with men is mediocre. Many friendships I have fail because I end up overlooking how they mistreat me or they just end up mistreating me inevitably. This world will never accept me or accommodate for who I am based on my salient identities such as race, gender, and ability, at least not in my lifetime. 

I'm tired of my dramatic suffering. I'm tired of shitty humans. I'm tired of the world employing its innovative torture methods on me. I didn't ask to be here, I didn't agree to anything, and I just want to go to sleep.

I'm so tired of bottling my feelings up,"I was trying to get into a bilingual class in a school but i missed the date. they said that there is a second date in august but only if i assembled the right documents in may.  
i got into this school but not into the bilingual class. while signing the papers i saw that the list of the bilingual class was full. once again i ask if there is a chance. they say ''nope, sorry''  
so i lost all fucking hope

august came and yesterday i checked the list of free spots left in schools because i was simply curious. guess fucking what  
there was one free spot left in the bilingual class.  
i called the school (it was 2 pm) and ask them if this is legit because like????? they said yes and that i actually didn't have to assemble the documents in may. these shitheads told me several times there is no chance for me and when i lose all hope it's suddenly there? what the actual fuck

the secretary was working until 3 pm. i would have to sign the papers again and it takes like 30 minutes + i had to drive to the school first. she said that she must abide by the rules so she won't stay for me, and also mentioned there are like 60 people that too want to get into the bilingual class even if there's only one spot left

my mother told me its all my fault that i didn't look after the date, but what is the point in doing that when every single time i was told i won't get into the bilingual class? she said that I'm dumb and she cannot believe that i give up so easily  
my sibling said to me that it's also my fault that i didn't try. i rarely give up but how could i not in this situation? i just nodded at everything they said i don't want to even bother anymore  
im so tired of bottling my feelings up i feel hopeless and tired every single day and i feel like i can't tell anyone because they will just say that I'm lying  
i just want someone to tell me it's going to be okay instead of constant criticising and expecting more and more from me

So my question is, would you just want to be ghosted by the (apparently?🤣) attractive (easy)chick you have been chatting with for a while after friendly chat? or would you rather hear she is leaving and she is saying goodbye to go die alone?

I think Im failing BCA because of a very stupid mistake I dont want to deal with my stupid existence any more.,"So I answered my 1st year backlog today (I'm in 2nd year and have cleared all exams in 2nd year) so that I can pass to 3rd year. It is a relatively simple subject but i fcked up because I didn't have 3 chapters of it! I didn't even know we had it. I feel so stupid I should've confirmed months ago about the syllabus but I didn't! I thought I had all ppts. And now for this stupid mistake I will probably have to pay for by repeating 2nd year (as this was last chance). 

I don't want to repeat a year! I never failed before and the amount of scorn and disappointment I will get from everyone will probably get beyond my tolerance! I don't know why I'm so fucking stupid.

i think im not gona meke It till tomorrow,"Little backstory . Since I was little I have dealt with some/several mental problems (self-harm, eating problems, anxiety and severe depression, among others) most of them have been medicated for a long time. My parents pressure me that if I get 9.6 it's not good because someone got 9.9.  if was gaining weight , if I don't do an activity  my cousin does, if I do a lot of things and that they don't have my time,if I eat or didn't eat. my friends, although without knowing it, make comments about ""I eat and I don't get fat"" or ""no OP is super judgmental "" (for saying that she has beautiful eyes) ""OP this or that"" my family compares me with my cousins ​​and demands that if I'm good at something and my cousins ​​isn't it's because I'm selfish and I don't help them enough. .there were times when I felt fine and suddenly something triggers my depression or eating problems and sometimes relapse in my self-harm. Recently during the pandemic I tried to overdose myself, it didn't work I woke up on my bathroom floor after several hours with a horrible headache very low oxygenation and heart rate I don't know how I survived. Shortly after, (a trip to the ER for my heart rate) I was almost hospitalized for my eating problems, I won't go into too much detail as it still triggers me. This was in a pandemic, I had a relapse and then I started university face-to-face, I tried to occupy myself as much as possible, which only made me about to die due to my losing weight, I had my second attempt after having a panic attack in the middle of the parking lot while I was buying party decorations with my father and I decided to stay in the car since I was still shaking and my dad thought it was a tantrum for not wanting to get out and he proceeded to tell me how selfish, embarrassing, ungrateful daughter I am
 . Recently (less than a week) I had my third suicide attempt that I almost succeeded in if it weren't for some friends (I didn't go into much detail with them) I said it was accidental and they believed me. I just can't take it anymore I feel that maybe it would be easier for everyone and for me if I died, my parents wouldn't spend money on me, my friends wouldn't have to put up with me, a few free hours for my psychologist that someone who needs them could use. It would be good for everyone if i wasn't here anymore . and yes
For me it would be like turning off a TV suddenly dark (that's what I like to believe) I feel like it's easier just to take a knife and cut my wrists

I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live.,"Throw away account because I have family on Reddit. Basically I’m miserable. A part of me feels guilty for even considering writing something like this. For some context, I’m an 18 year old female, people would say I have an amazing life. I’ve got a big family and parents that love me so much, my upbringing was great, I’m a spoilt child, have the best support system from my family too. However I have an ED and suffer everyday of my life with chronic nausea, I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD years ago and have tried both therapy and medication along with self soothing techniques. Nothing has worked. I have had hundreds of tests done, bloods, stools, urine, fitness, gyno, I’ve seen both a therapist and a nutritionist and I’ve even done hypnotherapy. 

Long story short, i get nausea every single day, it starts the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep (if I can even sleep that night). Accompanying this nausea i have extreme stomach twitching, it’s not painful but it’s extremely uncomfortable, It makes me feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, so bad I wish to rip my stomach out. No body knows what’s causing these symptoms and they have just been pinned to anxiety which is fair enough if only I could cure my anxiety. Every day of my life I’m miserable, I lost interest in all that I used to love like my cat, reading and gaming, I don’t go out because I’m just constantly uncomfortable and nauseated, I’m barely strong enough now to even walk anyways, I have no friends anymore, all I can do is sit about and stare into space. I’m so numb to everything that I can’t even cry anymore, in fact I feel like I can’t show any emotion anymore. I don’t laugh, I don’t cry, I don’t show anger or sympathy, I can’t even force a smile. 

I’ve never had an appetite and I don’t eat a lot of food because it makes me easily uncomfortable or irritates my body, this lead to a ED diagnosis at a younger age. I’m severely underweight and lacking basic minerals to stay healthy, I survive on protein shakes and biscuits for the most part. I had seen an ED therapist for a while but nothing changed. 

At this point I don’t know what to do anymore, my parents are clearly exhausted and so am I, I don’t find the point in living anymore and literally the only think that is stopping me from suicide at this point is knowing I’d bring my parents and little siblings so much pain, even tho part of me feels like being gone would relieve the load from my parents shoulders. I see my siblings living their lives every day so carefree and happily, never having to worry about throwing up or giving out and it makes me that little bit more miserable. I know it’s not their fault and I don’t wish for them to be miserable like me at all btw, I suppose I’m just jealous of them. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this or why I wrote it but I just wanted to get it off my chest because I can’t share it with anymore else. I don’t want to tell my parents I’m suicidal, even though I’m pretty sure they’re already aware. I’m at a loss because what is there to do at this point, I’ve tried everything, I’ve reached out for help, I’ve been on meds, I even started self harming this last year just to convince myself I can still feel something. I feel horrible and am constantly reminded how good I have it, how I shouldn’t be doing or feeling this but I can’t help it anymore.

This is what Dubai is for me....,"This is what Dubai is for me...

Last year I decided to left France and start a new life in Dubai. After 22 years of careers through military, firefighter, paramedic, policeman, teacher, consultant... I decided to left this crazy, country of racists, homophobic, close-minded and aggressive to restart a new life.
In fact, I've been harassed by the director of the fire department who never accepted that I married a transgender from Philippines. I'm divorced now by the way.
After I sold my house and resigned my career I traveled 13 countries in Europe, South America and Middle East. Until I found Dubai. During this time I use all my money in trading and forex and I was almost millionaire. Homeless but comfortable situation.
Later I.lost everything because of new waves of Covid. Doesn't matter I still have a good health, my arms and I'm a genius (I mean high IQ).
So I decide to restart here. I bought 4 miners in cryptos who bring me during this time around 3000$ a month. Time for me to settle down a new life here.
My miners was hosting by a company here who make immersion cooling system for miners. Everything was fine until may. 
On May 14th I ask the boss of this company if he has a job for me. Regarding my skills he purpose me a place of lead engineer in his workshop to built the immersion cooling system he sell.
I'm self taught and I worked hard to improve the system. But I found out that the system he sell to his clients can't work. Impossible.Too many issues. And it's like a scam. He deliver to the clients  and later when the client complain he doesn't answer anymore...
I still work to found out a system that I created and able to work in the UAE. I purposed it to my boss. But he doesn't wanna change anything.
During this time I notice that he never gave me contract, visa, salaries or insurance. Finally on July 14th I decided to stop.
Our agreement was that he give me a small salary but he pays for the trip of my two daughters to come here during August from France.
Finally today, he kept my miners (50k usd), he never paid my salary and I had to explain my daughters that I can't see them this summer.
I lost everything. I can't pay my bills, I can't pay my food, I can't pay my insurance and now I'm sick...
I'm so stupid to believe people. I've been to police but as he is local and I have no official contract there's nothing they can do.
I've been to his competitor company to tell them that I can do this system for them. They was so excited and told me they hire me and create a branch for that. But later when it comes to sign the offer letter and the contract, everything change. The boss try to know my system I created to keep it for him and later get rid of me.
Today, I'm in a very bad situation, I keep fighting, I guess the next step will be to go on a red traffic light to beg for a job to survive. I'm starving and I have fever now...
After one year... I really still.love Dubai. But as alone without any connections here and no job now... it's like a survival mode...
I swear that sometimes I just wanna give up on everything but if I'm still here it's because of my daughters.",Floda0,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wg0ckr/this_is_what_dubai_is_for_me/
Thoughts gettin worse,"So back story grew up oldest of three brothers with and drunk abusive father that abused us until I was least 15 idk my parents split up we also constantly moved.
My mother is bi polar and schizophrenic. We had to go through livin with a parent that goes through that and get blamed every time she went to hospital. When they split I went with her alone so someone would take care of her. She still struggles with it to this day.  Around 20 to 21 I got with a girl that was pregnant by another man she was a family friend so we ended up falling in love when I went over there to protect and watch over. We broke up right before the child was born but got right back together and we’re on and off for 8 years the whole time her telling the kid I’m his real father. Even tho her father constantly told people at his parities and when trick or treatin I’m not really us dad. Long story short the youngest brother kills himself in 2019. Me and the girlfriend last a year after and than break up but she won’t let me talk or see the kid anymore. My middle age brother goes through a divorce at same time and loses some rights to his daughter but can still see some and least talk to her. We both have now been on heroin for last two years. I have finally been trying to convince him for us to both quit for good for his daughter and grandma. Also cause feel like we lost youngest brother to coke. He started getting really depressed off it and night killer himself he was on it. So I feel it even more wrong for me and other brother to do drugs cause they took out youngest from us. The biggest problem we live with grandma that is like our mom and she enables us tremendously. Giving us money every day and letting us use the cars. Even when we have told her not to trust us etc.

Hopefully this time she sticks by not enabling idk tho cause she said she give no one anything anymore but she still gave me money. Fortunately I actually want us to quit especially my brother cause he has the most to lose. Everytime we try to he breaks I even went to the hospital and put myself on a l2k just to quit but came back to him and his friend that lives with us using. So I started again. Anyway sorry for long sob story just hope people can wish us luck on getting clean because I’m beyond codependent on my brother I can’t lose another and be left alone. I hate us hurting our grandma tho cause she done nothing but be there for us our whole life. That’s why I feel like I’m give up on life if we don’t make it this time.

Everything feels so unnatural. Unreal. When I was a kid my mom would often express her fear of me being a ""failure to thrive"" and I worry she's right. I've been attempting suicide since I was 9 but obviously never succeeded, sometimes I'm fine others I can barely get a grip. I'm 20 almost 21 now and I have no concept of time. Months now are passing like weeks used to. Every day feels like a fight. I don't even remember huge chunks of my waking hours. Apparently I have full blown conversations with my partner that I don't remember the next day. Like make plans and shit, then I have no memory the next day. I feel so crazy and I just really want it to end. I can't end it though because my partner relies on me and if I die he would be SOL and I'd essentially ruin any chance he has at life (he's 19) 
Though a big thing that's been happening is really bad. Usually my intrusive thoughts and psychosis are about hurting me, but lately they have been about hurting other people. And it's *strong*. I just ignore the thoughts but they have been too much. Like I'm tied to a chair and my eyelids are taped open while someone shows me gorey, horrific visions of hurting innocent people who just annoy me. I can't do anything about it either. Therapy is too expensive and I can't take any time off work for my mental health either. I feel like suicide is the only option even though I know it's not a real option at all. I just don't know what to do. I want to die but I have to live to take care of others. I can't ruin other people's lives just because I can't live my own.

I’ve been able to keep suicide on hold because knew it was an option I could exercise at a later point. But since I’ve started taking my medication my life’s been falling apart gradually. I’ve gained 20kgs (45 pounds) in 2 months. My ability to lift weights has gone out of the window. I’ve lost a lot of my hair. I feel groggy and I’m unable to work or study. Seeing other people happy or fit makes me look down upon myself. I’ll have to be on medication the rest of my life and I don’t have the energy to give things a try. I’ve been on different meds in the past and I had similar problems with them. I’ve had enough and I don’t want to go on any longer.

Nací en una ciudad costera al norte de mi país tengo un hermano mayor(que parece el menor por lo inmaduro) mi mamá y mi papa que siguen juntos, yo no recuerdo pero de bebé prácticamente morí, tenía una rara enfermedad que no me permitía asimilar alimento y los médicos no encontraban motivo y mucho menos cura, mi mamá en su desespero viajo por el país para encontrar una repuesta, ya al estar casi moribundo optó por ir a dónde un brujo, me dice mi padre que cuando el brujo me vio dijo que yo moriría pero que volvería y así paso mi madre dice que deje de respirar y estube muerto 10 min y de la nada volví, dirás al leer esto que tiene que ver con mi historia un cuento tipo mágico, pues verás nunca me e sentido completo, no se si túbe una conmoción cerebral o esquizofrenia pero aveces e visto y oído cosas no deberían existir.
Tuve una infancia normal, luego de que nos mudaramos al interior del país ví poco a poco como crecía el vacío dentro de mi, mi adolescencia fue una mierda! no me hacian bullying al contrario tuve uno de los cursos más unidos y todos se defendían, yo solía ser muy sociable, pero me di cuenta que solo me usaban, todos buscamos algo en la personas pero lo que buscaban en mi solo en aras para su beneficio. Siempre e Sido aplicado , normativo e inteligente,(nerd para resumir) mi perfil estudiantil perfecto todos mi compañeros me buscaban para ayudarlos pero luego que optenian lo que querían Desaparecían.
Eso me deprimia no me sentía normal y para completar ignorado sentía que me afixiaba respirar se sentía tan pesado que simplemente dolía y en el dolor que tenía nadie lo notaba yo podía sentir el dolor de lo demás pero nadie el mío, esto nunca lo dije a adie pero en mi último año planie en sucidarme ya avía comprado el veneno había hecho lo que quería para no sentirme arrepentido de nada me puse la lista de lo que quería hacer antes de irme, decici hacerlo después de graduarme era el año 2011  ya estaba listo solo esperaba el momento de quedarme solo n la casa y hacerlo el día llegó mi hermano salió y mi mamá también y demoraría , mi papa siempre trabajando llegaría la.noche y como verán no lo hice fue allí por primera vez escuché una canción  esa noche esa canción me detuvo f**k perfect de la cantante p!nk  sentí que podía hacerlo, soportar esta horrible existencia, con mis calificaciones entre becado y enseguida a la universidad, opte por  estudiar derecho, allí perdí mi virginidad y pues si no te distes cuenta mi adolescencia fue tan solitaria que nunca tuve un encuentro sexual sea que hombre o mujer lo raro que que soy simpático, bueno mi primer amor M(soy hombre por cierto) fue el primero en verme no como el cerebrito, no como el solitario y  usable D, no solo me amo no se si sería por cómo me sentía lo acepte rompimos porque mi padres se enteraron y al hacer esto había huido de la casa el mis papás se juntaron para encontrarme luego de eso sentí que algo se había roto un poco de lo bueno que quedaba dentro de mi y el vacío volvió la verdad me consideraba gay hasta ese entonces paso un año y dejé de ser el hijo modelo a ser ireberente imponente frío y aún más calculador, pues como cliché de película eso atrae sexo mucho sexofue cuando me di cuenta de mi bisexualidad hasta que encontré a DF la mujer de mi vida y con la que vivo actualmente,  quiero aclarar algo a este punto de la historia siempre e sentido el vacío dentro de mi pero siempre me mantuve ocupado ara poder ignorarlo así es como e llegado vivo a la edad que tengo de 28 años, todo feliz con ella, tiene un temperamento fuerte pero tiene principios y ella sabe de mi pasado con Miguel, así que si es la persona que ms me conoce pero a la que quiero herir menos, hace 5 años  el vacío y mi sofocante existencia volvió a empeorar  suprimía esos pensamientos con la canción de p!nk pero ya no está funcionando, solo el hecho de no lastimarla a ella  haba evitado que lo hiciera pero estoy tan cansado, enserio tan cansado de sentirme así que la vida sea tan cruel, que ya nada me importa lo suficiente como para evitar esto
En resumen esto fue una pequeña parte de mi vida
Decidí hacerlo no por nadie sino por mi, porque ya no quiero sentirme así deseando que cualquier cosa me libre de este vacío que no puede ser llenado, cómo sabrás querido lector por lo leído que tengo metas y ambiciones cómo todos estoy esperando la entrega de la casa para que DF pueda vivir tranquila y claro que tengo un seguro de vida a beneficio de ella y mi madre casualmente la entrega a mediados de diciembre eso serán sus regalos y el morir sería el mío, DF si lees esto algúna vez perdóname por no decirte todo lo que siento, por ser tan cobarde para hacer esto que hare,  por ser egoísta al dejarte sola, por pensar en mi y en mi alivio, porque no lo concidero malo esto que hare porque por fin descansaré.

Gracias por leer querido extraño si quieres comentar hazlo me serviría saber cuentos ignoraron este post y ver lo cruel y sinica que es la vida 
Y  decir que no lo haga no lo evitará 
Solo quiero ser escuchado!

La verdad este texto me lo banearon de otro Reddit cuendo lo hicieron me senti más mierda de lo que era y dolió tanto ver lo poco que le importa l mundo lo que sientes solo quiero que esto quede, no quiero que lo borren quiero que otros sepan mi historia y porque fueron asi las cosas...",soulitarie,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfrdzv/ya_está_decidido_solo_no_quiero_sentirme_solo/

killing myself in 29 days,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't,punk3865_mid,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wftf66/killing_myself_in_29_days/
"I don't want to die, I want to kill myself","You know what I mean? Hi, sorry, just another scream in the void because where else should screams go? I don't know, this is the weirdest suicidal ideation I've ever had in my life. I'll give you some context, I suppose.


I've got my fair share of trauma. I've collected all the abuse types, so to speak. Diagnosed with BPD when I was 19, never had the ability to hold on to a job or a relationship. Whenever I found someone to give me affection my entire world would revolve around them; I'd obsess over them and if I felt like they didn't love me I would feel every nerve in my body set ablaze. It was a pain that was blinding and suffocating and it felt like the only way to end it was to extinguish my very existence. I've had kidney stones that felt like ecstasy compared to that raw, burning pain of feeling unloved. Every time I've ever wanted to die, it was a very, very active thought that I MUST die, immediately. But...


I got better for a while. I actually joked that I was the first person to be cured of BPD. I had untreated Grave's disease, my thyroid was frying my brain with a daily overdose of thyroid hormones. I never got treatment because every time a doctor tried to treat me they would sternly tell me, ""if you continue to leave this untreated, you will die."" Man, I wanted to die. I hated myself. I hated my life. I always thought, ""good, if it kills me that's one less thing on my to do list!"" So I let my brain fry like that for years. I finally accepted treatment one day because the person I was in a relationship with at the time begged me, and it was the first time I actually felt that I had a person who loved me as much as I loved them (very rare for a BPD, lemme tell ya). So I did it. I got it fixed. And holy shit. Holy shit. Bliss. 


It was a slow change. Not immediate. As my physical symptoms went away and my body was healing, my headspace started to shift too. At the age of 25 I was finally born. For the first time in my life I was able to keep a job. I was fucking awesome at my job, too. I started feeling capable. I started feeling confident. I stopped hating myself. I started... liking myself. I started loving myself. I would think of all my past suicide attempts and have these horrible panic attacks thinking that I almost missed out on all of this joy. I almost prevented myself from experiencing this wonderful life. It hurt my heart to think of my past self suffering. She deserved better. But I was happy to finally be able to give myself better. I sent myself telepathic love letters to the past; I'd think as hard as I could to please hold on because holding on will get us to here, and I love you so much, past me, so please keep being strong. I still had rough days but they were just days. I was happy. 


Then the world ended. Thanks 2020. I tried staying strong for so long. I lost my job, but I tried to be optimistic about it because I'd been feeling like I wanted something better. I lost some friends. I lost my partner. I got my first apartment and was (and still am) single. I had always been in relationships since I started dating; I was codependent as hell and I couldn't take being alone. But I learned to love being single. It's a lot easier to be alone when you don't despise yourself. I found a lovely group of friends, I talked to them every day. I had a lot of money saved up to pay my rent without working for a while. I was down. But it was just a low point. It was nothing like that searing, burning pain I used to feel. Not even comparable.


But it keeps... getting lower. I still don't have an income and it like I can't figure out how to get myself to work now. I have started attaching my worth to my crush again. My bank account is overdrafted the entirety of my rent payment this month. I'm out of money. I keep getting into these moods where I feel like my sweet friends don't care about me. They hurt my feelings sometimes and I know I feel too much. I know I'm too sensitive. But they hurt me and then act like it's my fault I'm hurt and I feel like the best thing I can do is just... Disappear. 


And that's what I want. I want to disappear. I want to get in my car. And drive. And I want to feel the tires gently start to lift off the road, getting higher and higher, miles and miles above the earth, until finally I plummet into a black hole. It doesn't hurt like acid, it hurts like Novocaine. There's no feeling at all but you know the drill is going too deep. And I just want it to stop.


I want to stop worrying about money. I want to stop worrying about being too sensitive. I want to be held. I want to feel loved. I want to vanish. I want to be seen. I want to be heard. I want to be cherished. I want to be enough. I want someone to care. I want the Novocaine to wear off. I want to feel. 


Sometimes I imagine how it would feel to drive very fast, and stop even faster, crashing my car into a tree. And when I imagine it, it feels like nothing at all. I know, I KNOW it would hurt so bad if I really did it. It would hurt a lot and I may feel pain forever. But I would feel. God, I would feel. 


Anyways I'm not really sure what to do about all that. I won't hurt myself because I can't. I care about myself too much. I know I don't want to be dead, I just don't want the life I currently have. But I feel like I will never have the one I want. It feels so out of reach. And I feel like my brokenness is so trivial compared to where I was years ago. Past me felt real pain. Past me would laugh if she heard someone like me talk about being suicidal because she'd see right through it. She'd say, ""you're not really even suicidal. You don't even know pain. You're choosing to be weak. You're choosing this."" And she'd be right. I am. But I don't know how to stop. I really don't.

I’m just so fucking sick of everything,"I’m sick of being compassionate  
I’m sick of forgiving people  
I’m sick of being the bigger man  
I’m sick of how cruel life feels  
I’m sick of how cruel people are to each other  
I’m sick of the urges I get to hurt myself and others  
I’m sick of suppressing my urges  
I’m sick of feeling ashamed of my urges  
I’m sick of feeling so detached from my friends and family  
I’m sick of pushing people away  
I’m sick of feeling so alone  
I’m sick of the agonising pain I feel when I stay completely still  
I’m sick of the boredom I feel when I’m doing shit that I’m supposed to enjoy  
I’m sick of picking up new hobbies only to ditch them not long after  
I’m sick of being a walking contradiction  
I’m sick of being so uncomfortable in my own skin  
I’m sick of acting impulsively  

For the last 3 hours or so I just stayed in bed staring up at the ceiling. I don’t even bother moving my toes or fingers anymore because the pain I feel from not doing anything gives me some comfort. It feels like it’s not even my own body anymore.

I haven’t even been diagnosed yet but I’ve been told I may have to wait up to a year for my ADHD assessment. I simply can’t fathom living like this for at least another year.  

Sometimes I think about assaulting random people in the hopes that I either get some joy out of beating the shit out of them or them beating the shit out of me. Of course, the better part of me usually realises that I shouldn’t do such things, but when I barely feel any attachment to anyone, I’m starting to think there’s no consequences for what I choose to do. 

The one thing that put me off Suicide was the effect it would have on my friends and my family. Now I don’t care anymore. I still won’t kill myself but I’ve come to realise that I don’t have any connection to these people anyway so it doesn’t even matter.",Electronic_Gold9310,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfizok/im_just_so_fucking_sick_of_everything/

Feeling like it’s the end of the world because I got a traffic ticket,"Hi. I’m new here. So, last week I received a traffic ticket for a railroad violation. I went through the railroad crossing just as the arm starting going down and the lights started flashing. I know know that is very dangerous. No one was hurt, nothing was damaged. I was obviously pulled over—on a main road (two lanes going both directions). And the police officer didn’t get out of the car for a few minutes and I wasn’t sure if he wanted me to pull into a parking lot. So I started to inch forward and the office obviously followed me—which I stopped right away and then the officer came out to talk to me. I only got one ticket and it was just for the railroad crossing, but i feel like a complete idiot and hate myself for doing this. I talked with a lawyer who will go to court on my behalf. 

But I truly feel like my life is over and I feel scared constantly. I have always had anxiety but I feel like the worst person ever and I’m so ashamed of this.

All I can think about is dying,"I’ve never been very good at talking to people. I’ve never been the worst, but I just avoid talking to people as best as I can because it makes me really nervous and anxious and I can’t overcome my thoughts in those moments. It’s because of this, and me constantly pushing people away, that I don’t have anyone in my life that I can talk to. I just feel lost and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been thinking about how suicide is my only escape and I hate that thought. I don’t want to die, but it’s also something I’ve never wanted more. I just wish that I had never existed in the first place. My 21st birthday is in less than 2 weeks and I’ve always imagined that I would have at least a small group of friends to go do something with but I’m going to have no one just like the last few years. It’s my fault so I can’t complain, but I wish I knew how to overcome this and how to get people to care about me and like me. This is the first time I’ve had persistent suicidal thoughts since right before high school and it’s just depressing. I know it’s not really me thinking this shit, but it also is.

"Sorry this is a mess, it’s getting bad again","There is so many things I wish I wasn’t. I know there is things about me that are not bad, but lately it’s been so hard for me to see any of them. I know I don’t want to die, but I think I’m too sensitive to even keep up with what the world wants from me. I just want everything and everyone to stop moving so I can catch my breath. So I can feel like myself again. But that’s never going to be possible. I feel so hopeless because I feel like I’m getting worse, the world is becoming worse, and the future of everything looks so bleak to me, but I still have to keep going to work like everything is cool. I’m exhausted. I just wish I could be held, and be told that I have been doing just fine, that I have been working hard and have come a long way and that there is nothing inherently wrong with me as a person. I have no one I could really tell about everything that’s been weighing on my chest lately. I have people who care about me but I still can’t find it in me to tell them these things anymore because I never feel completely understood. I just want to feel understood. Everyday I feel like it’s a wall growing between me and other people and it’s becoming so unbearable. I want to have friends, I want to have fun with others my age, I want to feel included and I want to know that people actually like me being around them and genuinely want to see me. If I died I know people would be sad but life goes on, right? They will get over it eventually? I have a lot of things that I have been wanting to do but lately I have been wondering will it even be worth it if there’s a chance that I’ll still be this lonely. It’s always been like this. How am I supposed to be responsible for my own well being when I get in my head this bad over stupid shit and lay in my bed for days straight desperately trying to ignore the outside world? I can’t even imagine myself living on my own at this point because I feel like I’m so emotionally fragile. I know it’s not always like this because I haven’t felt this suicidal since 2019/2020, but im scared that I might not shake this feeling off this time. I can’t believe I made it to 20 but I can’t believe that I still have so much life left. It’s scaring me and I’m so serious when I say I don’t think I can handle it.

I found peace,"Hi, i'm new here but i need to get it off my chest.

I dont want to live anymore, and have been feeling like this for a long time.

I have cptsd, because my father abused me in too many ways. I've been to every trauna therapy available, for over 10 years. My final inpatient trauma therapy, together with the right meds seemed to work.
I got into college, started living by myself and seemed to really be getting better. 

And just when everything became better, I was raped.
Again.

And everything I've worked through from my childhood came back with it.
The nightmares, the anxiety attacks, not being able to eat or shower.

My doctor can't do anything anymore, and my psychologist is on holiday for two months.

I'm 21 years old, and I have been living with the wish to just end it al since I was 7.
I know I have tried everything there is.
I don't want to go through all the therapy I had, again. I promised myself that if I tried everything and it didn't work, I could let go.

I know that I will miss the opportunity to try new things I might enjoy, beautiful moments with friends or family. I know what I will leave behind, but it isn't enough to stay anymore.

I don't think i have ever enjoyed life, sure there has been small moments but at the end of every single day for as long as i can remember, my only wish is tp die in my sleep. Peacefully.

I have never had an interest in life, ever since i was a little kid i didnt wanna pursue or do anything with my life. My only long lasting interest has been video games. Which is basically just an escape. I have always felt off. Every time someone brought or brings up the future i feel exhausted. 

A particular incident i remember from when i was a kid was that one of my friends asked all her friends including me if we wanted to die, i had never had a conversation about death before, we were about 7. I was shocked to hear that they all wanted to live. I thought it was relatively normal. I also vividly rememer her telling her mother that i wanted to die and i said it was all a joke. Bur even at such a young age i was determined and confident that i didnt like or enjoy life in the slightest. I dont wanna do anything. But im so bored. I always have been. I feel empty and i dont understand how people genuinely do this. But i also dont care what others do as long as it doesn't include me. I hate life and it had alwayd been that way.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for over 15 years. For a long time I tried to fix myself alone. When I started therapy almost 4 years ago, I was really determined and thought it would help me to finally change and improve my mental health. One of the six therapists who I have seen helped me a bit. I saw her almost every week for 2 years, but after my diagnoses changed she couldn't see me anymore. Our last appointment was three months ago. I regret telling her anything about myself and my life. She never really cared about me. I have a new therapist, who I see irregularly, but she can't help me and I'm not going to open up to her for her to just hurt me like everyone does.

I'm not going to live much longer. Why should I if medication and therapy won't help me? Why should I keep living if I'm just going to be lonely and useless like I have been my whole life, why should I live if I have nothing to offer to the world.

I really am not coping. I can’t see me getting better. It’s just like Effexor withdrawals are hell then if have to try something else and it may not work.

I'm sorry,"I've got no right for sympathy or space to be heard. I'm sorry for posting it. Could have written just for myself, but I feel that the symbolic value of telling about it to others can make me feel being heard. I'll soon delete it. 

It's all my fault. My loneliness, self-hstred, increasing anxiety and slow abandonment of any human lifestyle. I wasn't working or solving problems only in transport between jobs and now, when came home. I'm tired but I'm not. 

I envy people that were told they are loved. I envy kind and generous people. I envy confident ones. I envy people with strong resilience. I can envy people that don't try to run away from their families. I envy attention. 

The older I get the less I believe myself when I dream I can run away and pretend to be normal. That I can become better, that i can have moments of happiness.

I caught myself thinking that there's nothing left in my life that makes it worth it. Then I rembered how happy I feel when I put my alarm ten minutes later early cool morning and stay under warm blanket. That's the only thing that gives me strength.

I'll never make anyone happy. I can't afford to have kids. I don't love anything and anyone, including myself. I no longer believe that I can get love by  being polite, studying gard, doing my low-wage part-time jobs responsibly or making good films. 
You'll never make good films because you've started doing them to get love you want. That's why you had no progress throughout film school. You literally liked only one film of yours  because you liked the person you worked on it with. You're literally the worst. Asshole. 

I have a dream. I don't want to kill myself - just like so many people that fight these urges I just want it all to end. I want to lose my memory: my visual, muscle and reflex memory. It's ok, I don't have that many skills. I want to forget parents, him and her, I want to forget shame and a habit to beat myself up. It's all my fault. It's a very adult self-hatred, I'm proud of maturing.  

I was trying to control myself and not let bad thoughts out. I'm keeping silent about suicide thoughts, self-hstred and real unwillingness to shoot our next film. I improved, I'm trying to keep myself together. I have no energy to improved but I try really hard to keep yogether. And still whenever I slip I'm the biggest asshole in the world. ""How could you tell me you were fighting suicide thoughts. Like why would you put it on me? I'm not an audience for that."" Thanks. Now I feel even more guilty. 

I'm so tired. I want it all to end. I want to stop fighting desire to smash my head against the wall and punch myseld in the stomach with all my force. I want to stop fighting urge to scream to you how angry I am, how lonely it has been for me. 

I've cried so much tonight. But I'm doing a good thing, I'm trying to put it all out, I'm trying to understand what's going on. I haven't even reached out to anyone, that's veryvresponsible. There is a chance for me. If I have enough energy I can invest concentration and energy into thinking better, into making my thoughts go in a right direction. I will be able to overcome my ego and fear. I will be able to concentrate on perfecting my storytelling skills. I will not kill myself. I will not be a miserable lonely loser. It will take time, but I'll get there. I'll be calm, I'll be likeable, I'll have something to tell.sbout myself at the parties. 

I've got a suspicion what a trigger might have been. Fuck you, stupid man. You're the worst, you've got no taste, you handle bad moods even worse than I do and you're dumb as a newborn pigeon. Never want to hear about you again. There's a reason I cut people I loved from my life and convince myself they never really existed. 

I want a healthy clear brain. I want a strong ego that doesn't need anyone else. I want a stone heart. I want resilience of a grass lane. 

It got better now, which is good. I've stopped screaming and sobbing, I won't need to occupy suicide prevention line, I got it myself. I'm a writer. I should learn how to construct that lie of a healthy reality. I want to forget and stop aching. If I tell myself more often I might forget what the truth is.

He tells me to go to therapy, but every single fucking therapist I’ve been to seems to have a smug smile and doesn’t “get” my struggles. All they say is that I have to work on “CBT” and shit.

I’ve lost all self confidence I ever had. Over the past two months my life has drastically changed and I can’t accept the way things are. Im extremely depressed and nothing is keeping me going. I feel like a burden to take care of. Im at my wits end and don’t want to do this anymore. I’m trying to hang on but I don’t know how much longer I can.,Frozendough,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfntoj/one_week/
I have fucked up,"I know, Im a shit person, Im not a smart girl, Im just nothing. I almost threw up while went down the street just thinking how I hate myself at this moment. I know, I have betrayed in some way my mum, I just suck, and you deserve a better daughter, someone that will do everything you want, that will appreciate your advices, not like me. I just suck, I dont know why I still do it, I just fall again for addictions, and I just should kms. I dont want to give more problemas to her, and no, this problem can be fixed. I have fucked up so hard, my mam doesnt know nothing, but just betraying her in that way makes me feel like a shit and I dont like this feeling, I think kms would make me feel nothing and that would be better.

School’s Starting,"I am a straight A student, always have been, and I have only missed school for things that I had to attend (ex: driver’s test). This summer I realized that I hate school, something that I thought I enjoyed, and that I want to give up. I don’t want to work anymore or be stressed by this pointless work. I don’t look forward to my future because I miss being young. I can’t seem to grow up and I don’t want to. I want to die. My parents are distant and abusive and I had to grow up fast, so I never got a childhood. How is it fair that I have to grow up when I never got to be a kid? I don’t want to go to school, graduate, etc. I want someone to take care of me for once. I’m so sick of having to do everything by myself. I want to die, it would be so much easier. Every time I think about school, I just get more stressed because everything is moving really quickly and I’m not prepared and I hate it.",luciosew,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfgc1s/schools_starting/
I want this to end…,"I don’t know if i truly wanna kill my self or not but god im reaching my breaking point. Im tired of always being scared; I have OCD and constantly worry about sickness, or hurting other, etc etc. Just this week I was debating whether or not give up oil painting cause I had read about the toxicity of oil paints, i spiraled and threw out all my solvents, and paints that were not of natural oil. You would think that would calm me down but no, I’m still freaking out if smelling oil paint or any kind of paint will give me a chronic disease. I’m so tired of being afraid of everything, I’m tired of being depressed. Or not being able to do dumb shit without being afraid of fucking getting cancer. I can’t even enjoy something that’s suppose to be relaxing.

I went through a lot as a kid, my parents weren’t the best. At least I don’t think so I don’t know what I experienced was love, I was pampered, they bought me anything and everything. I was spoiled. But behind close doors I was yelled at, pinched, hit with belts, manipulated, threatened, the list goes on. I was mostly my mother while my father was absent due to work; he doesn’t even remember my birthday. I remember the moment where my mother truly hurt me; as Hispanics giving the “belt” was a typical punishment. Though when I was young I can’t remember what I did, I could’ve been in elementary. My mother had gotten her hands on a whip from my older sisters previous Halloween costume, she folded it and whipped me on my fore arm leaving a lash mark. I remember crying, apologizing to her. She cries as well but never apologized. I was a kid. 

I think most of my issues started from then, I developed OCD. Constantly worrying about anything and everything, I was was gonna grow up to be a murder, if I was gonna die tomorrow if I didn’t wash my hands, etc. My childhood instead of being filled with happiness and rainbows was filled with fear and loneliness. I would come home to a house filled with fighting, my father drank, cheated, my mother was always in the kitchen and my sister ,bless her, tried her best to be a mother figure. But despite that I grew up thinking that the yelling and the pain was love. That I should be grateful, when other kids had nothing. And I had a computer, iPad, etc. To this day I’m scared to admit that my parents hurt me.

Self harm, I didn’t know what that word meant till middle school. I use to wonder why anyone would ever mutilate themselves, but slowly I started to find out why. I started to use rubber bands to slap my wrists, punch walls to bruise my knuckles, I just wanted to find any way to feel something.  Not long after I found a razor and started; after spending hours in the bathroom, I came out happy. As if I let out all that tightness; so I kept doing it. It made me forget. My wrists, stomach, forearms ,thighs covered; most of the cuts were shallow and didn’t leave scaring.

It’s wasn’t long till my mother found out, she cried. Though I was given no comfort, on the country she just called my therapist to handle it. As my father was in the living room without a care in the world watching his soccer game, I was taken to the hospital, assisted, well I wasn’t my distressed mother was. The doctors never took my word, and it was clear from the moment I got there. So I started to lie, they had already deemed my cuts to be shallow and not enough to be hospitalized and since I basically told them I was fine they just referred me to a psychiatrist and sent me on my way. Did the psychiatrist help? No whatever I said in trust went through my mom, and she often twisted my words or just basically said things I did not say. Since I couldn’t escape the psychiatrist, therapy or medication I turned to cutting. I remember being so desperate to cut that I’d rip eyebrow cutters or shaving razors to just get my hands on one. And I did, this time what was shallow cuts became gashes and they scarred. Then I started to attempt my life, five separate times I attempted and no one knows. It was in middle school as well as my freshmen year of high school. I just remember crying and brushing my knuckles frustrated that I was such a pussy for not going through with it, I was in pain why couldn’t I just make it stop.

That leads to now I’m going to college in the fall, an art school, majoring in illustration. Stoped my medication, the pills never worked so why bother. I also didn’t stop cutting, no one knows but what I found I became more sensitive. Little things , little fears would be resolved in hurting myself. Like my intrusive fears of oil painting, I love oil painting I want to keep doing it but I’m afraid of cancer, and other chronic sickness so what do I do. I cut. God I’m pathetic why am I writing a Reddit post of my life, maybe because I just want someone to care to not look at me as if I’m crazy to not insult me or manipulate me like I was all my life. To not think my OCD/ intrusive fears are stupid, I want to be treated like a person I want to live a normal life but I can’t do that. I can’t even make decisions for myself without being scared, I’m a grown ass person and I’m crying about the smallest things. Sorry about this post being so long, I’m basically telling my whole story maybe if I really do kill myself maybe someone would read this and saw what happens behind my upbeat personality. That I was hiding deep scars, that I cried every night wishing someone would come and tell me I’m safe that I’ll be ok. I’m still scared of my parents, I feel like they build that in me already. I’m scared of myself I’m scared of art I’m scared of people I’m scared of the gashes on my skin that will never go away. I’m scared of living I’m scared of the future. I don’t wanna die but I don’t want to suffer. I can’t handle this I’m scared of everything I want it to stop I want to die I want it to end I wish I could say sorry to younger me. She didn’t deserve e to have scars, to live a life of fear. To want to die. I was just a kid .

backed myself into a corner,"You know how everytime you threaten suicide and dont follow through people take you less and less seriously? I feel like Ive been backed into a corner at this point. 
I haven't been unstable in a long while but lately Im acting stupid. Last night I sent out a major threat, wrote a note, texted my goodbyes/apologizies, I even walked myself to my cities popular yeet spot. 

I just wanted someone to care to be honest, but as I stood there, thinking about doing it, nobody replied. Admittedly I dont have many people in my life and it was 2am, they were both asleep and obviously wouldn't see it till they woke up. No one was there to talk me down or tell me I mattered.

I got so upset it probably should have pushed me over the edge, but I wussed out in the end and just took myself home and cried myself to sleep.
The good news is Im alive (I guess) but the bad news neither one of those people cared. One is even my roommate. He undoubtedly saw the text this morning, probably checked up on me and saw that I didnt do anything and went about his day. Neither one of them has texted me back any ounce of concern or even tried to call me. 

Im so embarrassed I feel like I have no other choice but to follow through now. Everybody thinks Im full of shit, no one even cares anymore because they assume I wont do it.

it's been almost a decade,"Over 9 years. I have wanted to end it all for almost a decade. I can't do this anymore. I've tried meds, I've done therapy, I've tried yoga, outdoors time, I even took a fucking six month hiatus off working(I was threatened with the psychward) and now all my fucking savings are gone. I tried to go back to work last month and almost got committed. 

It just never got better. Never not once. intrusive thoughts are always there. Awful horrible thoughts about hurting others. Incest, murder, violence. They won't leave. I want to hurt myself every fucking day. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Then there's they physical pain. Chronic aches and headaches and hives. The fact that I just got diagnosed with a mental disability, but I'm not ""disabled enough"" for help.

I acknowledge I'm blessed enough to have a roof over my head. I'm blessed enough to have food and clean water. But man. If I die I'd save my folks so much money. My family wouldnt have to live with their knives  and meds (even just ibuprofen) locked up at all times. They wouldn't have to monitor the bathroom after I eat to see if I purged. They wouldn't have to check if  I swallowed my pills. They would have to keep an eye on the gun safe to make sure i didnt try and break in.they don't have to do full body checks to make sure I didn't hurt myself. No more threatening to shove me in the hospital. More hospital bills. They wouldn't have to worry about me ever again. They have other kids to worry about. I shouldn't be doing this to them.

 Idk what to do. I want to end it but because of my break down I don't have access to anything. My folks even check to make sure i swallowed the damn pills so i cant save them up.  Idk if this makes sense. I just want peace. I want it all to end. I came so close and blew it. I got caught. And now I'm trapped in this eternal hell.

Both on Reddit or otherwise, when I talk about my issues it seems like most people don't get it at all. The thing that made me really realize this was when someone asked about my long term goals. I was so stunned I didn't even know how to respond. The only relatable thing I've seen is the book Shoot the Damn Dog by Sally Brampton, which ironically I haven't been able to finish because depression makes it hard to do. Although she eventually died of suicide, so maybe the reason I can't find anyone who relates is because they've already died.

Advice for taking care of someone who attempted suicide,"Hello. Never really asked for advice on here but hoping to get some pointers. 

I recently picked up my gf from a state ordered psychiatric ward after a failed suicide attempt and I was hoping someone that has gone through a similar experience can shed any light on how to deal day to day. I know she is obviously depressed and embarrassed and I am trying everything to make her feel comfortable, but it feels as though I am making it worst. Almost as though she resents me for finding her and getting her to ER in time to save her life. 

Idk what to do I’m sitting bedside after she took all of her “prescriptions.”  This is the only country (USA) where they would treat a pill inducing suicide attempt with MORE PILLS.

No amount of medication or therapy makes me “want” to stay,"I’ll admit I’m more mentally stabilized than I ever have been, but I still yearn to just pass on. My soul is so exhausted of hurting, heartbreak, and loneliness. I’ve tried to find my place in this world but the more I try, the more alienated I feel.

I very depressed mom,"This weekend I tried to commit suicide twice, through the process I assaulted my husband (punched his chest while sleeping for him to talk with me during the second incident.) I was arrested, and ended up going to the hospital twice. I lost control infront of my daughter and involved both husband and daughter very briefly, but did none the less. My husband and I are forced to stay apart the next 17 days, I don't have alot of family and don't want to tell many people. I've been very sick mentally the pass 6 months, and alot has changed for us financially and for my health. My husband has been taking care of our two cats and dog myself and daughter and working fulltime. My husband wants a break from both my daughter and I, I'm not sure how to deal with this. The situation all began when I woke up from throwing up for 3 days, and my husband said he reached a breaking point said nothing else and walked away. I was abused by my parents as a child, and he contacted them to watch her for a few weeks so he could ketch up. Unfortunately because of throwing up, a late doctor's app/prescription I was off meds for 3 weeks and was super sick with migraines. I was just diagnosed with adhd, bpd, and ptsd and getting diagnosed possibly with more mental health stuff. With me being off meds and not eating I went crazy, I screamed and yelled and honestly have been arctic since. I'm curious if anyone else has delt with something similar? All I want is my husband back, and for things to go smoothly when we get to see each other (I'm working on making the court date sooner hopefully.) I'm curious if anyone else has delt with this before and if anyone has advise to help calm my anxiety and can help with my situation. I'm a very kind, sweet person, but my husband does deal with my uncontrollable abuse at times when I'm not on meds and or stressed. My two year old is with my parents for the few weeks due to just how everything played out and my anxiety is also overwhelming. Please someone have something to compare to.

I'm planning to kms on my birthday,"It's August 3rd while I'm writing this and my birthday is in 12 days. I'm very young, but none of my birthdays have really meant anything since I was like 12. I know no one's going to remember or even care, like usual. But that's the least of my worries. I should be grateful for all I have. I live in an apartment that was given to me by my grandma since my step dad died and my mom got strung out. She sells drugs now and is even less of a mother than she already was. I guess I can say I've been through a lot. Neglect, abuse, sexual assault..but honestly none of that really matters. It's the aftermath of everything that fucks me up. I have horrible mood swings. Every single day, I go through periods of extreme anger and sadness. When I'm angry, I like to ruin things for myself. When I'm sad, all I can think about is killing myself and how unlovable I am. That gut wrenching feeling occurs every single day, but even when I'm okay. I feel so empty, nothing and no one can fill the void. I've made so many people hate me. I don't have anyone close in my family. My grandma pushed me into an eating disorder, and my brother sexually assaulted me. I have a best friend that I constantly ruin things with, even though they are my everything. No one can fill the void. No amount of pills, or alcohol, or weed, or whatever substance I choose to abuse this week will ever change the fact that I am so empty and alone. My thoughts won't stop and I don't know how to be okay no matter how hard I try. I don't know how to stop ruining things for myself. I don't know how to love people like normal. I don't even think I'm capable of being love or loving someone. And the people that tell me that the small things matter. Getting out of bed, taking a shower, cleaning, amd taking care of myself in any way. That shit never works for me, and I don't understand why. I can do it, but it doesn't stop the consistent empty void I feel every single day. It doesn't stop the intense mood swing. I don't want to feel this anymore and I can only think of one escape.

I attempted suicide in May. I survived, but everyone made it pretty clear how much they didn't care. I was put on Lexapro, and I guess it kind of stabilized my mood. But I still felt so empty, so I stopped taking them. I went through the withdrawal and nearly lost my mind, but I'm still here. I haven't had therapy or anything since, and my first therapy appointment is on the 11th. But I can't tell anyone anything about the stuff that has happened to me without bringing some serious legal trouble onto my parents. And the things I can talk about seem so miniscule. I just don't know what to do anymore. I figured it would be best to do it on my birthday, so I can realize how unloved I am.

Does it really get better?,"I struggle with life, the concept of living, just the idea of waking up another day when almost every moment of joy is just demolished by weeks of sadness.

**I have always been like this.** I don't get this world , I just don't get the humans I interact with. **Why do I feel this immense sense of alienation like I am from another planet?**

I no longer even have emotions apparently, I can only feel the worry inside my guts, or my heart beating so fast as if it were about to explode. I can't even cry when I am extremely sad or miserable, I can't force myself to let my emotions out, not even by screaming out loud.

**Can you really regain control over your own body after you've been abused?** It really sucks how trauma works, especially when it's recent. You can't just think about something else after the incident. It really sucks when you put a lot of value in your studies and one week before an exam you just get the shit beaten out of you. You try to save the day by burying yourself under your studies, but that's not how trauma works, so instead you just show up to an exam completely absent-minded. You feel like there's some sorta disconnect between your body and consciousness, like ""My legs are moving towards my seat, but my brain is somewhere else.""  type of shit. Your brain wants to confront the incident despite knowing goddamn well that it's not the time for such matters. Now, even your most valuable activity has destroyed your self-esteem, brought to you an immense amount of insecurities, you start to wonder whether you belong in this lecture hall or not.

**No matter how many people tell you how good you are at something you will never believe it when your self-image is just distorted.** Yes, you remember your past, the good, the bad, and the ugly. You remember your achievements, you know some good things you have done, your self-image is not some piece of shit human being, it's just a distorted image, you don't know who you are outside of your studies because you don't belong somewhere. You start to question your own choices, decisions, and preferences. You feel like a phony, not because you suck up to people, because you are probably lying to yourself, ""but how would I know since the only voice I listen to is mine?""

Now, you are sane enough to understand that just taking the easy way out isn't a solution to your problems, you don't wanna quit, you wanna solve the shit you been dealing with.

I attempted suicide months ago. The pills I swallowed might have injured my liver and I'm scared,"I changed. I was not myself during that period of time and I am slowly gaining trust in life again. But I'm scared for my health.

I'm 18, tried killing myself in January which is 7 months ago by swallowing about 30 paracetamol pills. I ended up vomitting the whole night followed by a week of sickness where all I did was throw up. I didn't tell anyone. Please tell me what to do I'm scared.

Months ago I had liver pain that was pretty extreme and went to the hospital with my dad pretending I didn't know what was going on. They basically sent me back home after telling me the pee test result was fine (as if that had anything to do with my liver) 

According to them I should do a radiography but my doctor prescribed me medicine for stomach aches, saying we'll do a radiography if the pain persists. My plan is to take the medication for the upcoming weeks but I know damn well it won't do shit. I just wanna go do the radiography thing.

I have weird feelings at my liver and chest. It's been like this since months and jogging helps but I read things online saying my situation can lead to cancer and it's driving me nuts.

I can't tell anyone I attempted suicide. I am not in a sane household, this would only put more pressure on my parents. I haven't done anything dangerous to myself ever since and I promise I won't attempt again. 

I don't want my life to be ruined. I don't want to be put in an asylum.

I just want to know if I am seriously in danger. I can practice pretty much any daily life exercise physical or mental and the pain never bothers me too much.

It feels like I'm born to kill myself,"I hate myself, my surroundings, my feelings and personality. My life feels like i have been born to just kill myself, like someone is laying down huge ass stones in my way just to see me killing myself. My dad died when i was 10 because of cancer. I didnt really care at that age, because i didnt understood it. In 2019 my grandma died a naturel death but she was one of my favorite persons. Then in 2020 my mother found a mew boyfriend with had 2 sons. In 2021 One of them killed himself, he was in the army and took a wepon ran away and shoot him, and till this day nobody knows why. He was like a brother for me that i nerver had. Around half a Year later I started to think about killing myself. I feel emty, drank in my head, im just decent in literally every part in life that exists, there is nothing that im good at. There ist nothing to look forward to. There is nobdy that understand me, everbody is like ""it will be fine"" etc. I just wanna be free from this pain. My surroundings are just toxic and really really dumb. There are just these little happy moments when im around my family but i would prefer to be alone. My mom took away everything that I loved like video Game, which were a one of the small things in my life to make me happy. She wants we to have fun, wich ich understandable, and that life existes outside of my room. I kept explaining to her that I don't want to do stuff like go outside and just have fun with friends or drinking. 
Now during summer I like staying inside because I don't like summer and this hot temperatures. Every time she walks by and asks me if I don't want to hang out with my friends or go to the beach with them I say no, because I just don't want to. But now she gives me the feeling that in an disappointed and just a lazy basdart (Which I'm not, I go to the gym 5x a week.) Compared to my older sister which has a job, an apartment etc etc. She hates me and thinks I waste my life. She prefers her by far.
Her new boyfriend, which son killed himself thinks that im a boring and lazy person, because his son was a very very active person and I'm not. So he keeps telling me to be better at life and have fun. But I don't want to, I don't have such a huge social battery to do stuff with Freund more than once a month or every two months.

And you know what I'm doing?

Well since my amazing parents do not let me leave my fucking house and have any sort of life (parents that also hate me and insult me and abuse me 24/7, I literally hear words like ""idiot, retard, go fuck yourself"" like idk, 10 times more often than I hear my own name), what I am doing is rotting at home, attempting suicide, crying, sometimes gaming and masturbating because that's the nicest thing I can do but even this is already boring and tiring, oh and also, I can't even express myself! I cannot dress how I want, I cannot look how I want, I cannot be myself like I want, why? Well you fucking guess why, I hate """"""life"""""""", I can't even call it life because what I'm ""living"" is not life, it's vegetation, I'm literally not fucking better than a plant, I do nothing more than a plant does, I mean I can walk and talk but other than that I'm a fucking plant and I get treated like a fucking plant too, like a disgusting plant made from pure dog shit at that.

You cannot call it a life when you have no social life or romantic life or fucking any adjective you put before life, I do not have it

Other people are enjoying life, having fun, doing all these fun stuff, and I am rotting, and hurting when I see them doing all the things I wish I could do

Someone is dying, I either can't take it anymore and kill myself, or I snap and commit an unspeakable crime, either way its not gonna be my fault if this is what I'm dealing with

i feel like my life's over,"honestly at this point i feel like nothing good will ever happen to me and i've ruined everything i had. i lost my dad to suicide almost exact 2 years ago and honestly, i'm jealous he had the courage to do it, because i'm pretty sure i never will. i keep imagining and telling myself ""this time next year life will be completely different and you'll be healthy again"", and it's just never. true. i've been going on like this for 4 years already and i've lost all my hope at this point. i go to therapy, i take meds. none of those things are helping. 
the worst thing is those few years ago i'd never suspect my life's gonna turn into this. it's just a constant cycle of me entering old destructive cycles again, such as self harm, binge eating, dieting, drinking or sleeping around with bunch of strangers i met off internet. and at this point i'm not even sure why i do this, is it to feel something or in order to make myself feel worse. i feel so worthless and ugly and i really don't want to live anymore. the only thing keeping me from doing it is i honestly don't know how i'd do that, but i'm doing my research already. i'm sad that it's come to this because i'll never marry, never see my friends live their lives fully, never experience happiness again. but hey, at the same time my pain will end. i'm also not sure how my mum's gonna handle this and it scares me. i don't want her blaming herself, although i'm extremely mad at my parents. that they didn't believe me when it all started. they just brushed it off and i was alone. i still am

"found a full box of meds, want to OD","So I have a nurse that comes weekly to fill my med case. She has all my meds so that I can't OD when I get triggered or feel suicidal like I have been for the past week or so.
Now I found a full box of meds that I either forgot to give her or kept here on purpose, I honestly don't remember. 
Anyways, I've been really suicidal the past week, especially the past 2 days. It's all I can think about.
The problem is I'm too anxious to tell anyone except for my online friend who lives across the planet.
I can't go to a psych ward or hospital again cause those places have given me more trauma than anything. I've a whole plan in place in case I ever get admitted against my will to succesfully off myself.

I'm scared. I don't care about my own life, but I do care about my friends and family and how it would affect them. It's a constant battle in my head and I'm afraid the suicidal thoughts are starting to win.

I have been constantly getting suicidal thoughts due to my failure in social life,"I am 23. I have a good successful career going and also have been mostly successful in academic side. But I am a complete failure in social life. I have no practical social life outside of work. Not a single friend as such whom I hangout with. Not able to had a single romantic relation ever. I also have lots of social anxiety and likely depression. I did try to work on my anxiety but not much success.

No body wants me with them. I am the most boring person with no personality. I am a liability than anything. And being ugly with non existing personality is the best recipe of social life.

 Even tried to pursue a person I had a huge crush on, but my lack of social skills and anxiety made me come off as a creep and failed there as well, making things even worse.  
Cannot seek professional help as not easily available where I live and my low self esteem makes me think I am wasting time instead of working or studying for exams I am planning to give.

Lots of days recently suicide is the only way I can see ahead. Even almost tried killing myself by hanging and once by suffocating. I cannot take this loneliness and anxiety anymore. It is especially worse on weekends, when most the people I know and are in similar position as me are out there having time of their lives. While my lonely ass is at home all alone. 

I am trying to keep positive, trying to delete negative thoughts. But is difficult. One day I am filled with positivity, the next complete opposite.

How do I support her through this?,"Hi Reddit,

I have a family member I’m sorta close with, she has been drifting away and spiraling I’ve been watching it and I don’t know how to help.

I’ve been there.. I know that low..

I want to be there for her without her feeling like I’ve invaded her privacy OR without her feeling like her husband betrayed her trust.. she needs all the people she can get in her corner right now.. so..

How do I be there for her? How can I reach out? What would be the right thing to say?

My parents stole 10 years of my life and yet I'm the problem.,"Everything started going down hill after I moved back in with my parents about 10 years ago.  Why I moved back home was because I hurt my wrist and couldn't get time off from work, because I had already used my time the first time I was hurt within the same year. My room mate was over charging me on the rent, and I was going broke fast, then our home got robbed, twice. Room mate blames me. I go back home.

Fast forward a year and I get a new job that I like, but then my mom gets cancer. I felt like it was my ""duty"" to take care of her since I am living here, but I couldn't balance my job and going to the doctor 5 days a week. So I quit. I spend 3 years taking care of her and she dies anyway, in my arms even. For some reason, my older sister gets 50% of the inheritance, even though it was me who sacrificed my life to take care of mom. My dad gets 40%, and me and my younger sister get 10%.  Now my dad is left alone, so I stay to take care of him. He also doesn't have his drivers license. Sister buys a boat, dad pays off the house. I pay for an equal share of a giant tombstone, which cost about 50% of what I was given.

I finally get back into work, have to explain to employers why I was unemployed for so long in my 20s. The new job I work at is terribly filthy, like dust that smells of gunpowder and sulfur and it doesn't wash out. It's a night shift job. My dad doesn't let me sleep in the morning. I'm extremely unhappy, but I'm making enough to support myself, but Idk how much I can keep this up. The smell, the itching, the lack of sleep. Not worth $1000 a week. Then I have a hernia, my insurance doesn't cover me. I get put on light duty for 1 week. I have a panic attack at work during over time and leave. Get fired. Can't get unemployment. I coast on whatever I had saved up.

I get another job that I really like with people who are cool. But I don't make enough to even cover rent if I were to move out. Covid happens. My dad makes me quit my job, but says he'll support me, because he's afraid I'll catch covid being around people and bring it home with me. He's old and talks about dying all the time. It's not a good time. Then my car breaks in half from rust. So now I only drive the family car, which belongs to my dad who can't even legally drive it.

I ask for nothing, I drive him everywhere, I help with yardwork, I take care of the dog. I also still pay my phone bill, while unemployed, getting no income at all. Draining my savings. But he'll support me, right? Two years into this stupid pandemic. I'm out of money. He starts paying my phone bill but acts like it's such a massive burden and talks to me like I'm a gigantic failure. He says he doesn't need my help. He does. He still doesn't have his license to drive. He now has heart problems, isn't eating, won't listen to me trying to help. He complains about money, makes $3000 a month retired, has my moms inheritance, $25000 in the bank ""for funeral expenses"".. again with the dying talk. 

What am I doing here? what was all that for? I'm wasting my life for people who hate me. I'm a burden, a failure. How am I supposed to be independent ever? Do I wait for dad to die? will he leave me anything? Will I be homeless? Can I find work ever again, at my age with my lack of experience and history of quitting? Man... It feels like the best thing is for me to just not exist anymore. I haven't been suicidal in years, but this is really destroying me. If I cost so much to keep alive maybe I'll just stop eating. I'm not even allowed to have a fan in my room and it's 100 degrees. He blames me for heating up the house and making the AC run all the time. I'm sick of this.",Demiyqxzurge,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfd35n/my_parents_stole_10_years_of_my_life_and_yet_im/

I don't have friends, lover, job, hobbies (most of the stuff I do is just out of routine I built as my life started to get shitty) or goals and I still hate myself for this and more but I don't have the strength or the willpower to change and never will because deep down I don't want to, this mental illness is my thorny friend, it hugs me as it digs it's thorns into me just to remind me that this is the best I'm gonna get.

I did counselling. I grew up with not the best family situation and have worked to overcome that. To let go and move on and to rebuild my self esteem - I feel like I acheived both. I also take antidepressants - this has helped massively with my anxiety.

However, despite all this I feel numb. My anxiety and sadness has been replaced with emptyness. Everything feels trivial, almost pointless. 

It’s been niggling at me for a while but it really hit me last week when our long time family dog of 14 years passed away - a dog that at one point I would have died for. I didn’t feel anything, no sadness, not a single tear.

Not doing so well, hence why I am on this sub. Anyway, lets get into it, shall we?

**TL;DR: I'm so irrevocably BORED of all this. Can I please have a different challenge at this point?**

Lately, I haven't been feeling the best, dealing with these niggling little fantasies about turning myself into something akin to roadkill lately. A part of the first-degree murder I'd like to commit upon myself is to find a way to make my body disappear. Or at least be hard enough to find so as to allow anyone who will miss me to find closure and/or headcanon that I *didn't* gank myself. But that's neither here nor there...

The reason for this post is that I've come to terms with the fact that I'll be making my exit soon. I was hoping to wait until 40 (I'm 33 now), but now I don't know... I've stopped taking my meds, I probably going to stop going to my therapy appointments--I just don't really see the point or importance anymore. Been struggling with my mental health problems for over twenty years--two thirds of my life--and I feel like I haven't moved anywhere.

I think about this the same way I think of my mother and her siblings. They are all in their 40s/50s, they all had trash childhoods and whatnot, but my mother was the only one able to pull herself up by her bootstraps, raise four children (the fifth one died of crib death), spend much of her 20s and 30s being sucked dry by her parasitic siblings, and make *something* out of herself, and I'm really proud of her. But I also think about her brothers/my uncles stuck in the same vicious cycles they've been stuck in for literally as long as I've been a part of this world. And I see this whole mental health struggle of mine turning into one of those vicious cycles.

So... Like I said, I've been dealing with this for twenty years at least. And it's not so much that I'm ""sad"" (because I've grown bored of being ""sad""), it's not so much that I'm angry (because I'm bored of that too), nor am I particularly confused (as that has also lost it's novelty too). I feel as though I've taken a step back and looked at all of this for what it really is, as far as what this particular individual is concerned. There really is no point to any of this.

There really is no point. I've spent twenty years going back and forth with medications with all these side effects, and then I have to take two and three more medications to deal with the side effects of the first pill, and MORE pills to deal with the side effects of the pills that are supposed to STOP the sided effects that started this whole geschichte to begin with. I've been back and forth with therapist after therapist who don't really have anything unique or interesting to say from one another. Been back and forth with psych ward stays who pump me full of meds to ""stabilize"" me and send me on my way. Been back and forth with myself, turning over a new leaf and finding a new outlook on life, only for that disingenuous outlook and view to drain me emotionally as I try to keep it up, and back and forth with the emotions themselves because that's literally what schizo-affective bipolar is. Been back and forth with friends and family, but same with the doctors: these Hallmark greeting card platitudes, as well as all of these multi-paragraph and multi-faceted contradictions about why I'm supposed to stay here as everyone else's source of supply and validation, when I can't even supply to and validate myself.

Basically, I've reached a point in my life where I'm just completely bored with this whole struggle, I'm no longer fascinated with (my) mental health, and I'm tired of fighting the same challenger for a reward that doesn't even seem like its worth it anymore.

Don't know how long I have at this point. I was hoping for to wait for another seven years (hell, I should at least allow myself that, right?), but last time I stopped my mental health treatment, I crumbled to dust in about three months.

no time to call down,"So lately life has been a bit shitty, with which I mean the last 2 months or so. I can't really call down to think about everything in detail, plus I feel pretty alone thanks to almost everyone I know not being available atm. I really need some physical attention, like hugging for a few hours. Or atleast someone I can talk to.
As to what has happened over the last 2 months. I had a cough for about a month, which now gave me some problems with my lungs. As far as I can tell it doesn't get worse through sports so I still go to my local gym, doesn't mean that I'm not worried, but if I don't go to the gym I'll feel worse mentally and same goes the other way around.

You know what scratch that bs. I'm scared, scared of myself, scared of the future and scared of whatever this universe throws at me next. I just want to live a life after my own wishes, sure it might not be possible but it feels like I'll never make progress as long as I won't harm myself and I'm scared that that might in fact be how this world works. Constantly something throws itself in my way. Before these 2 months started there was constantly something new that hindered me from going to the gym, I was not able to go to Uni almost half of the time this Semester. And while all that is happening I can't stop pursuing my own goals, even though I might end up fucking everything up myself. And it's exhausting hearing everyone tell me that I am a good person, because I know that I am self destructive, I would rather die than give up my goals. And even though I know that, it still keeps going on.

Just want to offer others some hope.,"First off, if you're reading this , I'm going to assume that you're feeling really down , maybe even suicidal. I want to say that I'm sorry for your pain and suffering. 

I suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts up until about 5 months ago. There is hope. As long as you tough it out , you're allowing for the opportunity to come for things in your life to get better. If you take your own life, that chance of your life ever getting better goes away. 

Here's what's helped me get better. 

1. Medication- this was probably the biggest game changer for me. I had severe depression for so long that my brain needed help to get back to being happy again. 

2. Try to change your perspective- instead of being sad , try appreciating every little and big good thing in your life. Write down all of the positive things that you can think of in your life , read it everyday as a reminder of you have to. 

3. Spend time in nature and in the sun- Both nature and the sun can improve your mood. Fresh air is great. Watching animals is a fun way to pass time. Even going out at night to look at the stars is a good way to pass time.

4. Journal- when you're feeling down or even happy .. take time out of your day or week to Journal and get your thoughts out on paper. Keep it to reflect on , or burn it if you choose to. 

5. Cut toxic people out of your life - this can help you feel a lot better. People that are toxic to you can potentially bring you down!

6. Take a break from social media and unfollow , unfriend , or even block people that you don't like - seeing people on your friend's list that you are no longer close with or had a falling out with can really bring you down. It can also bring you down when you compare your life to their lives. Remember, people only show you what they want you to see on their social media. 

7. Get enough sleep- for me personally if I don't get enough sleep.. my depression can come back in full swing. I become irritated and sad. 

8. Hygiene- keeping up with your personal hygienic needs.. like taking a shower and brushing your teeth before bed can really make you feel a lot better. 

9. Set goals - either small or big or both!

10. Time- give yourself time. Don't cut your life short over feelings that are temporary. 

I am not knocking your feelings , I am just stating what worked for me , in hopes that if you try these things , that they will work for you as well!",kactbd2020,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wff3hq/just_want_to_offer_others_some_hope/

I do not want to tell my friends, family or even suicidal warmlines that I want to do it because I will be sent to a 72 hour watch. I just want to just do it and forget about it but I know I will hurt others. Can I really take that chance?

I feel stuck, hopeless, despair, confused - when the music is off, the TV is off, the loved ones are gone, whenever I am alone I feel completely empty. I have made 300 phone calls in one month. I feel empty inside. 

I think the Lord wants me to embrace the silence instead of masking it with distractions. Can I handle it?

What's stopping you from doing it?,"For me it's my brother. Poor guy shouldn't have to lose his brother at age 23. Part of me also doesn't really want to die if I'm being honest. It's just that I've done so many mistakes so far in my life of 20 years along with having a pretty odd family that I can never really talk due to their backwards upbringing. I remember telling my father recently about a kid who commited suicide at college and he was like ""man what's wrong with kids nowadays, God gives you a life just for you to waste it like that smh"" etc. 

But I've been keeping a secret from them for months now that I'm too afraid to tell. If it gets out, I'll be sleeping on the streets and perhaps even disowned. All because they didn't let me do what I wanted with my life and never considered how important mental health is. Depression is like a daily running joke at our house when even the slightest thing doesn't go right. ""They had no red onions left at the supermarket, it's giving me depression"". ""Why couldn't you be a member of the supreme court like my friend's kid, it's giving me depression"" etc. ""Why aren't you exactly like the 10+ other cousins who got engineering degrees and all that"" and so on. 

I feel like my life could have taken a considerably better direction, not necessarily a much better one considering my family will remain the same but yeah. And it crushes me every single day for the past 10 years that it is how it is as pathetic as it is now.",PlatinumPhoenix123,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfdgr0/whats_stopping_you_from_doing_it/

When may came i thought i was going to fail my classes and ended up being suicidal. I opened up it to my parent’s but i don’t think they understand how hard it is to have motivation to live. My friends and every relationship i have is very important to me and i never had any falling out with my past friendships or relationships with a significant other so this event hit me hard. I received numerous mockery and hateful speech because of what happened that one night when i broke down. I was ridiculed online and treated as shit. All i could do was say sorry and i really was and i already accepted if they cant forgive me and i cut off any communications we all have but i got news from other friends what they were saying about me. When june and july came i met a new girl who helped me through all of it but lately i don’t want her to feel like im a burden. And eventually i failed my classes and got delayed a year from graduating because of my lack of motivation and lost of interest in studying. I felt i wasn’t ready to become a medical professional at that point and my family lashed out on me to the point threatened to beat me up and disown me. Note that i am a student that gets high grades and always on top of my class but this one event where i failed resulted in my family treating me differently. Lately im so lost and i want to end it and the only thing thats keeping me from killing myself is the girl that helped me through this. I don’t think she can handle me dying of suicide.",Sifusora,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfbj5v/not_feeling_my_best_rn/

Every day more suicidal,"So, it's been a while since my depressed state has been growing but these days is turning hell. 

Due to summer, I am in home until september I begin again college so I spend most of the day alone only with my thoughts, so  memories came into my mind and make me feel sick, angry and extremely sad and depressed. 

The main reasons for my depressed state is that some months ago I lost the only girl I truly loved and can't forget. Also I am trying to build income or pass the college career but I failed in some areas and my parents are not very happy with this. 

My only hobby is go to gym and lifting some weights and maybe meet sometimes with a couple friends and playing some pool at afternoons or party at night. Drinking a lot of alcohol too, only thing that make me happy for a moment. 

What I am feeling is that every day I feel more sorrow and more depressed, I feel sick of the head and suicidal thoughts appear more frequently, I feel that I am a failure and living like this doesnt make sense.",Nov927,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wfaw2w/every_day_more_suicidal/
Need serious help . I need to cure pedophilia or I can’t live any longer.,"Hey, I’m looking for some real advice. I can’t live like this anymore. I need to be cured. A little about me. I was sexually abused for 5 years as a little boy. At 13 I got a crush on this little girl( first sign). I’m 22 now. I just need help and I’m already in therapy for my pedophilia but it doesn’t help. I can’t accept this part of myself. I’ve tried. I can’t. I just can’t. I can’t live like this. Where can I get pedophile conversion therapy or cure myself somehow. I wanna kill myself. I could go on and on about how much it sucks to have this, how depressed it makes me, and how much self hatred I have. But lets keep this short. You get the point. Someone please help me and tell me where to get conversion therapy . I literally can’t live my whole life like this. What’s the point of living when people want you dead?

Becoming suicidal again,The other morning I woke up and the first thought to enter my conscious mind was ‘I should hang myself’. I’ve been having this thought on and off now for the last few days.

Car accident didn’t die,"So, yesterday was a bad mental health day I drove to work and the entire time I was trying to ignore the thoughts I was having. Then, the thoughts overpowered me and I called out and drove all the way home just crying from depression and the feeling of wanting to just completely die and give up. I have a decent life, nothing to really be depressed about in my opinion but for some reason I feel so much pain and my mind won’t just shut up. I have had 2 suicidal attempts in the past but this time I just had suicidal ideation I didn’t plan on doing anything to hurt my self because I have tried before twice and it was clearly unsuccessful and you just feel worse after. 

Anyways, some friends invited me out for taco Tuesday. I told them I was feeling down and I did not want to go but they talked me into it. As I was getting ready I texted another friend that I was feeling suicidal and I just needed to vent. They responded and said that they are busy, so I should reach out to someone else. I just sucked it up and proceeded to head out to meet my other friends. On the way there I was going through the green light and this car t-boned me at the intersection and when I woke up I was in a ditch and all my airbags on the driver’s side had deployed. I started to panic because I couldn’t get out my car I was trapped in and the eventually I was able to crawl out through the passenger side. The car was absolutely totaled and I left the scene untouched just severely pained up and bruised. Everyone is happy I’m alive and safe but my feelings are still the same and if anything I feel worse, and I feel ungrateful.

One step forward eight steps back,"Consciousness is just self flagellation at this point. There's no way out and the ROI on existence gets deeper in the red every hour.

Every day I seem to have a less 'get up and go' than the prior one. Everything I try, or do, seems to fail miserably. I get walloped with unexpected bad news on a regular basis, and I feel constantly as though the next big thing will be the one that finally pushes me over the edge, exhausts any last bit of hope. I'll never get out of debt, my parents are only getting older and poorer and sicker, and I feel like every day has a moment when I can see some light from outside this deep well in which I live but then, later, realize it's just an illusion. 

I get up the energy once or twice a week to apply for another job, something not soul-crushing, and yet despite dozens of applications I haven't so much as heard back. I try to find joy in things but it's just not there. The pain in the back of my throat of hopelessness, of knowing how much pain lies ahead, is present more and more hours each day. I never used to cry, but now I just break down for no particular reason every few hours.

"I don't know if this post is gonna be long or not, I'm just gonna write whatever comes to my mind. So here it goes.","I've been depressed for about 5 years now. My life is in grey and black. I've lost interest in everything I once desired. Everything seems pointless and meaningless. I wake up and my day is ruined, reminded  by the fact that I have to bear the sadness and nothingness until I finally do it. 

You know that feeling when you are just sitting there and waiting for the bus to arrive? Or you're standing in a line with a bunch of people, or you're broke and you're waiting for your salary. That's how I feel nowadays. I'm just waiting to die. Sitting idly. Waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting...

I can't defeat my body. I've tried to kill myself 3 times in the past. Every time, there is this force that keeps me from doing it. I just freeze at the moment. Yet, I regret failing to do it every single day. I wish I had killed myself at the first opportunity.

I am a living contradiction. I'm an enigma, a paradox. Nothing makes sense inside of me. I yearn for interaction, connection to feel related to others, but I am inherently unable to relate with anyone. Because of my personality deep down, I strive to be different than anyone else. And I hate the fact that I try to be different than anyone else. I'm alone on this whole earth, and the loneliness is killing me. I care for others, yet I don't really care about anything at all. I search for something that doesn't exist. I do things that I don't want to do. Knowing that this world is just suffering, I am unable to relieve my self from it.

I know that everyone has problems and I acknowledge that people have problems. But the thing is, I wish I had problems, I wish my life was dramatic, and I had ups and downs. I wish I felt fear, I wish I felt anxious. I wish I felt excitement. But I feel nothing, my constant state of mind is below a regular person's saddest day. My happiest day is below a regular person's normal day.

Whether or not I even want to be happy is an another story. Deep down I feel like I want to be happy. But how can you yearn for something that'll never happen. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing makes me excited. I tried to get help, see therapists, and it didn't work. Maybe the problem is just inherently in my mindset.

I do not fear death. And I hope no one fears my death. Because it's a good thing. I will finally do the only thing that I've wanted my entire life. I'll be nothing.",Maylul,21,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wecxdk/i_dont_know_if_this_post_is_gonna_be_long_or_not/

I have nothing, I have no one, I am losing everything, getting no value for anything I own because I don't have enough money to do things like sell my car through private sale properly.

Needed a surgery to save my life. It was botched.,"I’m not really looking for advice, just need to get this off my chest. I have suffered enough abuse at the hands of psychiatry and medicine in general.

Last minute my surgeon fell ill and I was transferred to another one who was less experienced. Word of advice: *don’t ever let this happen to you*. I got mutilated. Horrifically.

It’s been a few months. I shower once a week, sleep all day and forget to eat. I am weak and sickly, often too lethargic to leave my bed. I did not heal. My scars keep reopening. My body is irrecoverably damaged. There is absolutely nothing I can do about it. Not a single day goes by without me wanting to kill myself. I gave up. I had plans for the future but I know I will not survive.

I wish I let it kill me instead of getting that surgery. It was supposed to save me. I lost sensation in half of my body while some areas can only feel pain. I find it hard to so much as get up, let alone shower or change my clothes. I don’t leave my house. I don’t have an appetite anymore. I look in the mirror and I cry. Every time. I am merely a shell of a human being. There is nothing behind my eyes anymore.

I love my partner, but I lied. We can’t be together forever. I am slowly dying and I will be gone soon. He has shown me nothing but love. I was his only hope. He was my only hope. He says when I’m gone he no longer has a purpose. I will have blood on my hands.

I am going to hell.",StandardJudge8824,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wezwvx/needed_a_surgery_to_save_my_life_it_was_botched/
The only gun in the house being upstairs in my parent's bedroom has saved me more than anything else,"The title explains itself. If there was a pistol, right next to me at all times, I guarantee you I would not be typing this message. I've had more mental breakdowns this past weekend than I've had in fucking months.

These problems don't just come and go for me. They always leave a scar, that I've been refusing to acknowledge for quite some time. Now, I'll acknowledge it. It hurts. Everytime another mental breakdown starts, it always hurts more than the last and makes the scar bigger for it to hurt even more the next time.

It hurts so much that if I was presented with the opportunity to off myself during any point these past few days, I would definitely take that opportunity in a heartbeat. But, it's never presented itself. Always locked away in a closet, in a place I'm not supposed to be in. That fact has singlehandedly done more to prevent my suicide than half the shit I hear coming from others online.

I've given up on most of my goals. I don't feel like preserving myself for any reason whatsoever. I deserve all this shit anyways. I've been a dick to the only people who could save me, and allied with those that beat me down to a bloody pulp. And then there's the fact that I'm worthless. Thousands of people die everyday and the world moves on. Adding to that list won't do anything. In 30 years, those that loved me will have been remember a false version of me, and those that see this post will forget I ever fucking existed in a matter of weeks.

I may indeed be loved, but I haven't been true to anyone in years. They love a cardboard cuttout of a kid who claims to be a man, and they'll remember me as that, even when I'm gone. The truth is, the moment I'll be the most me I will ever be is the moment I pull the trigger and my brains splatter against the wall. That moment will be the one time in my life people will see me for who I am, realize all of the signs and signals I've been throwing at, connect the dots and find my true character, and they'll fucking ignore it.",JockeyField,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wf6czy/the_only_gun_in_the_house_being_upstairs_in_my/

Overdose on sleeping pills,"When you OD on sleepers, do you wind up unconscious before you stop breathing, or is it the other way around?

I want to die,"I'm tired. So tired. It's as if they don't care. It's as if it's all my fault that I'm depressed. It's as if I'm the worst person on the planet. When I have actual dreams of saving the world. I want to save so many people. But no one understands that. No one wants to. Now I don't even feel like saving myself. 

""I want to kill myself"" I say to myself as I rub on the suicide attempt scars on my left arm. I desperately want to do it again. What's stopping me is the possibility that I might survive the attempt again. So I'm currently looking for ways to die instantly. I feel like death is so close to me now. Nothing matters anymore. All I want is to die.",spcjunkie,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wf5s2w/i_want_to_die/
What is happening to me?,"I was getting a bit better. I didn't dream of him last night for the first time since the breakup. I got some of my appetite back.

Then, the moment I was left alone in the house my hands started shaking. My legs are unstable and I can't see clearly. I feel like vomiting. I can't think. It suddenly got super hot for no reason. Took some anxiety pills and hopefully those will help.

I wasn't even thinking of him, there was no trigger. I thought I was getting better. I feel like I'm back to square one and I just wish I had the balls to finally do it.",glamburger42,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wf5gxx/what_is_happening_to_me/
i am a loser with no social life or job so i feel like i should die,"i(17f) have a feeling that people who know me are surprised that i'm still alive. i've been mentally ill since i was a kid so i've been struggling all my life. lately i've been considering suicide and death never felt so close like it does know. there's no reason for me to still be alive. i have no one who loves me, i don't contribute to society bc i have no job, i'm mentally ill and socially inept and i can't even make eye contact, i am always suffering. is there really any reason for me to still be alive? no. i'm just too coward to end it. i'm scared it will just be worse after death. i am spiritual and i believe there is something after death that's why i'm so scared. tbh i'm just praying for someone to choke me to death bc i don't have the guts to end it myself.",aestheticgamer333,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wf5e7y/i_am_a_loser_with_no_social_life_or_job_so_i_feel/

I gave my brother the knife,Me and my youngest brother (12)haven’t  been getting along this week. One of the things he says very often is “I’m going to stab you”he’s of course never serious. One of my more prolific thoughts is that of stabbing my stomach until I’m dead. So when he told me again “I’m going to stab you” I went to the kitchen and got out a butcher knife and handed it to him and told him to do it. He laughed. Did I just mess up my little brother? Am I a terrible terrible person?? I feel awful and shameful inside. Luckily no one in my family knows how much I’m struggling right now. If they did I’m sure I would feel worse than I already do.,imperfectlilac,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/wez08n/i_gave_my_brother_the_knife/
