,CasualConversation,"Context: I'm 21M, teacher is 22F, and cousin is 5M.

Almost two weeks ago I dropped him off at kindergarten orientation class because his parents were unexpectedly busy that morning. After helping him get his stuff into his cubby I was about to leave when he wanted to introduce me to the ""best girl teacher ever""...boy was he right about that title. Stuff happened in between everything and eventually her and I started going out. I have never been in a relationship that has progressed as fast as this one has. In just a span of two weeks she went from being a gorgeous stranger to reminding my forgetful ass to take my ADHD and Vitamin B12 pills in the morning 😭. Not even my lovely parents do that which totally fair. After suffering from recent heartbreak, the death of my grandmother, and suicide of a high school friend, she's been the equation in my life I've so dearly needed in 2022. Just yesterday she sat down with me while I had a much needed, disgusting and overdue bawling session that I was not comfortable having with either my friends of parents. I felt like a baby but fuck was it necessary. We share the same sense of humour, enjoy similar movies, have *nearly identical* Spotify playlists, bond over the same childhood nostalgia. AND not only that but she runs her own part time photography gig which has literally been a goal of mine for years. I have literally found the female version of myself. All on top of that she looks like Audrey Hepburn so you cannot go wrong with that. It makes complete sense that this person would work with and educate little children. Not many people have the patience and maturity for that and I totally see why my cousin likes her so much.

Enough of that. I was always nervous about the whole thing because my cousin looks up to her as his second mother. He literally calls her ""Mrs Mother"" for crying out loud 😂. He sees me as the brother he never had and as a result I was overthinking stuff and worried that he would take it the wrong way or feel weird about it. Don't blame me if this sounds like I'm freaking out over nothing, the last time I was 5 the iPhone didn't even exist and Gerald Ford was still alive, that's how long ago it was. I completely forgot how blissfully unaware of anything complex people that age are. After talking to her about it as well my friends and some strangers online, interestingly enough, we both decided that today we'd ""come clean"" to him at the end of the day that his ""brother and mother"" (literally how he describes us) were K-I-S-S-I-N-G. I dreaded it the entire day during work and on the drive to pick him up but after finally pushing myself, she (yes she, not we lol I was too scared and she decided to get it over with) told him word for word ""your bhai (brother in my Bengali language, which she is also learning) and I are boyfriend/girlfriend"".

To my absolute relief the kid lets out the biggest smile I think I've ever seen from him. He's literally speechless. I ask him what he thinks about it and all he does is jump up and down while laughing and clapping and then runs up to us for a hug. His two favourite people (yes he told me that as well) found happiness in each other. It was the cutest thing I've seen in ages. Even hours later I called his mom and he's still jumping on his bed and calling her ""Mrs Sister"" 🤣. Made me realize he's basically just a big baby and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Even hours later I called his mom and he&amp;#39;s still jumping on his bed and calling her &amp;quot;Mrs Sister&amp;quot; 🤣. Made me realize he&amp;#39;s basically just a big baby and I wouldn&amp;#39;t have it any other way. Sorry if this sounds completely random to you but I&amp;#39;ve been telling everyone I know this so far so might as well fill in the internet strangers who also helped me come to my senses and realize I was overreacting as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

for some reason I was his ''favourite adult''. Like, he wanted to involve me in any kind of activity. For example.. his parents were going on a vacation or going out on a Saturday night?

&lt;p&gt;Anyways enough about me, how are you? What&amp;#39;s on your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been t various ENTs and they believe it’s a result of an ear/sinus infection, Eustachian Tube Dysfunction caused by allergies.  I have days where it’s very faint static, or gone. Other days it’s there and annoying. Only in one ear.

I’m currently on more antibiotics and nasal sprays, mucinex, claritin and have an allergy test scheduled. 

It’s so hard to remain optimistic because this has ruined my life. Can’t eat much because it triggers it. Can’t go out for a few drinks because it triggers it. Can’t go anywhere too loud because it triggers it. I have trouble working because stress triggers it.

I eventually told her I couldn’t keep talking to her as if we were together because I started seeing another girl that I really had feelings for at the time, and am in love with now, and honestly I asked my friend out years ago and she rejected me but now I really am not interested in having a relationship with her outside of friends with benefits because I am not attracted to her in that way.

Anyways occasionally she will text me or call me because she is upset and wants someone to talk to but I usually don’t engage because I honestly don’t really care anymore. I live 3000 miles away and hadn’t seen her for 1.5 years before this summer, so it’s hard for me to really talk to her about such things.

Anyways I was upset about something that happened with the girl Ive been dating now and felt very lonely and depressed about a lot of things because I really don’t have any close friends outside of her where I live.

I ended up texting my friend from back home to see how she’s doing because I know she’s not in the greatest place right now but as I’m talking to her I’m starting to feel like a piece of shit because I don’t care so much and am using it in a way to just talk to someone to cure my own loneliness",t2_kwjpr,False,,0,False,Is it wrong to try and talk to somebody about their feelings and personal life if you are doing it simply for your fulfillment?,[],r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,True,t3_wra8fo,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1660797759.0,text,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically I moved across country but when I went back home for a week earlier this summer I ended up hooking up with a a close friend of mine who told me she had feelings for me (it was kind of random).&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"He's about to be 3 later in August and I like to cuddle him. 

The mother and I aren't together so we switch off each week, maybe 2 or 3 weeks. I'm 26 and am currently living with family at the moment as is his mother, who's around mostly women/girls and a baby cousin. 

When he's here I love to cuddle him alot. He's maturing more and more each time I see him and I know he won't be into cuddles for much much longer. He likes to cuddle when we watch TV; he'll lay/sit next to me into my arm alot. I often hold him while he goes down for his nap and he falls asleep pretty fast; of course I'll put him down after and go do my thing, sometimes he puts himself to sleep for the nap. 

Same with bed time however I tend to kinda chill with him, hold him, let him lay on me sometimes, run my hands through his hair, rub his back, give him kisses and tell him I love him, I'm proud of him, he's great, etc. Sometimes we'll play with my phones flashlight with finger shadows or watch a show. Sometimes read some. 

He usually goes off onto the other side of the bed when he's tired about to really fall asleep so I'll tuck him in with one of his stuffed animals lined up and give him a kiss and let him put himself to sleep. I respect his space and his wants. 

But sometimes during the night I'll come hold him in my arms and give him some forehead kisses and rub his back a little, just watch him dream or talk in his sleep (he's too cute) for a minute/awhile and put him back down on his pillows. 

I dont know, some people could find it weird that a 26 year old father is doing that especially when they're just sleeping but I don't look at it like that, I just love him, want to enjoy the time when I can with him (nothing is promised and no telling when he'll not want to), he's cute and I like to show him affection and give him good vibes and energy while he sleeps; maybe he'll feel them and give him good dreams too. 

I'm just wondering what you guys think? Should I just lay off and save it for the day time with him or should I keep doing so as long as he's comfortable with it? I know parenting differs person to person, family from family, but I just figured I'd get other people's opinions and experiences with this because if I could be stunting his maturing or independence or something that's the last thing I want to do.

I can&amp;#39;t eat even the most mundane things like yogurt without it hurting even more than it already does.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put this in context I had 3 hip surgeries and 2 back surgeries and those were cake walks compared to this. I can handle a lot of pain but this is unreal. When they had pulled all my teeth in one sitting it was this bad. I already went back in so they could put a dressing in the dry socket which did help for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

This is all basically set dressing as I don't exactly remember most of this event but it did actually happen there's a vhs tape somewhere and I shudder to think of what would happen if it was found.

,CasualConversation,"About a month ago, I moved halfway across the country to Seattle. I can't quite explain why, but I've always wanted to be up here in this area. There's a lot of places I've really enjoyed seeing and there's so much I want to do! There are some problems, however. 

First of all, I'm 'homeless'. I got a job lined up before I moved. They were so eager to have a new employee qualified and eager to work in the Northeast that they offered to pay for an extended stay and cover some of my travel costs to start work a month earlier. Fantastic! I jumped on the idea, already with a few places in mind to move into, and took the opportunity to relax and take some extra time to find a good place to live. 

Things were going great! Unfortunately, as I started the last week of my stay, Everything up here runs a credit check before renting and mine came back with over $2000 owed to collections that I was totally unaware of. Part of it I totally forgot, part I thought had already been taken care of, but more than half was from an apartment three years ago that has given me more grief than anything. With that on my credit, my applications have all been denied. 

A week later, all of my debts are paid. Unfortunately, the company will not pay for my housing any longer. I travel a lot and have the opportunity to stay at hotels with the company *most nights*, but it's impossible for them to justify it every night. I got a great deal on a few hotel rooms on the weekends, but I don't have any permanent home. 

My car registration is due next month, but without an address, i can't register it. I i broke my phone and can't get it replaced until Friday. I felt like I was so careful and had everything in order. I had $6000 before I moved, but it's quickly running low, especially if you consider rent and the deposit I need for a place.

,CasualConversation,I remember hearing as a kid that Toy Story took five years to make. For some reason I misheard it as 5000 years. I had this image of a man with a beard and a robe in ancient Mesopotamia declaring a new thing called a movie would be created and it would be about toys secretly being alive. I then pictured generations of people slowly working on it throughout the years. I also pictured kings in the Middle Ages and people later on in the 1700s being sad they wouldn’t live to see Toy Story even though it was mostly complete. I pictured the camera being invented in the 20th century and the inventor being excited that thousands of years of work could finally be filmed as the ancient people predicted.

I had this image of a man with a beard and a robe in ancient Mesopotamia declaring a new thing called a movie would be created and it would be about toys secretly being alive. I then pictured generations of people slowly working on it throughout the years. I also pictured kings in the Middle Ages and people later on in the 1700s being sad they wouldn’t live to see Toy Story even though it was mostly complete. I pictured the camera being invented in the 20th century and the inventor being excited that thousands of years of work could finally be filmed as the ancient people predicted.

,CasualConversation,"I’ve been considering adopting a kitten for a long time. I’m living on campus and my doctor has recommended an ESA because of my severe anxiety/ADHD/OCD. 

Today I went to a shelter. I told myself I wasn’t going to get attached, because I had a rescue kitten have to be put down recently and I didn’t want to go through that heartbreak again. 

Oh, boy. I got to the shelter and sat down with this kitten named Poseidon. Before I even got there he was meowing at me, stretching, leaning against the glass, standing up against the glass with his fluffy little belly pushed against it. When I got back with him, he just purred. I picked him up and held him and pet him and he just purred. He was so calm. And when I had to finally leave, I put him down, and he watched me for a second, then went to lay back down and sleep, still purring. I walked out and immediately filled out the adoption application. 

Man. I’m in love with this little dude. He’s so chill. But he loves playing still. He thought my keys were awesome. He’s just a little dude. He deserves so much love. I want to give him everything. I feel like I would break the world for him. 

I have to turn in the paperwork to disability services tomorrow morning to finish the adoption process. But man. I’ve already started kitten-proofing everything. I’ve started planning to bring him to DND games until he’s comfortable being home alone for a few hours. I’ve started making sure my room is safe for him to be in. I feel like I’m a parent waiting for an adoption to go through. 

I just have so much love in my heart for this little guy. So much. I don’t know what to do with it all. I know if my application gets denied it’s because he’s going to a better home—which is what’s most important.

,CasualConversation,"And let me tell you, it was SO AWESOME! My dad and I saw one of my favorite girl groups, LOONA, down in Louisville on Saturday. We left at 1:30, stopped at a Wal-Mart for some new clothes, and drove on and arrived at the hotel around 5:00. We got showered and dressed for the show, and arrived at 6:50.

Before the show started, I decided to go to the merchandise stand. I got a baby version of the group’s lightstick, and it even has a clip attatched so you can put it on your keychain, and you bet I was waving that thing around all night! The show started at 7:30, and people went WILD when the girls got on stage.

Every single song was amazing. Pale Blue Dot, Wow, Heat, Dance On My Own, all perfect. I’ve even found new appreciation for songs that I wasn’t as crazy about, like So What or Paint the Town. 
The only part that stunk was that one of the members, Choerry, had to bow out of the show early since she wasn’t feeling so well.

That’s another thing that was amazing: the girls! LOONA is a Korean group, and this is their first ever world tour, and the first time they’ve performed outside of Korea in a few years. The members were super friendly with everyone, and a lot of the members spoke in English. Near the end of the concert, one of the members, Heejin, waved at me!

,CasualConversation,"It's a frustrating experience. Some more mainstream things I often fixate on are Donkey Kong, Pikmin, and TF2 - all of these things have hundreds of thousands of fanart, discussion, quality videos, ROM hacks or mods, merchandise, podcasts, and most importantly large communities of people equally as obsessed as me who want to discuss these things and are open to hearing my thoughts on them.

What I'm really into right now is this VR game called Gorilla Tag. To keep a long story short, it's basically a VR game where you play tag as a gorilla, except the only way to move is by hitting your hands onto the walls/floor  to propel yourself. It's one of the greatest games ever made IMO and I think in the future it'll be recognized as an important turning point in the history of VR gaming and maybe even gaming as a whole. 

It does have over 4 million downloads and upwards of 60,000 people playing daily, but here's the catch - in my 130 hours of playing this game, I think I've come across exactly 5 people who are over the age of 18. As a result, in game conversations are entirely with children, the YouTube side of things is 99% mediocre boring YouTube non-content (""Me playing with fans!"" or ""Gorilla tag but if I fart the video ends!!!!""), the reddit side of things is all but dead and what little content is posted is typically repetitive and obviously posted by children, the discord is so populated that chat scrolls by rapidly and trying to have an actual conversation is pointless and these kids don't want to have the types of conversations I want to have. 

Worst of all it seems like no adults out there have even heard of it. I've brought it up to a lot of people, and before I can even begin talking about it I have to explain the game, the premise, why it's fun, etc. and I don't wanna just go on and on for hours so after the long intro I typically pick up on them not wanting to hear about it any more.

Some more mainstream things I often fixate on are Donkey Kong, Pikmin, and TF2 - all of these things have hundreds of thousands of fanart, discussion, quality videos, ROM hacks or mods, merchandise, podcasts, and most importantly large communities of people equally as obsessed as me who want to discuss these things and are open to hearing my thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m really into right now is this VR game called Gorilla Tag. To keep a long story short, it&amp;#39;s basically a VR game where you play tag as a gorilla, except the only way to move is by hitting your hands onto the walls/floor  to propel yourself. It&amp;#39;s one of the greatest games ever made IMO and I think in the future it&amp;#39;ll be recognized as an important turning point in the history of VR gaming and maybe even gaming as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does have over 4 million downloads and upwards of 60,000 people playing daily, but here&amp;#39;s the catch - in my 130 hours of playing this game, I think I&amp;#39;ve come across exactly 5 people who are over the age of 18. As a result, in game conversations are entirely with children, the YouTube side of things is 99% mediocre boring YouTube non-content (&amp;quot;Me playing with fans!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Gorilla tag but if I fart the video ends!!!!&amp;quot;), the reddit side of things is all but dead and what little content is posted is typically repetitive and obviously posted by children, the discord is so populated that chat scrolls by rapidly and trying to have an actual conversation is pointless and these kids don&amp;#39;t want to have the types of conversations I want to have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst of all it seems like no adults out there have even heard of it. I&amp;#39;ve brought it up to a lot of people, and before I can even begin talking about it I have to explain the game, the premise, why it&amp;#39;s fun, etc. and I don&amp;#39;t wanna just go on and on for hours so after the long intro I typically pick up on them not wanting to hear about it any more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my hyperactive brain just buzzes about these things and wishes I could get these thoughts out. It sucks! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have anything like that in your life? What is it? Tell me a little bit about it, I&amp;#39;d love to hear!&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"A while ago, i think a few days ago I made this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/wlxmfn/im_thinking_about_locking_myself_in_my_room_for

It was brought on by an already persistent solitary isolation that evolved into maybe some sort of psychosis that increasingly made me paranoid and detached from the outside.

Idk why i thought it'd be BETTER if I isolated myself MORE.

Thankfully in my moments having seen this as a casual subreddit I casually explained my idea in case I wasn't applying proper judgement.

Thank God cause the post probably hit a nerve in a lot of people that caringly advised me to not go for it at all as it might be detrimental to me physically and mentally with maybe long term effects.

I got scared cause I was already isolating myself a lot.

So the next day, I went outside and bicycled.

I did the same next day too only this time I reached out to some friends and played and basketball in the evening

The next day I reached out to the same friend from above and went with him to a sports club and met a lot of new faces and ran a fucking lot!

And today I went to bicycle again and chased the evening setting sun.

I'm aware I can fall back into the tendencies of wanting to isolate myself but I'll be so much more cautious. I'm so scared thinking what was i thinking?

I could have really fucked my brain health and set myself back so much and turn out miserable even at the end of the year.

,CasualConversation,"Let’s go with Aladdin rules of no multiplying wishes, no resurrection, and no falling in love. (I feel like the only really important rule is the first but we’ll keep it classic. Also feel free to skip or skim over my ramblings below and just give your answers, as I definitely got pretty carried away.) 

I know this has been asked so many times before, but I always find it fun to read through people’s thoughts and wishes, and to ponder mine. 

Personally, even though I think about it way too often, I just really don’t know. My first thoughts are always to maximize my wishes in some way, so sometimes I think my first wish would be to be all knowing, that way I could be better informed for my next two wishes. But like… I feel like that’d break my brain. I already suffer from having too-zoomed out a world view, where it feels like most everyday things are just meaningless since our existence is hardly a speck in terms of time and space. 

I would love the ability to control the weather, because I love things like rain and storms and wind and fun cloud formations. But Im 100% positive I would accidentally fuck everything up and cause untold devastation because I was feeling particularly moody and wanted to experience a hurricane. 

It also feels to me that no matter how positive I could try to make my wishes, there would somehow be a lot of negative consequences. And so many technicalities. I’d love to wish for world peace for instance, but what all does that entail? Is it just no violence, or no disagreement? Because we kinda need disagreement for progression. And as much of a peace loving person as I am, I still recognize that there have been times where violence may have been called for, or something that some view as violent others view as part of life, like hunting for instance, which humans have been doing for many tens of thousands of years. Even something as specific as “no violence between humans” could have consequences that we’ve never considered, because we’ve never not had interpersonal violence. 

And then there are answers that don’t break the wishing rules but could break the rules of physics and the universe. Like the ability to form and control atoms or control time or something. Would be fun to play around with, but that’s an insane amount of power that again, could have powerful consequences.

,CasualConversation,"This was many years ago, I think I was like 19 or something like that. 

Some context to start. I used to live in a very small apartment complex next to a very expensive gated house community. This community had the fame of being a place where criminals would live since it’s been historically quite expensive, and so most people tried to not get involved as to not get into trouble. 

One day I noticed one of the houses had a chained colombian red howler monkey on their rooftop. These monkeys are wild animals and it is illegal to keep them as pets. 

I wanted to report this to the environmental police, but I wanted to do it anonymously because, as I mentioned, that community was rumored to be inhabited by criminals, and if they were willing to keep a wild animal as a pet despite it being illegal, I did not want to risk it and let it be known it was me who reported it. 

I needed the address, which was easy to get, and I needed the house number, which wasn’t as easy because I couldn’t see it by myself (there were shrubs and vegetation covering the fence that divided our complex from their community), and I was scared to ask the guard at the guard. 

One evening I saw a couple of kids playing next to the fence, so I got an idea. We have a dachshund dog that my sister and I would take out on walks around a complex, and there was a small hole in the fence next to where the kids where playing, so I told the kids that my dog escaped through that dog and asked them if they’d seen a little black long dog. When they said no, I told them that I saw him running towards that house with the monkey, and then asked if they’d be so kind to tell me the number of the house; they did, and so I was able to report it and no more than a week later the monkey was gone. 

It was later on that I realized how creepy I had been with the kids.

,CasualConversation,"Whenever I’m in a situation where I want to overcome something and struggle imagining getting myself getting there sooner, I always remind myself how I was at a place where my skin was in poor condition. Had acne all over my forehead blemishes and dark spots all over my face and I’d look at girls giving skin advice and feeling like it would take me years to have clear skin. But I never gave up, I did my research, I tried different products out, I tried things I doubted or never thought about and over time it was something I overcame and throughout my journey I hardly noticed the gradual changes. My whole life I just felt so unlucky with anything I did and couldn’t imagine myself better unless it was a dream.

Sometimes when I want something so bad I want it now because I feel like I’m currently missing out on something wonderful.

Don’t know who needs to read this but you are getting better every day. You may not see a difference now but you’ll be too busy and too focused on your life and the things you do to notice. It’s like sitting in a long car ride on a road trip. You’re too focused on looking at the environment, driving or reading a book to worry too much how long it will take to get there.

,CasualConversation,"I (20M) was having a conversation with a family friend (55F) whom I occasionally hang out with and talk to.

I've been working at my old childhood elementary school for the last 2 years, basically since graduating high school, and now I'm moving up into a higher paying job at a different school.

I work with all ages, but the kids I've always liked to work with the most are the younger ones in preschool, kindergarten, or first grade. Their innocence and general sweetness/cuteness genuinely feels therapeutic to be around. I would always try to make time to go play with the little ones during recess or lunch, and they loved it. One game they LOVED for a long time was being cops holding me captive in pretend jail, for a sentence of ""forever"" or 100 years.

She already knew all of that, but I also opened up about my family's past history of trauma: dad started dating mom fresh outta jail in 1998, and was on drugs when I was a newborn infant, my older brother (31) went down a path from age 10 or so of being easily angered and aggressive, and eventually getting into drugs as an adult, my big sister (then 19, now 33) died when I was 5, parents marriage started deteriorating when I was 6, my dad got back into ice when I was 9, lots of fights and screaming and stuff being thrown, and then my parents divorced and it took my dad 9 years (2012 to 2021) to come back to our hometown after he moved away to get clean (because my mom said she wouldn't let him see me anymore if he didn't). 

It wasn't so much being afraid or being in physical danger that got to me, as it was just being around constant shouting, anger, conflict, and negative energy. 

And the kicker thing is: the kids I work with that I tend to have the strongest bonds with and spend the most time with and get the most hugs from? I would come to learn overtime that those are the ones that are currently growing up in families with constant anger and shouting and negative energy, just like mine. I can name at least 3 or 4 right off the top of my head, and this school has 85 kids (its one of 4 elementary schools in a town of 7,500).

Basically, the conclusion she came to is that the reason why I love playing and helping out with little kids as much as I do is because I don't want any of them to grow up with the kinda angry/toxic stuff I saw with my family as a little kid, seeing them smiling, laughing, and knowing that I make them happy and have a positive effect on their lives gives me a sense of self worth, and being around their innocence and kindness gives me a safe haven to be free from the negativity of the world.

And hearing that honestly just made me tear up. I feel like I just unlocked my entire purpose in life.

She also said that she thinks the Asperger's diagnosis I was given as a 3yo to explain why I was always screaming and crying as a baby, always seemed sensitive to everything and scared of everything, and hardly talked to people as a toddler, probably wasn't autism *at all*.

 i don't know when it happened, but i decided enough was enough, and stopped caring, then unfollowed people who's posts i had despised viewing. lots of friends of friends, family friends, the usual suspects on instagram. my feed is now what I want to see and not what instagram wants me to see. i also went through and unfollowed anyone i didn't really know or talk to on twitter, and straight up deactivated my facebook account entirely. reddit's a nicer park since you choose what communities you're in unlike facebook and instagram.

,CasualConversation,"I've been applying for vet school, so lately I've been doing a lot of thinking about my life and what led me to where I am. I can't write about this particular experience in my application because they discourage talking about childhood, pre-high school stuff. Even if I could, I also don't think it would be the most relevant story to tell in my application. 

So I thought I would share here:

I had a friend from 4th-6th grade who was super passionate about gray wolves and her enthusiasm about it was freaking infectious. She even convinced me to try and send an email to the President at the time about gray wolf conservation, which I was literally about to do until my parents convinced me otherwise. I carry that passion with me still today and a lot of the things I love like camping and the outdoors (Hunger Games was so big at the time, we tried to do a full reenactment of the Games in the woods) came from spending that time with her and the rest of that friend group. 

We're still friends to this day, I moved to a different school after 6th grade but we reconnected at the end of college. It was like no time had passed, which is pretty crazy because that rarely happens in all the friendships I have had. We're on very drastically different career paths at the moment and she's going to school in a different country, so I feel a bit sad that it'll probably never be the same as it was but happy that it happened. 

I really hope she knows what a positive impact she had on my life and how grateful I am to have her friendship.

1) Why is there an automatic upvote when you post or comment and are you supposed to remove it after doing so?

2) Do upvotes hold more weight than a ""like""  on other social media platforms or pretty much the same?

3) explain awards?

,CasualConversation,"I recognized very early on that I could’ve been born anything or anyone. That no matter what form I could’ve taken on this earth, I will experience pain. Being able to walk, see, and perceive was amazing to me. To be the eyes and the ears for trees, both a giver and receiver of the oxygen I breathe. I realized it is a privilege I get to experience earth in this form. As early as 1st grade, after learning of the stunning probability that went into me meeting this world, I can remember feeling gratitude for everything that came before me that made it possible for me to even be here.

So many adults fear death and inflict unnecessary pain on to others- not necessarily for the pain they inflict to cope with their own pain, but for the time they’ve wasted of others that neither parties will ever get back. Sometimes the things they do to cope with death and fear often inspire more fear and so the circle continues. Nobody wants to leave this place but finding a way to be okay with it through gratitude for all the hard work and all the time the universe, nature, and people gave of themselves just for me to walk makes me so happy, even if I could only exist for a day. And to realize in 1st grade that I get to wake up and explore the very soil that birthed me for far more than just a few days? Such a basic fact left me in awe of my sheer luck. This perspective helps me navigate extremely rough circumstances. It affords me so much more room to understand my surroundings/ be able to give a healthy dose of benefit of the doubt to others. I get so much more out of my life no matter how much pain is inflicted on me or witnessed because I get to live inside this brain that affords me so much. Because of this perspective, my physical neurological pathways feel that people’s actions and the pain they inflict physically and mentally do not belong to me, therefore they can’t physically hurt me entirely. I wonder what I’d do or how much more pain I’d be in if I hadn’t formed this ideology/ approach to life. Therefore I cannot judge because I do not know what it’s like inside another’s head.

Does anyone here feel some adults make their fear of death their child’s problem? 

-To then inspire their children to fear death through showcasing unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking or abuse in order to find control? 

Everyone loathes the idea of leaving but not everyone practices unhealthy coping mechanisms. Does anyone here not fear death entirely and want to make space for their children to not fear it too?

I don’t mean “oh the chorus of this one song has some clean vocals” I mean, the band almost always uses clean or cleanish vocals.

I did. No response. r/music basically just mocked me, and r/swedishdeathmetal just downvoted me to oblivion. So, I thought I'd try the friendlier side of reddit. The funny thing is the band that pioneered guttural vocals was *Death*. Chuck Shuldinger was their frontman and song writer, and his last album before his untimely death (aged 34, brain tumor) was an all-clean vocal deathmetal album under his sideproject: Control Denied. I guess you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain?

edit: basically other examples of this: [Desultor - Swedish Death Metal w/ Clean Vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiDH0CfguD4)",t2_eb2ez,False,,0,False,Are there any recommendations for death metal (particularly swedish death metal) with clean vocals?,"[{'a': ':note:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/u2vvr9ge8a801_t5_323oy/note'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Music'}]",r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,False,t3_wp2jcq,False,light,0.91,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:note: Music,False,9,,False,False,,1660589791.0,,[],{},,True,,1660577427.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love thrash metal and how it’s almost entirely clean or cleanish raspy (like kill ‘em all style, or repentless album slayer) vocals&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"We’ve reached a point where an attractive woman with a stomach roll or two will position themselves as a body positivity martyr; where they will upload a photo without a filter (still from a flattering angle); where they will reveal themselves looking slightly bloated after dinner and get flooded with adulatory comments commending their bravery - in many cases it’s a form of virtue signalling, and I feel it only exacerbates the underlying issues, and causes beauty standards to feel even harsher than they are. 

Consider: If a conventionally above average looking woman has built her entire online persona around flaunting her two rolls of fat and three cellulite dimples and consequently been praised to high heaven, how rotten must a conventionally unattractive woman who’s considerably overweight feel? If the good looking woman has forged her image around having slightly asymmetrical breasts and small love handles then the unattractive woman showing any skin at all is automatically considered a sign of bravery, right? It’s indirectly reaffirming what she already bloody sees every time she catches herself in a reflection:  she’s so very far from being conventionally physically desirable - how is this helpful in any way? 

So then, how should somebody with a sincere body positive mindset help to redress the harsh societal beauty paradigm? They could start by dropping the body positive bullshit in their bio, by refraining from appending every post with a glib sentence about self love, by not pinching their belly rolls in every goddamn photo and hyper focusing on the fact that they aren’t physically impeccable according to the beauty paradigm or drawing attention to the fact that they aren’t using a filter, and instead just uploading photos which tacitly demonstrate this real confidence.

,CasualConversation,"Most people claim night shift is terrible, people would even try to talk me out of switching over because they assumed I'd hate it. Even in night shift facebook groups it seems nightshift is generally disliked and seen as only a plus because theres usually a pay differential. I know im obviously not, but it feels like I'm the only one who genuinely prefers it lol. 

Day shift was brutal for me. I was constantly exhausted. I'd get up, go to work, and when I got home I didnt have the energy to do anything. I would be fighting to keep my eyes open all day, and by the time I got home it would be a losing battle. I lived off of lean cuisines, everyday I would zombie trudge to the microwave to heat up my daily meal. But at the same time, I would lay awake at night because my brain just wouldnt drift off to sleep. I needed heavy combination of sleeping pills just to get any form of sleep. I still take .5 mg of xanax to sleep because my tinnitus &amp; brain just not shutting off keeps me up for hours if I dont, but it's *much* less heavy than what I used to take. 

I started working overnights in May and it has been life changing. I work 11 PM - 7:30 AM.

This is usually my schedule now (obviously it can vary but this is the basic outline):

- 8 AM: Arrive home. Make my husband a breakfast or salad wrap (he is a truck driver and works long days, he usually wakes up and goes directly to work so I make something he can quickly grab and eat). Refill my bunny's supply of hay. 

-9 AM: Go to bed

-11 AM: Husband leaves for work, since his alarm usually wakes me up too I get up to shower or whatever quick thing I have to do before going back to bed (like if I'm making chicken and vegetables, I'll marinate the defrosted chicken and put it back in the fridge. If I need groceries, I'll send a curbside pickup order) 

-3 or 4 PM: Wake up. Head to the grocery store to pick up the order. Pass time by watching TV or playing video games. 

-6 PM: Begin cooking dinner. Other housework that has to be done like change bunny's litter box if it needs to be, take out trash, fold laundry I didnt get to. 

-7 or 8 PM (depending on when I finish): Pass more time

-9 PM: Start getting ready for work, make my sandwich (even if I cook I bring a sandwich, my husband gets home atleast an hour after I leave and he has a big appetite since he doesn't have a chance to eat from being in a truck all day, if theres leftovers I bring them to work the next day), feed my bunnies their dinner salad. 

My biggest concern with the desire to start cooking was thinking of things to make everyday but I caught on quickly with coming up and keeping track of my ideas. I still deal with bad fatigue, honestly on my days off I usually sleep in until the time I usually cook dinner (besides getting up to change out the laundry, days off are laundry day) then go back for another nap around 4 AM.

It literally started in April/slash May, when i was stressed out to the max about the last months of school, packed to death with homework and study but gods know when i looked out of the window of the bus and saw the sunrise...everything looked so beautiful.  Everything and everyone and  i felt happy to be there, sitting there, revising for the test of the day or reading a love novel with my friend to my side.

Like, love is all around us, and we don't even realize it. Love is my mom who wakes in the middle of the night because she cant sleep and still comes to cheek on me in my room even if I am all grown up now, and she tucked me in if I kicked my blankets of while sleeping. Or my dad who every time we go to the store still looks for my favorite ice cream even if we are pretty sure they don't sell it anymore. Love is when my friends and I call each other even if we are all kilometers apart and stay on call for hours on hours laughing till our bellies hurt. Or me and my classmate, I know she is a history nerd so every time I see something cool I send it to her and she sends me back things about knitting or the best love stories she could find knowing how much I love it and we can rant to each other about our fields of interest for a whole day if you let us. Love is also making water and mint syrup for myself and watching a comedy when I am sad.

There is so much kindness too, like when my cousins and I saw this woman shop for clothes alone and clearly having a bad time, looking all sad and insecure in the fitting room and we started hyping her up for half an hour, or when my buddy and I were freshmen, first-year Latin students and one of the older ones on the buss lead us in chanting the first declination because we kept messing up and he wanted us to revise well before our lesson. Or the kind lady at the bookstores who always gives me the best records even when i don't ask for them.

,CasualConversation,"In Asian culture, an offspring's behavior and conduct are often a reflection of their parents or guardians. It is shameful to be rude or cause unnecessary disruptions in public because it is considered disrespectful to one's parents.

I believe the collectivist ideals and elements of East Asian culture have been ingrained upon me at a very young age.

Another interesting cultural concept is called ""Saving Face.""  This concept essentially boils down to keeping others from losing respect for oneself or to avoid embarrassment. 

This is why Japanese people in modern times are known for their humility and respectful behaviors towards others. 

For me, whenever I see an Asian who is rude and disrespectful, I immediately direct my judgement towards the parents. In my mind, it may be that this hypothetical person's parents did not raise them properly. This is a contrast to U.S. American culture, but as someone who was raised in an Asian household, it was what I was taught. My parents would always point out a bad person on the news as Asian if they were of Asian descent.

It is shameful to be rude or cause unnecessary disruptions in public because it is considered disrespectful to one&amp;#39;s parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the collectivist ideals and elements of East Asian culture have been ingrained upon me at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting cultural concept is called &amp;quot;Saving Face.&amp;quot;  This concept essentially boils down to keeping others from losing respect for oneself or to avoid embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Japanese people in modern times are known for their humility and respectful behaviors towards others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, whenever I see an Asian who is rude and disrespectful, I immediately direct my judgement towards the parents. In my mind, it may be that this hypothetical person&amp;#39;s parents did not raise them properly. This is a contrast to U.S. American culture, but as someone who was raised in an Asian household, it was what I was taught. My parents would always point out a bad person on the news as Asian if they were of Asian descent. That was the first thing that they zero in on because the notion of Asians behaving badly is not something that is normal to them.&lt;/p&gt;

It absolutely baffles me how fast some people have made friends. I was at a SA event and I was grouped with 3 girls and a guy.

But I was there too. What the fuck did I do wrong?!?! I don't get it. Throw me a bone please, I'm trying to make friends and stop being a boring, lonely loser but I can't.

Today I went to play football with a friend from class. The one person who talked to me in school. He plays football with a group of friends he knows from high school. I'm not very athletic but I'm working on it. So I sucked. And I felt embarrassed that I was bad. They're all fit dudes who watch football, they all go to the gym and have abs and then there's me.

,CasualConversation,"I was looking through the big bookshelf (entire wall in a big room) in my parent's house, and saw a badly damaged comic book I remember from childhood days. The title was in Sütterlin script, a writing I once learned reading and writing but forgot by now, the comic titles are in Gothic script (Both sütterlin and Gothic script were banned in 1941 and not reintroduced past 1945). I googled the name of the comic and realized it must have been 1940 as that was the only year these comics were published as book. I'm not sure how this comic book ended in our family, as by 1940 my father as the oldest child was too young for this. Maybe my grandparents or he bought the comic book much later.

It was the ""5 Schreckensteiner"" - Three paintings on a wall with 5 ancestors / relatives (one woman, one boy and three men) of the current lord of a castle. Every night between midnight and 1 am the people in the painting come to live (they are well aware of their surroundings all day though) to play pranks, do everyday things or secretly help the lord of the castle.

,CasualConversation,"It means that we can actually make quantum pong!!

If holywood has though me anything, It's that everything is cooler if the name begins with quantum.

Now I think almost everyone has seen that picture of the people who made the first pong machine.
It's iconic. But... It's not quantum iconic.
So I see a golden oportunity to be forever quantum cool.

we might have to solve a small tiny problem before we become quantum famous however.
Appearantly and unfortunately, quantum computers now, are basicly normal computers in the 1950s, Meaning they're:
- room sized, (and more like living room then bedroom)
- expensive af,
- lacking on the actuall ""computing"" side of things.
- pretty much addicted to Electricity (Like these badboys are gobbling those watts like candy. And boy, do they like candy)

Oh and also...
Appearantly a quantum computer can do exactly 1 thing, one calculation. It can do that 1 thing very fast. But That's it.
And to make pong work we need to be able to do at least 450 things.

We can still link quantum computers together though, connected to eachother via those lame ass normal computers. (jegh)
And we'd need a reasonably sized flat to house all of them (and also probably like a bazillion dollars).
But then we would officially be quantum famous.

So I guess I'm looking for volunteers... a lot of em actually, and preferably rich and bad with money.

Now let me remind you, even if you just transport the computers, You will officially be the first Quantum transporter.
Are you connecting cabbles? Boom. Quantum engineer.
Are you stacking the room sized quantum computers? Zaboom. Quantum crane operator.

,CasualConversation,"For most of this year I really wanted to be a streamer on twitch. I wanted it all. Followers, validation, love, fame. I thought of streaming myself playing games or making YouTube videos. I planned tons of things out and tried to get ready for it all once I moved into my own apartment. 

And then I moved. Then I started getting caught up in streamer drama on Twitter, reading about what someone said or worrying if that would happen to me. Seeing streamers make content every day and having to keep that energy. It didn’t seem fun to me, just stressful. Especially with my desire for not being doxxed or harassed. 

I’d rather just play a game with friends than talk to myself in my room worrying about what faceless strangers think of me. I don’t want to come home from work just to stream. I want options. I want to do my own thing and not care about what others think. I don’t need to be “somebody” I just want to be myself. And “myself” is just a guy who likes watching documentaries, watching anime, reading books, painting warhammer models, and playing video games. Sometimes interacting with streamers discords or streams, too. 

I still have my Twitter, but I don’t go on it much at all anymore because I don’t like drama. And I’m still on Reddit, but just to interact with communities with games I play for advice or memes. 

I don’t want to monetize my happiness or make something I find fun a chore. Streaming wouldn’t be fun so why would I do it?

How did a single bag of Top Ramen remain in his pantry for 2 years with out being eaten (bc they are delicious)? Idk. Why didn’t I see any mold in my soup if it’s 2 years old? Idk. Am I going to die from eating expired Top Ramen? Probably. So many questions… yet so few answer.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Well, I'll start by saying I never thought I would post anything like this. I recall seeing similar posts (mostly on quitting social media) and not going past the title, but here goes. I haven't been using social media for the past like 10 years (I think I had a purge more than 8 years ago), but I never was a social media guy in the first place so I really didn't care.

Now my situation is different. I have been working all the time since the beginning on the year (working two jobs simultaneously plus some side hustles) and recently I moved to one new job (very demanding time and effort wise). Since the beginning of the year there pretty much has been no breaks, just working continuously. By the end of the day I'm so exhausted (and work is still on my mind, most times I end up taking work home with me which I do after a short rest or wake up early morning to finish it and work often on weekends) I just eat whatever and lay down on bed on my phone.   

Here is the issue, I have been pushing through over the past few months just by will and brute force (and thinking to myself this would get better or I'll eventually get used to it, but it didn't), but I feel I'm getting close to my limit. I have been doing a disservice to my body and social/family relations all while feeling mediocre at my current job (though this is probably because I'm still new). So finish work for the day, go to the room I'm renting and use my phone.

Today is Sunday. I'll reply to the comments if any, do my work and watch YouTube today. When Monday comes no more YouTube or generally using electronic to waste time. At that point I'll see how much time I'm actually wasting and decide what to invest in (most probably more sleep and physical activity as they are on top of the list, but I'll decide by the end of the week).

Preface:
Yesterday I drove to Nashville to go see the red hot chili peppers (amazing show- could go on and on about that but that probably doesn't belong here) and I stayed the night with my friends that are engaged. This morning we got up, had coffee, cut up a fresh watermelon, and made some good toast with this nice whole wheat brand. One of them asked if we wanted bacon as well and started to make some. Naturally, when I think of cooking bacon, I think of frying it up or baking it in the oven. Now no judgment here whatsoever, everyone has their own way of doing things and that's totally fine. I've just never seen anyone take raw bacon, put some paper towel around it, and microwave it until done (a few minutes) so it struck me as odd. But I was curious and hungry so I ate my two pieces. 

It had an slightly odd off putting smell and taste to it. It was pretty tough and chewy in a weird way. I didn't say anything or ask because I was grateful of their hospitality they had shown me and it really wasn't a big deal. And we're really close, it's the type of thing I'll bring up next time we hang out and ask if they've always cooked it like that and we'll laugh and talk over it.

,CasualConversation,"When I'm bored or not doing anything, I like to stare into nothingness. Sometimes, while listening to music. It's fine when I'm doing it in my room since I can go on for however long I want it to be. But after some time, it gets suffocating inside the 4 walls of what should be my safe space. So then, I have to go out atleast once a week to refresh my mind. Either I go by the harbour, or the mall, usually the latter. My routine is pretty simple, go to the mall, eat, buy clothes (once per month is what my allowance allows me to), and then finally rest in a coffee shop for a few hours before going home.

I like coffee, not like a hipster, or a connoisseur, I just like it like the average person. I like it, but for some reason, it messes up something in me, like I become more aware of everything around me, or a feeling like something bad may happen to me, and then I'd feel like shit/sick a few hours later. What I do like about it is the act of drinking it. I like taking my time when drinking coffee, it takes me atleast 1.5 hours before I finish one venti sized coffee.

Again, I like staring into nothingness alot, that includes when I'm drinking coffee. But unlike when I'm in my room, I can't do it in my pace, in public.  Because there's people around me. I know they're not looking at me but sometimes when they do, I know they're thinking that I'm weird staring into the void, alone. It did happen back in 9th grade, after our semester break, I remember going back to the classroom just staring into... well, nothing. My classmate noticed me from a distance and then he snapped me back to reality and saying ""hey, you've been zoning out for atleast 15 minutes now, are you okay?"" Then I laughed and said yeah mb.

I like staring into nothingness, i think its more meta than forcefully closing my eyes, somehow, that is more tiring. When zoning out I occasionally find out that i have been staring at someone without me knowing. Thats why it messes me up. What if I was accidentally looking at someone? They will think im weird, im into them, and then what? Ill end up in social media either having sad music and the caption is about a guy being alone, or a pervert staring at me.

Sometimes, I imagine having the power of clipping out of reality whenever I want, or being invisible. So then nobody would judge me for being weird and staring carelessly.

,CasualConversation,"I have been thinking about this a couple of times now (this is mostly past related to make it less complicated) :

Is there a feasable way to percieve time? We all know that time passes and can see it happen in front of us but can we really determine how time works?

This would be directly linked (?) with the concept of time travel (I like this topic). The way time travel would or wouldn’t work highly depends on the way time actually works:

1.A fixed timeline where everything that has ever and will ever happen has (somehow) ben predetermined, even occurences of time travel (a good example for this would be the time watch thing from one of the harry potter moovies)

2. No fixed timeline, your decisions influence the current state of your timeline, this can take various different forms:

2.1 its always one continuous line, time travel creates an infinite loop, you time traveling causes the version of you that time traveled to never have existed in the first place (override of your timeline) causing you to never have traveled to the past and change the timeline.

2.2 alternatively you could create a branch timeline (no override) where you decided to time travel to causing you to be an extra in this time (since you‘re from another version of reality).

,CasualConversation,"Most people play to win the toys, and truth is I don’t really care for the toys.

When I win, I keep (maybe) one that I get.
I give the rest away to anyone who wants it, mainly little kids or teenagers. People that I typically find in the arcade.

I play because I’m good at it, and I feel the smile on little kid’s faces are rewarding enough. 
For example, last year in Lake Tahoe, I came across a little kid from an Asian family (they didn’t speak English too well, and he was maybe six) and he seemed bummed he didn’t win the pickle Rick plushie he wanted. I gave him mine, smiled and turned away to play Mrs. Pac-Man in the retro part of the arcade. 
Later he came with his parents, who promptly tried to hand me a $20. I refused three times until they put it in my hand and left. 

I grew up slightly poor. I’m only 16, and while we’re even more financially stable, I get nervous with money just being spent willy nilly. 
So when that family had me take the twenty and left, I almost broke down. 

Today I one a bunch of stuffed animals at a pizza place and handed one to every little kid at a birthday party. Before we left, the birthday girl came and handed my sister and me one of those bite sized cupcakes.

&lt;p&gt;I grew up slightly poor. I’m only 16, and while we’re even more financially stable, I get nervous with money just being spent willy nilly. 
So when that family had me take the twenty and left, I almost broke down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I one a bunch of stuffed animals at a pizza place and handed one to every little kid at a birthday party. Before we left, the birthday girl came and handed my sister and me one of those bite sized cupcakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I may not want anything physical like Money or Cupcakes, seeing people happy just makes my day. 
At least I make my claw machine fixation worth while.&lt;/p&gt;

-We don’t indent first sentences of a paragraph within email (like we did for college papers).

-College doesn’t tell you that the business world mainly uses Window operating systems (macOS user his whole life).

-Keyboard short-cuts are life changing.

-Excel is pretty universal and can be beneficial for your job, even if your tasks don’t require it.

-Outlook, Adobe, &amp; MS Suite are pretty universal too.

-There’s a reason why MS Edge exists as a browser.

-“Holy shit I have to learn all these new softwares/ programs”🥲

-“I don’t want to be analyst anymore, I’m going to try and pivot to consulting” 🥲🥲

My brother helped me get my pain meds and got me some food as well and dropped me off at home where I instantly knocked out after taking my meds. Overall not a bad experience!&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I just needed a space to write this out and talk about it. Hopefully that's ok. I am in another country, interning at a camp for the summer. The group of interns here have all become like a little family over the summer. There's this girl who is also interning who caught my eye. She's so sweet and funny and always makes me laugh. She even said that I'm good looking at one point. We both have a lot of similar interests and are passionate about a lot of the same things. She's also a spontaneous adventurer like me and i have done a few fun things with her and usually one or two other interns. We all went stargazing tonight and we both decided to go venture off across a field on our own away from the group. We did, and went for a walk and hopped some fences and eventually made our way back to the group after seeing the moon (we went where trees were not blocking it.) I really like her and she's so sweet. We were in the car one time with the other interns at camp and I fell asleep and later woke up with my head on her shoulder and she didn't mind. I really want to hold her hand tbh. I don't know if she likes me or just likes me as a person like everyone else.

There&amp;#39;s this girl who is also interning who caught my eye. She&amp;#39;s so sweet and funny and always makes me laugh. She even said that I&amp;#39;m good looking at one point.

We all went stargazing tonight and we both decided to go venture off across a field on our own away from the group. We did, and went for a walk and hopped some fences and eventually made our way back to the group after seeing the moon (we went where trees were not blocking it.) I really like her and she&amp;#39;s so sweet. We were in the car one time with the other interns at camp and I fell asleep and later woke up with my head on her shoulder and she didn&amp;#39;t mind.

,CasualConversation,"Since early 2020, I've been wanting to enter into a coding boot camp called Lambda School(now Bloom Insititute of Technology) to change into a new lifelong career in Tech. I was paying off my debts, and saving up money to move to a new city(Denver), where I would work part-time and be in a boot camp. Then covid hit. I had to slow down work because I was living with my parents at the time, and limit my exposure to the public(my job was a grocery delivery driver). This slowed down my savings and delayed my move(Denver was a hot spot for covid), but I was still adamant to start the boot camp. Then I got diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in June. I had to completely stop working. 

Changed my life completely, but I didn't let it stop me. After getting on a treatment plan, and showing signs of progress, I finally enrolled in Lambda school in September(2020).

Unfortunately, I learned that my first medication wasn't working 2 months in, and there was a high probability that my CML was accelerating 2 months after that, so I had to drop out, for both the possibility of a Bone Marrow Transplant(which has a year-long recovery period) and my mental health. I was devasted mentally for 2 months. In my head I was planning my goodbyes, I picked out a song to play at my possible funeral.

 After further testing, I didn't need a BMT after all. I was making progress with a new medication, leaps, and bounds of progress. It took me a while to recover mentally, but when I felt I was finally ready, I re-enrolled in October(2021). Busted my ass for 6 months, pinched every penny, and graduated from the program in May. 

Then I hustled for months trying to get into a new job. I sent hundreds of applications and had dozens of interviews with rejection after rejection. I worked as much as a could as a grocery delivery driver to pay my bills(which happened to change how they paid, so I made half as much as I did before).

,CasualConversation,"For anyone who wasn't around at the time, people used to make and share all kinds of crazy-ass, custom themes for their PCs. I was only aware of exactly how the process worked on Windows 98/XP, but I understand that MacOS and Linux operating systems from that era had similar support for themes.

Now, you might not even know what I mean by ""themes."" They were files you could download (or make yourself) that changed **all kinds of stuff** on your PC. 

It'd start with the colors of all your window elements, right down to different shades for the edges of the windows, the color of the taskbar, the background of the windows, the color of the scrollbar, the color of the *background* of the scrollbar, all the different text colors (and fonts) and every other little thing that could be colored.

And then you got into every single different thing your mouse can do. Custom mouse cursors for the regular pointer, the busy pointer, the text-insert cursor, the little arrows for when you're resizing a window. They could be all types of shit. Often they were **insanely** gaudy and ugly.

And then you get into the custom sounds. **Everything** that made a noise would be changed. And, just like the mouse cursors, that shit was also usually pretty stupid and impractical. Like, you'd have a little ""ding"" sound in the standard sound set, but it'd be a whole-ass line from a movie, in your custom theme.

And, of course, everything would be themed around the centerpiece of the desktop background.

But it didn't even end there, because 98 and XP allowed you to customize each folder with a background image. So your ""My Documents"" folder could have its own background, which was applied by the theme.

So, like, if you had a Lamborghini theme, there might be a picture of a Diablo on the desktop background, but then a Countach on the My Documents folder. And so on.

I remember I used this one for a LONG time that was dragon theme. Some kind of Badass Dark Fantasy^TM digital painting of a black dragon on the desktop, a weird muted-brown-and-black color scheme, and a mouse pointer that looked like a dragon...and that bitch would start *flapping its wings* instead of the hourglass loading icon. And when you resized shit, the dragon would be, like, gripping the edge of the window with its claws.

And the sounds were just cringe, now that I remember it. All kinds of wack-ass dragon roars. But the best part was the sound it would play when Windows started up from being shut down. 

**For some dumbass reason, it was just an incredibly loud thunderclap sound.**

Every time I was away from my computer for several days and plugged that shit back in, it would startle me to the point that I almost chipped a tooth from involuntarily jumping in my chair.

Shit...maybe I just explained why that shit all went away. Because it was objectively lame.

***BUT IT WAS SUBJECTIVELY FUCKING DOPE AS FUCKING FUCK, Y'ALL.***

Who else remembers using crazy-ass themes? And why do you think everyone just stopped wanting to use them, to the point that nobody even complained when OS makers stopped supporting them?

I actually think Linux mofos can still use all that crazy shit. But I ain't got the energy to fuck with Linux. I mean, I've had a Linux install before, but I've never gotten that far into it.

But y'all discuss all this.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 Cent - Get Rich or Die Tryin. I wasn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of 50 Cent. I liked him in features but preferred other hiphop of the time like Outkast and Mobb Deep. But this album was huge when it dropped. Most people in my school had it. 50 Cent dominated the 00&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP. Again, unavoidable. It was heard everywhere. &amp;quot;Stan&amp;quot; especially makes me think back to the 00&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Title sounds funny but I just legitimately choked for the first time in my life ... and it was absolutely horrifying. For a brief second I thought it was over for me. I will do my best to describe the past few minutes of what just happened to me. 

I was sitting down at my computer eating some french fries and I decided to take a drink of water while I was still eating the fries. I figured I would just wash the fries down with some water, but it ended up expanding in my throat. It took a few seconds to realize it but I couldn't breathe. I tried my best to take a breath and at most I could get like a little squeak of air and that was it. It took about 15 seconds until the panic started to deeply set it and I was absolutely freaking out. The very first thing I did was call my girlfriend (I am completely alone in my apartment choking and it just seemed right to call her so atleast someone knows what happened to me if the worst case scenario were to happen). I set the phone on speaker while it's ringing and I'm frantically running around my apartment trying to figure out how I can breathe again. I tried punching my gut a couple times while dramatically exhaling but nothing was happening. 

I'm about a minute and a half into choking at this point and I'm completely freaking out. My girlfriend didn't answer the phone and I'm (first the first time in my life) considering that I might just die right here alone in my apartment on my bathroom floor. I start to actually feel this real dread about this is how it all ends for me....choked on some goddamn french fries. I have a momment where I'm just standing there doing nothing, considering the fact that I can't even take a breath and also considering that I have about 2 minutes at most left until I pass out. One last time I punch my gut while bent over and basically try and force myself to throw up this food I'm choking on. In what seemed like my last valiant effort to live, miraculously the food got unstuck from my throat and I could breath again. The feeling of relief was like no other. I could cry now just thinking about how relived I was to stop choking. The feeling of not being about to breath is the scariest thing I've ever experienced. At one momment I thought I was done for

Just needed to share my experience here because I never ever thought I'd be someone who would choke on food. It always sounded so silly to me. But here I am, almost died over some french fries and water. Chew your food fully people. Fin.

*Edit: Wow I didn't expect my to blow up like this! Thank you everyone for the friendly advice on teaching myself self-heimlich and buying life saving choking device for emergencies. It's fun to read all your stories (not like it's fun to read about people choking, but it's fun to be able to relate to you guys!) I now feel like I'm part of some exclusive choking community (.... wait ... don't take that out of context lol) ... anyway you guys are so awesome for taking the time to share your stories. Life is fleeting, one momment you can be here and everything is seemingly normal and the next you can be wiped out of existence from choking on a few fries.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about a minute and a half into choking at this point and I&amp;#39;m completely freaking out. My girlfriend didn&amp;#39;t answer the phone and I&amp;#39;m (first the first time in my life) considering that I might just die right here alone in my apartment on my bathroom floor. I start to actually feel this real dread about this is how it all ends for me....choked on some goddamn french fries. I have a momment where I&amp;#39;m just standing there doing nothing, considering the fact that I can&amp;#39;t even take a breath and also considering that I have about 2 minutes at most left until I pass out. One last time I punch my gut while bent over and basically try and force myself to throw up this food I&amp;#39;m choking on. In what seemed like my last valiant effort to live, miraculously the food got unstuck from my throat and I could breath again. The feeling of relief was like no other. I could cry now just thinking about how relived I was to stop choking. The feeling of not being about to breath is the scariest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced. At one momment I thought I was done for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just needed to share my experience here because I never ever thought I&amp;#39;d be someone who would choke on food. It always sounded so silly to me. But here I am, almost died over some french fries and water. Chew your food fully people. Fin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: Wow I didn&amp;#39;t expect my to blow up like this! Thank you everyone for the friendly advice on teaching myself self-heimlich and buying life saving choking device for emergencies. It&amp;#39;s fun to read all your stories (not like it&amp;#39;s fun to read about people choking, but it&amp;#39;s fun to be able to relate to you guys!) I now feel like I&amp;#39;m part of some exclusive choking community (.... wait ... don&amp;#39;t take that out of context lol) ... anyway you guys are so awesome for taking the time to share your stories. Life is fleeting, one momment you can be here and everything is seemingly normal and the next you can be wiped out of existence from choking on a few fries. I&amp;#39;m going to spend today full of gratitude and walk with purpose because I genuinely feel grateful to still be alive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And before he is released back unto the world, a shadow of his once towering dreadful greatness, he is given a new name, one that shall forever shame him. What is his new name?&lt;/p&gt;

For context, I’m 19 and I completed two years of Uni in May, with two more to go. I worked a side job for most of my time there, bought a bunch of gaming stuff I could only dream of in high school, made friends, drank a bunch and smoked a shit ton of vapes and cigarettes.

It’s a singular, small little gnat, not multiple. I have no idea where it came from. I keep my room clean and don’t bring any food in my room so I have no idea where it came from. The only idea where I think it could come from is a possible animal dying inside my wall. About 6 months ago I got this deathly smell lingering across my entire room, i can’t quite explain it but it smelled like shit and death combined and I could never find the source.

,CasualConversation,"the princess diaries :( i remember when this movie came out. i was around 10 years old and heavily feminine. anything girly, pink, princess, just everything and all things female, i was livingggg for it… im still a very feminine woman haha.

when this movie came out, a group of my friends got together and asked to watch it in theatres. i think kaitlyns mom took me, her, and 3 other girls. it was such a cool day. the girls came to my house after school. we ate snacks and kaitlyns mom came over to drive us to the movies. the whole time my eyes were glued to the screen. i loved this movie. 

anyways, i am now 31f and recently decided that i like to chill out listening to movie soundtracks (may i suggest drive!!!!! so good.) i have a playlist on my spotify with songs that remind me of my late grandmother. they are instrumentals and they make me cry so much thinking about her. 2 of the songs are from pocahontas (there is a scene in that movie of pocahontas sitting with grandmother willow telling her about a dream she keeps having. the songs in that scene really get to me because i have fond memories of myself sitting with my grandmother under our family’s pear tree (i also got married under that same tree.) i also kind of resemble her and have the same close bond with my grandma… anyways…) i guess my spotify skipped to songs like the songs i was just talking about… it was the theme/opening to the princess diaries. 

now im listening to the soundtrack and im crying!!!!!! its a good one!! i could see myself cooking to this… my next soundtrack will be from one of my favourite movies… SPANGLISH.

,CasualConversation,"EKIY D7 Android Head-unit first impression

Some weeks ago I decided to order an Android head-unit for mine Suzuki Celerio: I didn't wanna spend much, so opted for a unit with an older chipset. Yes I know they are outdated....

It came with an 9 inch 720P screen, 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage. Reverse camera was also included. Also it included a cable, to connect the original USB port of the car. But that one somehow doesn't work with mine USB-C phone, not sure if it's related to the phone or the USB port is simply an older type and it won't work with newer device's? Haven't tested this, because I simply used the other USB connection.

The device works fine, it's not super fast. But still not super slow: loading Google Maps takes a bit, but I don't see the issue. What I do see as an issue conserving the seller: they claim it runs on Android 10, but I did the Fake Device Test and it runs Android 8. So I already opened a dispute for that...

,CasualConversation,"So basically, my friends and I have a minecraft server. We share everything, that's kind of the point. Recently however, I'm detecting change. 

1. At first, everything was supposed to be shared. So basically, if you got emeralds for trading, doesn't matter if your saving, straight to the communal chest for everyone to use. This didn't last, and now we store needs in our inventory and excess goes to the communal chest.

2. One of our members seems a bit more nutty in the server, and bored with it in general. They're less likely to join than before, and overall are less enthusiastic about it. On the flipside, we might have another member soon.


So I'm looking at this and I think a chance at a more individualistic server is likely, and maayyybbeeee some conflict????

So I have a master plan. I've hid some valuable stuff (that I got myself) and am hoping in a jam I can use it to give myself leverage if things go south.

On the other hand, I could totally be over thinking this and may cause the downfall myself because I will just tug enough at the strings little by little to undo the entire knot.

And if it helps anyone here have a place to casually feel safe to discuss their own upcoming or past marriages, awesome! Ok. Commencing gush now.

Man. Wow. After two years of engagement, after 4.5 years together, it finally happened. I got married! And to the absolute love of my life and perfect woman for me! Everything was really stressful as everyone says, but as soon as that ceremony ended I felt so much better. My (now) wife looked absolutely stunning. I cried several times, which is a big deal as the self-defined Rock (no relation) of the relationship. It was, for lack of a better word, amazing.

The reception was a whirlwind but we had so much fun. The photographer teased me cuz I was smiling so much in all my photos that it looked like it was posing. I was just that fucking happy.

And man, the amount of serene peace we both have together...it's indescribable. I'm just laying in bed with her as she gets some extra sleep before our Roadtrip Honeymoon, and I can't stop staring at her and thinking how much I love here haha

I know it's all honeymoon phase crap, but it just feels right. If anything, I hope this marriage bliss lasts much longer than the usual amount.

Truth is, even though my acne went away, the insecure teenager in me stayed. I haven’t completely let go of my insecurities even if my skin is now clear. I always worry about how certain lighting might be making me look oily, rough-skinned, and old.

,CasualConversation,"I spent a good portion of my early 20s in Asia, mostly Japan. I moved back to my home country (US) and I just feel off center. I've been back for over two years at this point. It feels weird to miss a country and culture that aren't my own. Especially since compared to actual natives, I'm still very much a rube lol. But it's also weird because I learned how to ""be"" an adult in a different culture. When I was younger, I felt like a high schooler pretending to be an adult, but by the time I left, I actually felt like one. My parents left their country to move to the US, so I guess they understand that feeling, but there are tons of people from there culture here. They have a network.

I have a few friends from those days that I can talk to, but we're spread out/haven't seen each other in person since living there. I missed some major events in the US but was there for events in Japan. I spent my time having fun in ways I don't think I would in the US just because it was generally (though not completely safe) for me to get around in groups or alone. So I've had to restructure a few things. I once lost the key to my apartment and just left the door unlocked 24/7 until I had to go on a month long vacation (the keys are expensive!) and sometimes in the morning if it was really cold, I'd leave my car on with my purse inside. There's always a chance for crime, but, y'know. I'd never do that in the US though lol.

# Does this place exist?

I don't know exactly what im looking for, meaning, precisely in detail, but i have an idea. I'd love to live in a secluded, lush area from the majority of society, but still be close enough for convenience. So maybe like a log cabin community up on some hills or a hidden beach town, that is a 15 to 30 min drive to town or city with basic amenities.

I don't want it to be alone, and have neighbors but far away where you still have a sense of freedom and privacy.

What I'm describing sounds really expensive, so i got to throw this in there, I need it to be quite budget-friendly. Something a 30-year single male who makes 35k a year can afford. I'm assuming this would be out of the states at this point, i was thinking, someplace like this has to exist in Mexico, or maybe even further down.

Btw, I'm currently living in Orange County, CA... so if it is like Mexico and close, i can even commute back often.

,CasualConversation,"It's really silly and unimportant; none of my friends care, but I want to talk about it lol :) 

I've been wanting to switch over to Linux full-time since I first tried Ubuntu around 14 years ago. I had made a live boot disk in order to circumvent some parental controls that my step-dad had installed on my desktop. I hated the look of Ubuntu back then, but everything else about it was great; even on the live disk, it seemed to run better than XP on my weak hardware? 

Through years of school and technical jobs and everything I always remained a Windows guy. And like I felt really bad about not using Linux but for some reason I felt too timid to actually swap over. I guess I was worried that I'd lose a bunch of data and have to change all my applications and stuff. Then, about a week ago I committed to switching to Kubuntu full-time, like cold turkey. I realized that most of my data is stored on cloud services and stuff, and most of my applications are cross-platform, so reinstalling the OS is actually no big deal at all. So I just did it. 

There were a few scary hiccups and I also made some embarrassingly stupid mistakes in the process. But I got everything ironed out and I can already tell it was totally worth it. There are so many reasons why I feel like Kubuntu is the way to go: Bash is powerful and convenient; the filesystem is tidier; it's more secure; managing software is easier; you don't have to pay for it; the list goes on. 

KDE Plasma is insanely customizable. You can have any image, video, or even shader as a background. I had an animated PS3 background with 3 simultaneous taskbars and a Wikipedia widget with a 45 degree tilt? The flexibility is bonkers. You can set it to make windows translucent by mousewheeling over them. You can configure the system clock to tell you to go fuck yourself. You can have Numa Numa playing upside-down on a permanent loop in a desktop widget (not a window). Just normal Plasma out of the box without installing anything weird or doing anything hacky. 

I really wish I had been a part of the Ubuntu community sooner; I should've switched way back when I was a kid. I would've had so much Linux experience and knowledge by now, and I might have contributed some cool stuff. I can see this underlying philosophy that's underpinned and defined a lot of Linux development. But at the same time, I guess making the transition was probably a lot harder back then. It's just that now is a great time to switch to Linux. Like, with Steam Proton, I can still play all the same games that I was playing on Windows. That wasn't really the case back in the day.

,CasualConversation,"This happened about 10 years ago when I was a street photographer as a hobby and I clearly remember this story like it happened yesterday. I used to go around my city and just shoot everywhere for fun. But one night I came across a homeless person. Now usually, I never give cash to them for obvious reasons but if they specifically ask for food, I dont mind helping. At that moment I had a Banh mi, which is a Vietnamese style sandwich that I grew up eating. I only wanted to bring it home with me but since he was there, I just gave it to him and we part ways. 

I didn't think of that situation at all but I came back to that same area browsing around with my camera and the same exact guy ran up to me and happily said, ""hey you! I remember you! You gave me a sandwich like a while ago!"". It took me a while because that was actually 2 months ago. I couldn't believe he remembered me. I was shocked and asked how he remembered and he mentioned my camera. He eagerly asked me where I got the sandwich because he said it was legit the best sandwich he ever had. So I walked him there and had a little conversation about random things. We ended up talking for 20 minutes or so. 

As we approached to the sandwich shop, I asked if he wants me to buy one for him but he declined and said, ""no thanks! I had nice people spare me enough money today"". I was caught off guard. He could of saved that money but declined me. It made me thought if he was even homeless in the first place. But it happened so fast that I didn't even have a chance to process. As I walked away it definitely tripped me out but that really made me happy for some reason. 

To this day when I walk around the area or even eating the sandwich itself, I think about that gentleman. I haven't seen him in the streets since and I go around the area every few weeks.

,CasualConversation,"My 20s felt like I was chasing a dream. Getting married, trying to get settled, securing jobs, raising kids etc etc. Often exhausted, stressed, and actually felt unsettled with very little time to spare. Socially I felt like I needed to really blend in with others. Ironically I had little motivation to do anything other than work, sleep, and repeat (and raising babies). Physically I've always been a skinny guy. Mentally I didn't think I was fun or attractive to be around (happily married but when I said attractive, I mean I'm not someone people usually come up and talk to in casual conversations)

My early 30s I realized I'm my own person and a sudden rush of motivation and drive existed that I never felt before. I ended up quitting a good paying job that was both stressful and draining. I started my own business and thought I should've done this sooner!! Now I actually make more money, with less stress, and could do something I dreamed about doing happily with a great team. 

Now my upper 30s, I finally started working out because I'm way more motivated to do stuff and actually make time. Important point here: I felt the drive before I had more time.  

Physically, my body is more toned (I think) and I feel good about myself. I carry myself differently and even my posture changed.

,CasualConversation,"Let me start by saying I don't really use streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I prefer buying movies on either VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray, or from the iTunes Store. And if you want my reasons, you can check out [this old post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ns9311/movietv_streaming_services_are_bs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). But lately I got to thinking: are we on the verge of an industry collapse?

Just think back to the video game crash of 1983 and the dot com crash of 2000. Video games and the Internet were insanely popular during the early 80's and late 90's respectively, and this naturally led to everyone investing and trying to get a piece of the pie until it ended up collapsing in on itself. Those two crashes happened due to different factors, but one key element in both instances was over-saturation. And now, there's so many different streaming services to choose from that you don't know which way to look. And Netflix - the biggest of the bunch - is starting to decline with multiple show cancellations and losing subscribers at an alarming rate. This could just be bad business decisions on their part, but a part of me wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a similar effect on other services in maybe a year or two. I'm sure streaming will survive just like video games and Internet, and it'll learn from it's mistakes and adapt (maybe going to just having two or three major services). Then again, I could be wrong. I'm no expert on finance, marketing, or streaming, so I'm just being theoretical.

,CasualConversation,"I've always been passionate about writing my ideas and thoughts on paper (or more likely computer) and I also try to write diary regularly but I guess I still haven't realized how useful writing can be for mental clarity and well being.

Last week was extremely burdensome for me because of so much big changes going on in my life. I was all the time stressed and anxious but the worst thing was that I couldn't even pinpoint the reason for it.

At first I didn't feel like writing because I thought ""what is that going to accomplish? I'd be just ruminating even more with my worries"" but I'm glad I did.

First of all I simply started to write down all my worries and I instantly noticed how it helped me to step away from my worries and see more clearly what is going on. Secondly I started to naturally arrange my thoughts and problems in a better way. 

It was relieving to be able to name the feelings and write down the reasons behind them. Eventually I felt like I understood myself better and the stress and anxiety faded away.

I did this pretty much all the way through the weekend and I am just amazed how much better I feel. I feel like I can concentrate on things I enjoy and my vague anxiety is pretty much gone.

I really hope this post helps someone else to relieve their stress after trying this out. Lastly I want to give you few tips to make most of your writing sessions:

1. Write down your worry/thought or some idea related to that immediately after it occurs
2. Take a look at your thought from different perspectives: reasons behind it, what it causes you to do, how could you solve the problem, is it really that big of a deal or important? etc.
3. Try to arrange your thoughts and see how they connect to each other (this helped me a lot!). This works even better if you can visually arrange your text.
4. Make a plan. It could be that you come to conclusion that your worry was insignificant or maybe you decide to change something in your actions.

When i was around 18 years old, i went to a pub with a few of my friends. My old childhood best-friend was there too. I was going through a phase were I had my hair bleached blonde and cut short, with an eyebrow piercing. 

And when my best-friend saw me she looked me up and down and said “WHY!!”. At the time i thought she was being mean to me, especially because she always has opinions about me and my other best friend, and kind of gave show off vibes that she is better than everyone. 

That is how i took it at the time, and for some reason my reaction, and here it comes!, was to pass by this other friend of ours and sort of like rub against him while passing, and then i looked at her. I have no idea what that meant. She gave me a really disgusted look after that. And I have hated this memory ever since. 

She removed me from social media and never spoke to me again. I sometimes feel like I’m a terrible person for doing something like that. And when i remember this memory, it really brings me down.

Wow, shit I'm a fucking weeb lmao

Perhaps my favorite anime (with one exception) is To Your Eternity, but specifically episodes 1 up to 12. I cried like a BITCH binging this show in two days. I think I cried like three times in episode 12 on three separate parts. 

Once, when Gugu was going to leave his family and house for Rean's birthday party because it was such a sweet frame of time (and then the grandpa teared up which then just made me actually cry because he gets it 😭).

Another when Gugu and Rean were recalling memories and one line made Rean's hand twitch (I'm not sure why I cried during this but I did 😭 because this show gets it). And another when Gugu hugged his family near the end of the episode (I actually watched the show twice with a friend and I cried AGAIN when this scene pulled up LMAO 😭😭).

Hopefully I hadn't spoiled anything crucial.

Out of all the shows I've seen, To Your Eternity is my most loved because no other show had ever made me so emotional and feel so much watching an anime. My most favorite animes (or things in general) are those that could invoke a strong and unique sensation in me for the duration of the show, persisting even afterwards. With Vivy, it's the phenomenal cinematography, cool Sci-Fi setting and cutting edge story telling. With Dr. STONE, well it's something I have to elaborate on tomorrow and give some time and energy to.

I've a lot more I can say that I can add later on or have a conversation with someone for but I'll leave it for tomorrow.

,CasualConversation,"Title. Not a specific song, but as a whole ""album"", which video games do you think have the best soundtrack? Or perhaps not best, because that suggests objectivity.

So rather, what's your favorite, say, top 5? Bonus points if it's something underappreciated or less well-known or talked about. You can also include a whole entire series (such as Mario) if you enjoy all those soundtracks, or if you can't decide a particular entry from that series.

Mine:

1.) Metroid. The music in those games is really something special, the atmosphere is unparalleled and feels literally alive at times. This goes for many of the older games like Metroid Prime, which makes it even more impressive for the time, where video game music was less popular.

2.) Portal. I recently discovered the soundtrack on Spotify and gave it a listen, and pretty much all the songs are bops. Fast paced. They got beeps, they got boops. I feel like a collab between ""Aperture Science Psychoacoustic Laboratories"" (even the name is great lol) and Daft Punk would have been legendary.

3.) Hades. A fairly new game, but highly successful. Surprisingly though, I never even *heard* of this game before, instead I discovered it through the soundtrack that I stumbled upon on Spotify. Best way I can describe it, is more like an acoustical version of Doom. Matches the fast paced Greek mythological setting really well. It made me want to play the game, which I eventually bought and thoroughly enjoyed.

4.) Minecraft. I feel that most the music, especially the older tracks composed by C418 originally, are very underappreciated. Although I don't want to call out individual songs much here, ""Alpha"" is ten minutes long and thusly I think doesn't get much attention because it only plays during credits, which most people probably skip. But anyways, I believe the music perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being in a dream.

5.) Halo 3 ODST. While I love all the Halo soundtracks, Halo 3 ODST went for a jazzy vibe, I used to study to the ""rain"" song on repeat, otherwise known as deference for darkness. But, it also has some really upbeat songs in there for the day missions. The game in general has a far different atmosphere because you're a human rather than a Spartan, and there's a mix of calming/lonely night gameplay, and more epic day missions.

I'm feeling a mixture of suprise, confusion, tension, worry and a number of other things. Have I been disconnected from my surroundings? What has been happening around me? Am I a good friend, or even a friend?

I don't feel betrayed, just guilt I guess. For not being aware, and probably distant. Seeing how others have changed socially these past few years, compared to me. It makes me worried.

Growing up , my life was kind of harder with her because with her disability, she was not always able to understand some of the deeper meanings behind the things I needed as a child.

,CasualConversation,"This happened today for context where I live there is essentially one road to get to and from work home etc. One to go in to town and one out. So I'm heading out of town in my moms cars solo whens she's in the car she's very cautious or nervous I would say even if I already have my license and everything. I was following behind this car going around 90 km/h, this is fast in her books, and I would lean on the  other side of the road to see if it was clear or bit cause I really wanted to overtake a car for the first time. After a while I get the chance and I go for it, just as I'm in the other lane I see a car coming so what do I do, I speed up, I'm going around 130 ish I think.

Liberal/left friends have turned ultra conservative. Meanwhile, hardcore conservative friends have become extremely open minded. 

My family members have grown more divided and distant. My once cheerful cousins and family have been beaten down as they enter the workforce. 

But overall I’ve noticed that people are much more hostile towards society.

,CasualConversation,"so, basically I'm **super clumsy lol**. I was returning from my university with all of my classmates record notes after getting them signed, and since I was walking by myself, I was wearing my headphones on and they were on full volume. I saw my classmate in a distance and I was relieved that I could ask him to drop me off in front of my home or walk me home sharing the stack of notebooks. So in a hurry I went straight to him and started venting out at him about the professors and I was telling him that I would be really grateful if he helps me carry these books and I literally didn't let him talk until I heard, *""Excuse me, I would love to help but do I know you?""* I turned to give him a slap on his back for making fun of me buttttttt to my actual realization I was talking to a complete stranger. Then I came to know that I messed up by not wearing my spectacles or my lens and due to my low sense of sight I was embarrassing myself by mistaking him for my friend from a long distance and was  blabbering to a completely random stranger who kinda looked like him and not even knowing it until then. But luckily the guy turned out to be a good guy and walked me home carrying all of the books and since we talked while we walked home, I later found out that we go to the same university.

I was returning from my university with all of my classmates record notes after getting them signed, and since I was walking by myself, I was wearing my headphones on and they were on full volume. I saw my classmate in a distance and I was relieved that I could ask him to drop me off in front of my home or walk me home sharing the stack of notebooks. So in a hurry I went straight to him and started venting out at him about the professors and I was telling him that I would be really grateful if he helps me carry these books and I literally didn&amp;#39;t let him talk until I heard, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Excuse me, I would love to help but do I know you?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I turned to give him a slap on his back for making fun of me buttttttt to my actual realization I was talking to a complete stranger. Then I came to know that I messed up by not wearing my spectacles or my lens and due to my low sense of sight I was embarrassing myself by mistaking him for my friend from a long distance and was  blabbering to a completely random stranger who kinda looked like him and not even knowing it until then. But luckily the guy turned out to be a good guy and walked me home carrying all of the books and since we talked while we walked home, I later found out that we go to the same university. He was very sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"My grandpa used to play baseball all the time. When I was younger, he taught me a little trick to catching. It might seem obvious, but I've found that whenever I think of it before catching something it makes it a lot easier. The trick is simply ""Never take your eye off the ball."" If I remember this before someone throws something to me, it helps me laser focus on the object without blinking or flinching. In turn my chances of catching are much higher. Like I said, it may be obvious and I'm just dumb lol.

So onto my question, are there any tips like this that could help with accuracy when you are throwing something?

I don't quite get the appeal to the followers. Why are these checking someone changing outfits or taking a selfie or whatever?

&lt;p&gt;Are celebrities followers mostly teens?&lt;br/&gt;
I think when I was in teenage years there seemed to be more people following the celebs. The people were sometimes sexually attracted to the celebs, or wanted to live their lifestyle, or were really into some hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays I check the IG, Justin Bieber, Kylie Jenner for example, they are just posting some selfies or simple photos, then there are millions of likes every photo. I don&amp;#39;t quite get the appeal to the followers. Why are these checking someone changing outfits or taking a selfie or whatever? I imaging such followers mostly to be young people who are not very self centered and not very self assured?&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday I posted here that I would walk a marathon today. I have never trained for a marathon and I usually run about 3 miles a couple times per week. I’m a bigger girl so by no means am I fit. But I am much better at endurance than speed. So I was pretty slow, averaging about 3 miles per hour. But that includes some breaks to buy food and to charge my phone. So probably closer to 3.15 miles per hour or a bit more. I tracked it with Strava which ended up being about a mile ahead of my iPhone health app, so I decided to walk the extra mile just to be sure. 

The first few miles were pretty good, around mile 20 I had to stop to charge my phone as well as put a bandaid on a blister. And around 24 I notices a rash on my legs. I think it’s a heat rash cuz it was 102 f all day. Anyways I’m all showered now, and I’m pretty sore. The part that got sore first were my hips. But overall I’d say it’s pretty doable!

,CasualConversation,"Pretty much title. I got my schedule for the next few weeks, and the week after next I'm only working 1 day. Meaning I have 6 days off in a row.

Things to note: I work retail, filling online orders for a big chain hardware store. The job sucks, but the people are nice. I also don't need the extra money, because my expenses are super low. Finally, im planning on quitting in the next 3 months, because I'm about to graduate college.

Pros of having time off: a break from work, time to focus on school or other interests, and get things done around the house.

Cons of having time off: smaller check. Also boredom since work is the only place I go to.

My Question is for those that use automatic dishwashers the machines not your kids or spouse to wash dishes LOL.  I put my silverware in the basket with the handle side down so the ends of the utensils that are the most dirty are facing up and get cleaned good.  Some of friends think that is crazy.  They asked how I take the utensils out. I say I grab that end out sticking up out of the basket. They are like so you contaminate the part that touches your food as soon as you take it out. I said I guess so?   Just curious what my friends here think.  Thanks
