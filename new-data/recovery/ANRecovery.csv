The next weekend I ate the same amount as the previous weekend, once again i faced pitting edema for the next few days. It finally went away, now its a new week and I am experiencing it again.

as a person who was underweight before my illness, i find it so frustrating, that i may have to get to a ,,normal” weight.. it honestly crushes me down. it shouldn’t, but it does.

because of that.. even though i was underweight, aaalmost a healthy weight! (maybe i did gain to that point - i don’t know, it was hard to tell) but of course. i relapsed.

i need to stop.. but i don’t have therapy.. and everybody tells me i look fine. my weight is not healthy at all.. it’s not at a point, where i would end up in a hospital, but it’s minimal.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will my metabolism completely go back to normal or is there a chance that I messed up my metabolism forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will I get back to my pre-ED weight ? Before I got anorexia Nervosa I was overweight , so probably this was not my set point. Is my set point going to be higher than before ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What helped you to accept weight gain ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if my therapist aren&amp;#39;t able to help me , can I recovery simply by wanting it and keep eating ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be so grateful for some answers&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Could anyone offer advice on what to say/how to support my cousin with an ED? Is there anything you wish someone had said to help or get through to you?

Background: We are in our early 20s. She’s suffered with OCD and ED traits for much of her life. It’s gone up and down. For the past year-ish things have really gone down hill. I won’t be graphic so as not to trigger, but her physical symptoms are very evident, she exercises compulsively, and isn’t herself (irritable, sensitive). Her mom and our aunts have tried to intervene, but to no avail yet. I don’t live in the area, but I see her at holidays and our families are close.

I currently have a long text saved illustrating my own mental health struggles (which maybe she’ll find relatable and not so condescending/judgmental), that I’m scared for her, and that I’m proud of her for trying and that I love her. I’m wondering if there are specific things I should/shouldn’t say. My current text does not mention eating or exercise, just being happy. I figured that might make her less defensive.

I’ve heard from family members that lately she’s said things like, “I know I should eat more, I want to get help.” So she’s at least rationally somewhat aware. But I know it goes beyond rational thought and isn’t that simple. I feel compelled to say something because I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t, but I’m not sure what. I don’t want to trigger or alienate her (although obviously I’m happy to have her upset with me if I thought it would spur her to get better).

Maybe I shouldn’t be so detailed in my message and should just be like, “thinking of you!” And that kind of thing? Resources online are really vague, like, “use I statements, be supportive”.

I won’t be graphic so as not to trigger, but her physical symptoms are very evident, she exercises compulsively, and isn’t herself (irritable, sensitive). Her mom and our aunts have tried to intervene, but to no avail yet. I don’t live in the area, but I see her at holidays and our families are close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have a long text saved illustrating my own mental health struggles (which maybe she’ll find relatable and not so condescending/judgmental), that I’m scared for her, and that I’m proud of her for trying and that I love her. I’m wondering if there are specific things I should/shouldn’t say. My current text does not mention eating or exercise, just being happy. I figured that might make her less defensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard from family members that lately she’s said things like, “I know I should eat more, I want to get help.” So she’s at least rationally somewhat aware. But I know it goes beyond rational thought and isn’t that simple. I feel compelled to say something because I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t, but I’m not sure what. I don’t want to trigger or alienate her (although obviously I’m happy to have her upset with me if I thought it would spur her to get better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I shouldn’t be so detailed in my message and should just be like, “thinking of you!” And that kind of thing? Resources online are really vague, like, “use I statements, be supportive”. Any concrete examples would be really helpful. Thank you, and I hope everyone who reads this and your loved ones are happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"This is going to be long, and I only felt the need to post this because when I first started my recovery, inpatient wasn't an option and I had no access to medical help. Everything felt hopeless, I was disabled due to being underweight, I barely even knew any of the real medical aspects of recovery, and no one could give me any worthwhile weight gain tips. So here's some of the biggest things that helped me, and I hope they can help someone in a similar situation. Obviously, these are just things that helped me in a tight spot and medical guidance is extremely highly recommended if possible. 

The most important thing was to intake as many calories as possible, no matter what it was. Being on a super tight budget, fast food, LOTS of peanut butter, eggs, and granola bars were my best friends. The thing that made the biggest difference at first was having many small snacks readily available throughout the day. Eat everything you can get your hands on, eat everything that makes you feel good. Guilty pleasures aren't real. I had a hard time gathering an appetite for anything, but I found that even a couple bites of something light (ex. watermelon, cucumber, crackers, etc) helped with that. When I felt like I couldn't even down that, water with MIO or lemon/lime did the trick. 

The next thing was forcing food down, no matter what. I learned it Will hurt at first, but it must be done (look into refeeding guidelines, however, because in certain situations it can be dangerous) Your stomach does shrink over time, and it has to be retrained to intake a normal amount of food, as I'm sure a lot of people in this situation know already. All I can say is keep pushing. It is worth it. 

On a more emotional level, I found it was actually very helpful for me to completely get off of social media and stop taking pictures of myself for the time being. Things like Instagram and Twitter where I was constantly bombarded with pretty, ""perfectly"" figured girls only made things more miserable. 

As for specific foods, I found you CANNOT have ANY sort of diet restrictions. (Save for medically necessary of course)  Meat, dairy, etc CANNOT be off limits if not needed. Dairy in particular was a Huge part of my recovery. 
Protein shakes helped a bit, but I personally found that creatine supplements helped even more. 
I hate Nestle as much as the next person, but their benecalorie supplements helped So much on days where I felt I couldn't get enough calories in. Cook it in pancakes, put it in your cereal milk, mix it in a smoothie/milkshake, etc. Clifbars, Lil Debbie's nutter butters, and pasta were my next best friends. Like I said, guilty pleasures aren't real. Get whatever has the most calories.

 However, long-term restrictions in diet inevitably lead to vitamin deficiency. If possible, get blood work done at the least to see what's needed. Do eat fruit/veggies between higher calorie foods to make sure you're getting what you need. Take a multivitamin every day, soak up some sun when possible, and absolutely do NOT feel guilt for sitting around doing absolutely nothing. That's more calories you get to keep, and they're your absolute best friend during this. Every calorie counts. 
It's a long, shitty road with lots of bumps, and that's okay. Because it will make a difference, you will feel more like yourself, and if you're like me, you'll look back and wish you were coddling yourself the whole time. I'm still in recovery myself over a year later, but I will never forget the path here.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"(first of all sorry for my english, it is not my first language)

So basically i’ve been trying to recover from my ED for a while now and it’s been really hard. Almost no one knows this besides my therapist and a few friends (i’ve always struggled with opening up about my ed, even with my family, therapist and my closest friends.) 
Back in march, i became friends with a girl that i’m pretty sure that has some kind of eating disorder, she always is talking about how she never eats or how she fasts for insane amounts of time. We share a lot of classes together and she always skips lunch and doesn’t eat during the breaks that we have. She is always talking about food in very triggering ways and is really competitive about it when we do eat together. It’s been extremely exhausting and triggering for me, it reminds me of my days when i was deep into my own ED and it sucks. When i’m with her, i feel so guilty for trying to eat like a normal person and it’s really fucking with my recovering journey.

I really don’t know what to do bc i don’t want to stop being her friend, she is the only friend that i have in college and i really like and care about her, besides this issue. But i don’t feel comfortable sharing my own issues, i don’t think i trust her enough for that and i don’t want her to compete with me even more since she will know that i have an ED.
I would love to tell her to stop talking about things related to food and her ED when i’m around, but i don’t think that’s right either, it would be so selfish, i just can’t ignore the fact that she is constantly starving and damaging her health, even if she is not looking to recover any time soon, i’m still very worried about it.

I've been thinking of creating a video on my recovery so far and focusing more on the experiences I've had (excessive hunger when I didn't actually know what hunger felt like, the energy surges, the bloating, the increased bodyheat because no more icepack hands, that kind of stuff) and kind of just talking about the things that so many ""ED Story"" videos seem to miss out.

I haven't decided yet if I'm going to use photos that I've been using to track myself, or if I'll include numbers, or if it'll just be me talking to the camera.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi all, so I've been in recovery for a little over a year now, since ~ April 2021.
Last summer, I overshot and kept gaining weight all through winter into spring. I've made the mistake of weighing myself, and I realized that I overshot my pre ED weight by a full 40%. Now, I know that weight changes with age, but I was 21 when I first got sick and I'm 25 now, so it's not like I was a teen back then or got any taller.

So I'm extremly worried that I'll just keep gaining even more, I had to threw out ALL my clothes and I can't buy new ones every few months!

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So as I’ve mentioned in here before, after four months of unknowingly being in a somewhat pseudo recovery restricted state, I am back to eating a ton and I can already see the telltale signs of increasing metabolism, not least of which is being hot all the fucking time and sweating.

But I was thinking back to the 3 months over the winter where I was in full blown recovery mode and what was different.

The answer is mindset.

I wasn’t compulsively checking my body. I wasn’t constantly thinking about my body or recovery. I trusted that I was doing the right thing and that the water weight would come off and slowly it really was. I was engaged in my career, my life, my wife and children. I was being patient and I had lots of energy. I had ups and downs during that time but the downs were very minor. I had zero insomnia and I had no anxiety.

Why?

Because being in a positive state of mind actually effects your physiology and we all know that. But also being in a positive state of mind made it easier to do the self care I needed to do to get out of this nightmare. And when you’re eating enough, your parasympathetic nervous system is more dominant. You have better vagal tone. Which then lowers your anxiety making it easier to be positive and more mindful. It’s a spiral up.

My therapist used to tell me you either spiral up or your spiral down. It’s your choices that make the difference.

Well today, despite feeling like not doing this, I’m recommitting to seeing the glass as half full, to trusting the process, to trusting myself, and most importantly trusting God that he knows what’s best for my body and my soul. If I balloon up to a thousand pounds of water, so be it. Im going to enjoy my life and enjoy food and enjoy this process. Im going to choose to love my body exactly as it is today, with all the water weight and everything, and recommit to that every day and I will not beat myself up for mistakes or for pseudo recovery. I’m learning lessons like an innocent child, which is what we all need to be.

I know this isn’t like a light switch but as adults there are small practices we can do daily to develop the habits of realistic but positive thinking. Breathing exercises, journaling, working on small changes to obsessive thinking. I highly recommend the book “Learned Optimism”. In fact I may just read that again now. We have to trust ourselves and our bodies to patiently make the tiny steps. We must forgive ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 33 years now and suffering from anorexia for more than 17 years now... so long that I really can't imagine a life without but im so sick and tired of this way of living. I have a good social life, a part time job and I actually love food and drinks. The thing is anorexia gives me control and a kind of '''safe'' feeling.

I already suffered from an ileus ( testine obstruction/failure) when I was 25 and did die almost. I spent 5 weeks in the ER because of medical complications such as kidney failure because of my bad body condition. Luckily, I recovered from this complication.

I never reached a healthy weight since my 16th and currently having a BMI of 14, which for me is very low but when I compare to others, my ed tells me its ok. Family friends and medical support are very worries for me since they are telling me im very very thin and are suffering for so long, I really have to keep gaining and trying to recover.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"TW - I mention an approximate weight for myself.

You’re probably wondering wtf I’m talking about. But first some background…

I’ve been in recovery for 8 months. In the beginning I was eating a TON like 7000 calories a day. I’m a big guy, let’s just say I’m over 2 bills, not weighing so I can’t get specific. And I have been retaining tons of water for months, as I have bitched on here about many times before. 

I’m not afraid of food, I have no restrictions, I am not afraid of fats or carbs, thanks be to God I actually love food now.
In the last several months I thought my appetite had stabilized at 3200-3500 cals a day. But my energy was depleting and I was just still sitting here like a big water balloon full of water… and then it hit me, I haven’t been really honoring my hunger.
But not because of emotional or mental desires to restrict, but simply old patterns of life. I got so used to “fasting” in my old life that lately I was just delaying breakfast which would practically ruin my appetite for the rest of the day. It almost seemed hard to even eat 3000 some days.

So yesterday I got up early and ate breakfast first thing in the morning and HOLY MOLY THE EXTREME HUNGER HAS RETURNED - clearly I haven’t recovered. I ate 6 meals yesterday and I tracked damn near 6000 calories. I have been an absolute vacuum cleaner ever since. Even in the middle of the night last night my body woke me up to eat. My pants fit more loosely on me today than they have in months. Water going away? I sure hope so!

I’m super happy I figured this out but it’s also a bummer because it feels like I wasted months I could’ve been recovering, but maybe I just wasn’t ready yet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I call it “convenience anorexia” because it is sometimes just easier to not eat because you’re so used to not spending much time eating - I used to eat once every other day for example.

Getting out of this involves re-confronting ourselves so many times over and over and confronting fears of imperfection, rejection, pressure etc. All we can do is move forward and keep trying to get better. Trial and error. We must bravely be willing to get up and try again.

I’m going to sleep with muffins and other goodies next to my bed tonight so I can eat them before I fall asleep and first thing in the morning!

Anyway I hope this helps someone. Please give any advice or experiences that might help me feel normal about all this hunger!! How long did extreme hunger last for you? And did you ever have multiple bouts of it?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I had IBS symptoms during the first 3 years of recovery. They disappeared a month ago. I am sharing my own story and I'm wondering if anyone else wanted to share their experience with recovery and gut issues.

In 2019, my first year of recovery, I had nausea from pretty much everything.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hey guys.  I'm now a year and 3 months into all-in recovery.  In fact, I no longer meet any of the DSM criteria for anorexia nervosa.  However, I'm still not completely in the clear yet.  The first year I was ravenous of course, but it's leveled out to a manageable hunger level over time since I honored every craving.  I still need to be extremely diligent with maintaining my food intake, because if I don't eat enough, my body protests and I feel physically ill and it also triggers feelings from the past.

I've been having a lot of stomach issues that persisted past the first year of recovery.  I went to the ER last month for vomiting blood and now I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy on Monday (they suspect an ulcer or something similar, NOT related to recovery). I have to use laxatives for a few days, and tomorrow I will be on a clear liquid fast.  I can only have apple juice, broth, and lemon jello.  I also have to avoid nuts, seeds, and corn a few days.  Asides from pausing my ample milk intake for a few weeks after the ER (to give my digestive tract a break), this is the first time I'm restricting my food intake in any way (which I am EXTREMELY proud of).

I'm especially nervous for the liquid fast.  I'm scared it will trigger old feelings from when I used to restrict.  Additionally, I know for a fact I won't be able to sleep the whole night since my body won't let me sleep at all if I don't have enough food, and I know a day of clear liquids only won't cut it.  I need some support and words of encouragement since this is very rough for me and it makes me nervous to have to do anything to resemble restriction.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"hi all I've found this subreddit to be very helpful the past few days. it's a lot to read but I appreciate you a lot if you do. 

I'm 20. I have been struggling with anorexia-binge purge type for almost 6 years.

In October 2020, I was referred to a program at my hospital to get checkups on my eating disorder. i was I'm major denial about being sick or needing help. none of my symptoms stopped. In early 2021 there was some progress in my weight but symptoms were still there. This is possibly due to the fact that I had no therapist or full outpatient team because "" I was too busy"" like I said. 

I was constantly told I'd have to go to the hospital if I didn't stop and was recommend to go to php. I kept saying I was busy. And I still just didn't want help. 

When August 2021 came around, I got worse. I felt my energy decreaing quicker, work performance was bad, I didn't return to college. I got into a relationship in which I let my insecurities get in. My boyfriend wasn't fully aware of my situation or what even an eating disorder was, so a lot of things were said that I took to heart badly. 


In October I started calling PHP programs and also Residential programs for help, but was turned away because insurance. So I gave up. I quit my job in December, and decided to try and look for help again, but no luck. I thought I'd use the time off work to focus on recovery but I just kept getting sucked into the eating disorder more. 

Frequent doctor visits and seeing that I was declining in weight more, I grew happy. I found a therapist but I didn't seem to care. Until April 2022. I almost passed out in a public place. An ambulance came and my blood pressure was low. I spent 4 days in the ER. I realized something needed to change. That I didn't want to die but I also don't want to gain weight.

I stopped binging and purging slowly but I still felt sick due to not eating at all. In May, I was at my lowest and decided to go into the hospital for refeeding (as recommend by my doctor. I had called a residential place that had a admission date for me, but in the end didnt work because insurance. 

I ended up doing PHP from June 23rd up until a week ago, because I was told I needed a higher level of care, even though I know I've been eating my meals and not binging or purging. Turns out I'm still loosing weight even if I'm eating. 

I'm not sure what to do. I want to get better and I don't want my weight to continue to fall. I just want to be healthy. I've seen my doctor but he said to go to residential possibility, and hell see me in 2 weeks.

I am eating. I am doing my best. I know I need help and I'm looking for a new therapist and now a nutrionist. But I'm scared my weight won't go up for weight restoration.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"!! TW !!

I'm sorry for this post as it won't benifit anyone or make my situation better. This is also not meant to get anyone to try to save my decision. I wish every person suffering to recover and experience happiness.

After trying hard to eat every day, gaining kilo after kilo and falling deeper into my depression and addicition, I can't manage to do this anymore. 

The more I gain, the more I take and it's wearing me down to a point where I don't leave the house anymore, start fights about eating for others(as I couldn't find the strength/motivation in myself)and generally lost myself in the process. And even worse, my bad mood and my ego lead me to give into my addiction, enough to lose my best friend which I've known since I was just a few months old.

I know it's possible, I know it just needs more time, but I can't stand the Stress anymore. I may get into my habits of burning out again, but I can't manage more than that. I want to work and go out again, everything, social, work, school, is suffering from my recovery. I fucked this school year up, I can't do another one. And now, I need to focus on my life, not my weight and ""well-being"".

I'm sorry, but I have to leave this sub. I appreciated the help and I'll try to motivate every person I see to look into this sub, as y'all are such loveable and wonderful people with the best intentions to help others and give great advice at any time.

Through calorie restriction and exercise, I have lost weight below my body's natural comfort zone and have a BMI of about 18, on the high end of underweight.

Since returning home from college dorms at the end of the term, my mother has been persistent with her comments about how I do not eat enough, need to bulk up etc. Furthermore, I have been battling stubborn injuries that will not heal and I suspect it is due to my undernourishment. I have experienced many of the symptoms associated with being underweight like being tired, cold, irritable, and constantly thinking about food etc. On account of the aforementioned reasons, I have decided to make an attempt at recovery. I want my health and fitness back, this ED has made me tired, weak, and injury prone.  

The other day, I decided to go ""all in"" and honor my extreme hunger. I am recovering at home sans professional supervision. Because I am not severely malnourished, I do not think I am at risk of refeeding syndrome. Anyway, I have been making big batches of trail mix (Trader Joe's stylewith nuts, dried fruit, lots of chocolate chips, butterscotch chips etc.) Even after a full meal, I will still feel hungry and begin snacking incessantly. In the past two days, I must have eaten like 6+ cups of trail mix, lots of granola, protein/snack bars. It is absolutely ridiculous. It is getting to the point where I am eating snacks so constantly throughout the day that regular meals aren't even appealing because I have eaten well beyond my physical hunger cues. Is this ok? Should I take a more calculated approach of just 3 meals +snacks? Or should I continue to just raid my pantry every 20 minutes and only sit down for a proper meal if I am feeling inclined to? Bare in mind that with all the snacking, I have been consuming 3000 calories MINIMUM. Probably closer to 4k+ My stomach is a little uncomfortable from all of the food but I am trying to nourish myself with low volume calorie dense foods to avoid digestive distress (hence the trail mix).

TLDR: Since going all in, my extreme hunger has lead me to snack incessantly. I have been devouring high energy foods like trail mix, granola, bars, shakes etc. It’s like all I’m doing is eating.. is this ok? Has anyone else experienced this?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So I’ve posted in here before that 7 months in to recovery I had really fully committed and MAN did I get serious water retention. All over. Feet, legs, pregnant looking belly. Just wild. 

Now I’m another month in, 8 months.

I have actually upped my salt intake and pretty much ceased all exercise (I take a very short walk to a pond and chill there and then walk back like twice a week). 

What I’ve noticed is the salt has absolutely obliterated me having any insomnia or anxiety.

But also finally my feet are becoming more normal. I’m able to actually see some veins in my feet. I can see my ankles and even my ankle bones again. However the water has increased in my biceps (the muscles themselves), which is crazy they feel and look massive like I’ve been lifting weights, and I haven’t. There is more water in my hands right now, too, but I guess it moves around as it is trying to repair, but even that seems to be alleviating. There is less pain in my feet, and I’ve noticed that washing my hair no longer makes my arms feel exhausted. I am very very annoyed by my big ass pregnant belly, especially because I am male. I feel like my muscles are currently being rebuilt.

I’m just trying really hard to commit, and just stick with it. I am starting this week with an ED therapist and coach. Mentally I am 100% over restriction and would never even dare to go back (for me a switch flipped and I just don’t think I could ever switch it back), but I need help with managing my feelings about recovery in general, as well as edema.

When will it stop?? When will my weight finally stop going down and start going up like my eating has been intending??? I’m so worried ): please tell me this is normal and everything will be okay&lt;/p&gt;

Literally, I only could have sex once a year when I was ill and always had to under the influence because I felt so inferior and unworthy of being touched plus I couldn’t feel much pleasure anyways.

But now it’s been a year into my recovery, and I’m starting to have “sexy” days, days where I look at myself and FEEL desirable . I could fantasize about sex and yooo, I could even enjoy masturbating ! 


I just leave this here for anyone who’s wondering if their sex drive will come back. It can and will if you just keep supplying your body with the healing it needs . It can and will come back if you learn to recognize body dysmorphic thoughts are not REAL and people will never ever see you the way you see yourself. Stay strong y’all.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"It can’t be any other way around. It’s a fucked up chicken or egg dilemma considering I only developed depression after years of starving being underweight, but still even in this new body the depression has only worsened . I’ve been in recovery for a year now and made the most significant gains imaginable like almost not a single behavior is engaged in anymore, but since I restored my weight ...feelings of worthlessness have only collided with the life the ED put me in .

I haven’t had a single friend in 6 years. With such loneliness, I feel empty and will always want my body to reflect this state. What about hobbies? Well, I have hobbies without having interest in them because wtf you can’t go years and years of your life without someone to share your hobbies with. You cannot engage in hobbies when you constantly feel doomed from having no friends. 

My husband has been nothing but supportive but best believe, an unhealthy life will not form a healthy relationship. You cannot be lonely , friendless in a long term relationship without that negative energy arising . There’s just really no way around that . 

So for the past few days, I have been slipping slipping pretty badly but I do not feel as this slip is consciously “anorexic”. I have no thoughts of losing weight, no thoughts of restricting calories . I just simply do not feel any need to eat because of how worthless and pointless my life is. Eating makes me feel more depressed and I do not want to relapse but my god, I feel like I’m reaching a dead end.

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a single friend in 6 years. With such loneliness, I feel empty and will always want my body to reflect this state. What about hobbies? Well, I have hobbies without having interest in them because wtf you can’t go years and years of your life without someone to share your hobbies with. You cannot engage in hobbies when you constantly feel doomed from having no friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband has been nothing but supportive but best believe, an unhealthy life will not form a healthy relationship. You cannot be lonely , friendless in a long term relationship without that negative energy arising . There’s just really no way around that . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the past few days, I have been slipping slipping pretty badly but I do not feel as this slip is consciously “anorexic”. I have no thoughts of losing weight, no thoughts of restricting calories . I just simply do not feel any need to eat because of how worthless and pointless my life is. Eating makes me feel more depressed and I do not want to relapse but my god, I feel like I’m reaching a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody tells me this gets better because as much as anorexia robbed me of a life, I feel powerless in knowing how to get it back . I fucking lost it all .&lt;/p&gt;

anorexia took everything from me. it took over the entirety of my life, consumed my every thought, and stripped me of everything that makes me who i am. it destroyed my family, my health, my value system. i was a shell. and i didn't care. because it made me feel better about myself. and i figured it was worth feeling a little tired and cold sometimes. because what if i got better and hated myself again. but i had no idea. i forgot what life was supposed to feel like. i couldnt enjoy anything anymore. i dreaded any kind of movement. i was so upset with everyone around me for pushing me to get better. i was tremendously stressed at all times. my thoughts revolved entirely around food and weight and numbers. the world was black and white and i didn't even know it was supposed to be colourful.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I am an athletic guy and pretty average in the weight / physique department (I just completed an Ironman!) However, for jeeze, must be 18 years of an eating disorder? Thinking of food daily, restricting, periods of severe restriction.

The underweight isn't what's making me want to recover... It's the guilty, shame and how depressed I get if I eat anything bad.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hello all-**HUGE content warning for numbers/talk about body image**

I’m having a really tough time holding onto trust and just wondering if anyone else has experience with what I think I’m going through-
I’ve recently (like in the past week) finished a 4 month inpatient stay (went very well!) and am now back at home. 
I reached a healthy BMI (20) from a very scary 12 and over that time and it’s quite alarming to me how uneven my weight gain has been-a lot of bloating, fat in my torso, upper arms and upper thigh (the rest of my lower limbs are extremely lean still??)
My body pre-Ed was a very different, normal looking shape, a lot of my weight was in my legs and I had quite dense muscle due to my hobbies (weightlifting, cycling, hiking) 

It’s hard to look in the mirror, I just CANNOT recognise myself, it’s like the body of a menopausal women?? Still don’t have a period though which adds insult to injury lol

I’ve heard about uneven fat deposition during recovery and I’m having a really hard time believing that it’s true.
I’m trying so hard to trust in the process and that I’ll get my healthy normal body back or as close to it as possible-additionally, I’ve been cleared to do some formal exercise again and I’m scared that jumping back into my hobbies will hinder the redistribution process (if it is what I’m going through)

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Part of me feels vulnerable and weird about it but I’m trying to focus on feeling glad that my body’s getting healthier and happier. I lost my period for 2 years and after 7 months in full recovery it still hadn’t come back. I was worried that something was wrong, more than I’d thought. Did something irreparable happen in there?? Was I doing recovery right?? 

And then a couple days ago it came back. I was at work and I wanted to cry and felt so many conflicting feelings at once. But I had a really loving “recovery win” experience surrounding it yesterday that made me feel so much better and proud of the work I’ve been doing.

I’ve been isolated a lot but yesterday I went to a friend’s house and another friend drove down to join us, we had a super yummy meal and a couple beers and were just chatting. We were talking about hormones and body cycles and I blurted out “guys, I got my period back yesterday after two years🥲”. I think I just wanted to share it with someone because recovery has been so fucking hard. They both knew I’d been struggling with anorexia and trying to recover,  and when I said that they both broke into huge smiles and gave me high fives and a big hug. They said they were so proud of me for healing my body and just celebrated with me for a minute. It made me feel so loved after being trapped alone in that secretive prison of a disease for so long.

I guess I just wanted to share this because even though getting our periods back (for those of us in recovery who have uteruses) can be scary and conflicting and maybe even disappointing even in the midst of recovery, it can also feel empowering to know that our bodies are responding to our hard work.

But there’s no set timeline for amenorrhea to cease if that was part of your symptoms (and you are still so valid even if you didn’t lose it!). It can take time for hormonal cycles to readjust.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So I have had Ana for a year now. Before my ed, my skin was nice and healthy. It was smooth and plump and I had colour in my face. 

In my Ana phase, my skin started to peel, it would be very very oily in the Tzone  and my face would feel grimy. The most annoying part was that my skin was broken in the cheek area. My makeup would look SOO SOO cakey because of the outer layer peeling. I just started recovery and am still going through these skin issues.

1. Peeling and broken skin in the cheek area

In order to try and improve treatment options for eating disorders, I'm trying to better understand the process of recovery and what motivates it by looking at the role online support groups (such as FB groups, discussion forums and subreddits) have in their members recovery.

Taking part involves completing an anonymous online survey consisting of eleven questions altogether. Three are short demographic ones and eight need a little more time and attention.

The link to the survey is posted below. In the very first question there is a link to the participant information sheet which has the full details of my institution and contact details for the departmental ethics committee.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi everyone,

I was referred to a hospital program last year for anorexia but the waitlist was so long that I ended up trying to recover at home, while seeing a therapist and dietitian. I was able to restore my weight and although I still struggled with a lot of anxiety and BDD, I felt that my eating patterns were starting to seem borderline ""normal."" There was even a point mid-April (of this year) when I felt myself having healthier thoughts about my body, weight, and clothes, and breaking many of my food rules without anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

At that time I was following a meal plan insofar as I was eating at specific times each day and paying attention to food groups, but it was fairly general. I trusted it and felt good physically and mentally. Then around the end of April I noticed I was forgetting about some of my eating times, or skipping the last one due to genuinely not being hungry. This was very new for me as I'm someone who has always struggled with food obsession when I'm engaging in ED behaviours.   


Over time things got worse, to the point that right now—and for about a month and a half—I feel nauseous when I even think about food. Nothing at all appeals to me and I don't feel any physical hunger. I thought it was anxiety at first, or a symptom of covid (which I had in April and it had some lasting effects), but my husband suggested it might be a new way the anorexia has found to take hold of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I struggle with this explanation is because it is truly so unfamiliar for me to not WANT food, even when I've been at my ""most anorexic."" This sensation seems entirely physical, and I know psychosomatic symptoms can be very strong, but I don't have any prior experience with physical symptoms from anxiety or depression. Is it possible I'm outsmarting myself because I got too ""good"" at recovering the way I was doing it? The last thing I want is to go back to the way I was before, and so although it doesn't feel like my ED to me, I don't want to risk it. Has this happened to anyone else, or have you heard of this happening?   


Thank you so much in advance.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi everyone. 

So I've been recovered for several years now. But when I was actively anorexic, I lost a fair amount of my hair. What little I had left I actually pulled out myself during my PM feeding time panic attacks. It was awful, I used to have such beautiful thick hair and that part of my body never truly came back. 

Now I'm in my last year of veterinary school, on clinics. It's absolutely grueling. I am at the hospital at *minimum* 60 hours a week, plus time I spend studying for the board exam and preparing my research manuscript. I barely get to eat, and the sheer stress is so overwhelming. My skin is breaking out, healing poorly, and I have hair falling out in clumps. It makes me feel so awful about myself. I'm only a month in, I have 11 more of this. There will be nothing left by the time I graduate. 

I talked to my mom about it and her first response was ""Are you sure you're not pulling it out yourself?"" I wanted to go the f\*ck off on her, tell her ""You think I want this? That I've thrown all those awful years of recovery away? Do you not believe how awful this all is, that you think I'm lying to cover up a long-gone ED behavior?!"" Like come the f\*ck on, I call you every other goddamn day positively sobbing about the stress.

For context I’m male and I’ve been all-in for 7 months with maybe 2-3 minor relapses and haven’t had a relapse at all in several months. I love food and am no longer afraid of it. I don’t weigh myself but I’ve definitely weight stabilized, and it appears maybe even slowly some of the water is starting to taper off but sometimes I feel like it never will. Hilariously I find myself wishing I could replace the water with fat, because water is so tight and uncomfortable and limits mobility so much.
A friend of mine who recovered long ago said to up my salt. That the doctors in Mexico told her that and that she dropped the water afterwards. From my research on minerals and salt, this actually bears out - too little salt can lead to edema actually more than too much (so long as you drink enough water your kidneys will pee out any excess salt) and considering we have upped our amount of food, perhaps the salt isn’t sufficient to support the amount we’re eating.

Or rather, THEIR mental health.\n\nWhen I see youtubers, for example, talk about their mental health struggles, they are usually well put together in appearance.

And we will especially never understand what it is, to be in their life, going through it for years on end, as a friend or family member.\n\nWith Eugenia, unfortunately, her ED is at its peak. It makes her far less then the best person she could be. And when a person is in the middle of that storm that is the accumulation of their mental illness (whether it be an ED, depression, Bipolar disorder, you name it), people don't like that person.\n\nPeople, I think, HATE that person. The person who is at their worst because of their mental illness.\n\nBut rarely on social media do we see this person. So as a society, we are ill equipped to understand them.

They resort to frustration, anger, blame, toxic vitriol, shame, abuse. They get impatient, angry, per haps self righteous.\n\nThey don't understand why something as obvious to them, which is to seek help and recovery, isn't so painfully obvious to someone like Eugenia.\n\nEugenia forces us to confront an ugly reality. Not so much about what the illness can do to a person.\n\nBut rather, the reality, that supporting someone with a mental illness is a lifelong, multi-year commitment. The reality, of our helplessness.  Our lack of understanding. Our limits. That we will get angry. We will lose patience. We will think horrible thoughts about the one we love. We will hurt them, just as much as they will hurt us. That kindness will not always get through. That as online strangers, even with our best intentions, can never hope to reach her.\n\nShe has given us a taste of the reality of what it is to be that friend, to be that sibling, that partner, that parent.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I had anorexia for 4 years, from age 16/ 17 to 20. I started my recovery in the spring of 2020, went through extreme hunger etc, and gained a lot of weight — about 25 kg initially. That was fine, I was okay with it, I knew it was part of the process.

My weight had more or less stabilized and I was at 85kg for a long time. Last year however, for a few months I lost some of the weight and went down to maybe 75kg. This wasn’t intentional and was because I was so busy and active that I guess I wasn’t eating as much as I needed. After this however, my weight went back to 85kg and was stable at around this weight again.

However, in the last 2 months I’ve noticed I started gaining weight again. I tried not to freak out about it, and hadn’t weighed myself for the past few weeks, but tonight I finally did and have discovered I’m now at 89kg. I have to admit, I’m pretty upset about it. My bras and clothes are starting to not fit me. I don’t have the energy or mental capacity right now to go buy myself an entire new wardrobe. 

I don’t know what’s happening or why my weight is suddenly shooting up again. I’m just feeling very lost and confused. I think I eat pretty intuitively, like I eat when I’m hungry and I stop when I’m full. I also eat a bit of junk food or sweets sometimes when I’m craving it, but it’s not all the time. I just don’t know wtf is going on. I’m eating the same way I have been from the beginning of my recovery, and from when my weight was stabilized at 85kg. 

There are only 3 things I can think of that might possibly contribute to weight gain?? 
1. I have been taking Wellbutrin for the past few months. But I don’t know why it would only “kick in” with the weight gain now instead of 3-4 months ago when I first started taking it? 
2. My meals were pretty irregular these past few months. I was fasting without really intending to, because I’m depressed and would wake up and not have the energy or motivation to make myself a big breakfast or to feed myself super regularly during the day time. But, I’d eat a lot at night and by the end of the day always felt satisfied (not still starving). However, I have since fixed how I’m feeding myself and am eating breakfast and lunch every single day, and not unintentionally fasting, and eating larger portions for breakfast and lunch so that I’m not starving in the evening. 
3. I did a parasite cleanse this past week in the hopes that it might help me with my IBS. It made me feel super out-of-it for the first few days, but now I’m feeling all normal again. I know parasite cleanses can release heavy metals (from the dying worms, they tend to hold on to heavy metals) and I have heard before that when the body is faced with toxins that it can’t process right away, it tries to store it in fat/ gain fat in order to put it away somewhere “safe” that won’t damage the body.

Besides these reasons, could it just be the natural process of recovery? Has anyone else experienced this, where your weight suddenly shot up in the middle of your recovery out of the blue? If so, how long did it last/ how long did your recovery ultimately last afterwards? I’m trying to be patient with my body but I’m just so tired of living like this. It’s exhausting having to manage my body image issues, shopping for clothing, etc. All that while I am struggling with bad mental health issues and a ton of issues in my family. I also have serious body dysmorphia, so this is triggering me A LOT. Not to mention, it’s almost impossible for me to find clothes in my size because I live in Asia and everything here is made for tiny people (I grew up here and am living with my family atm).

,AnorexiaRecovery,"It's weird. 

About a month ago I kind of suddenly just decided I'm sick of this. 

**tl;dr** sick of this shit

I'm sick of the constant anxiety and distress - about food, about my body. I'm sick of wanting to tear at my flesh to get it off me. I'm sick of it never being enough. I'm sick of being exhausted and catching every stupid bug going around. I'm sick of food being ""scary"". I'm sick of the nonsense rules. I'm sick of being terrified to leave the house because people will perceive me. I'm sick of the *constant* bodychecking. I'm sick of adding up and counting everything. I'm sick of feeling like I'm failing. I'm sick of the shifting goalposts. I'm sick of my flat mood and explosive temper. I'm sick of the horrible things I say to myself.

I'm so sick of hating myself.

This stupid illness stole the last 3.5 years from me. I'm lucky that I've been able to study and maintain a relationship - but it stole almost every waking hour from me. It stole my time and it stole my joy. It stole my boobs and my ass. It even stole my hair. What a jerk.

It promised me that it was worth it though. It promised me that it would take the hurt away. It promised me that it would make me safe. It promised me that I wouldn't feel anymore. It promised me that I would like myself again if I just went a little further.

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I kind of suddenly just decided I&amp;#39;m sick of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; sick of this shit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sick of the constant anxiety and distress - about food, about my body. I&amp;#39;m sick of wanting to tear at my flesh to get it off me. I&amp;#39;m sick of it never being enough. I&amp;#39;m sick of being exhausted and catching every stupid bug going around. I&amp;#39;m sick of food being &amp;quot;scary&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m sick of the nonsense rules. I&amp;#39;m sick of being terrified to leave the house because people will perceive me. I&amp;#39;m sick of the &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; bodychecking. I&amp;#39;m sick of adding up and counting everything. I&amp;#39;m sick of feeling like I&amp;#39;m failing. I&amp;#39;m sick of the shifting goalposts. I&amp;#39;m sick of my flat mood and explosive temper. I&amp;#39;m sick of the horrible things I say to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so sick of hating myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stupid illness stole the last 3.5 years from me. I&amp;#39;m lucky that I&amp;#39;ve been able to study and maintain a relationship - but it stole almost every waking hour from me. It stole my time and it stole my joy. It stole my boobs and my ass. It even stole my hair. What a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It promised me that it was worth it though. It promised me that it would take the hurt away. It promised me that it would make me safe. It promised me that I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel anymore. It promised me that I would like myself again if I just went a little further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a liar and a thief.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in recovery for a couple of months, I’ve started to eat without any restrictions and I’m also listening to my mental hunger. So far I’ve gained some weight and most of the time I’m okay with that.
The problem is the extreme hunger which is really extreme. I still have problem with eating during the day because I wasn’t used to it and even now I’m usually busy so I end up eating huge amounts of food at night and I’m scared I’ll develop binge eating.
But even though if I eat bigger amounts of food during the day I still end up eating a lot at night. 
Also after I eat something I’m literally hungry in an hour like I didn’t eat anything before.

&lt;p&gt;I also have insomnia which I never had before. I think it has to do with the swelling because my limbs throb, and stomach pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So I discovered I had anorexia through being diagnosed with “adrenal fatigue” with a lot of insomnia involved and then putting the dots together to figure out the cause was anorexia. Been recovering for 7 months, the edema is nuts. I have been supplementing with sea salt because I think from all of my not eating my body was just stripped of salt, so I figured out probably 18 months ago or so that salt helped me sleep.
But out of my desire to get rid of the edema I cut the salt I was supplementing. My sleep has been trash and my anxiety higher, until finally last night and tonight (now) insomnia has hit.

It scares me to reintroduce salt supplementation because I’m not wanting to balloon up again. But I need to trust the process and that also, perhaps just drinking enough water and finding a happy medium with the salt will help me find a healthy spot to be at to heal without having to control what that looks like.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I’m a man, 37 years old, and I’ve been recovering from anorexia (hidden as “dieting” and “fasting” for 20 years) for 7 months and I’m doing it on my own it seems. No one wants to believe I was anorexic because I was “ripped and fit” and so I’m completely brushed off when people see me now and see I’ve gained all this weight. I feel like if I were a woman and even mentioned eating disorder everyone would be compassionate, but because I’m a man I get laughed at and scoffed at. Usually followed by FUCKING DIETING ADVICE that I most certainly did not ask for.

It took me 14 months of “adrenal fatigue” - which I think is just code word for “anorexic/orthorexic who doesn’t want to accept it” before coming to terms with my issues.

I would say that emotionally I’m very far along in recovery. I can enjoy a milkshake without guilt. I like food. I enjoy making memories with my family at mealtimes. I also like trying new things and I am in love with fruit (fruit used to terrify me). Like I LOOOVE fruit. And ever since I started eating and loving food - poof - adrenal fatigue disappeared. So I’m happy. More energy, heart rate is no longer Bradycardic, it’s finally up to normal range.

But holy moly the edema is killing me. I gained some fat, sure, and honestly I don’t give a f about the fat. The edema is killing my feet. It makes life so hard and uncomfortable. My weight has stabilized (I don’t weigh myself but you can tell), and even some of the water has come off - I realized I was supplementing sodium for the “adrenal fatigue” and a few weeks ago the sodium drink started tasting like absolute garbage to me, so I listened to my body and stopped taking it. Since then the edema came down about 20% and now I can actually to some degree function. But man I want it gone. Any tips? Recommendations? I feel like one day in this body takes 20 x more energy just to get around than it used to. It’s soooo tight but also SOOOO heavy. Water is heavier than fat. Everything hurts. I feel like my life is passing me by - playing with my kids is hard, work is hard. I just want to move on from ED And live my effing life.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi im male (26) I started dating a girl (24) a few months ago.  I suspected that she was anorexic bassed on how little she actually eats on dates and meals we cook together. Last night she opened up to me and confirmed that she was in fact anorexic. She has struggled with it since she was 4 and has been in rehab twice for it and the emergency room countless times. 

The old me would be wanting to fix it right away, but iv learned I can't take that mindset. I wanna help her but not take on a savior complex ( I do like her and I could see us going long term) but I'm worried on how I can best support her, and help her stay healthy. 

Any and all advice you have to help me learn about anorexia, how I can best support her, questions i should ask her, the reality of being in a relationship with someone who has anorexia, and anything you think someone in my possession should know about would be great.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi everyone. I’m new here, 29F, but honestly I’m not sure if I belong here.  I have struggled on and off with periods of hating my body, restricting my calories, and obsessing over my weight.  It started in 2018 when I was 25.  My whole life I had been tiny and chronically underweight due to having been born severely premature at 26 weeks.  My entire childhood was focused on getting me to eat more and gain weight so I could grow.  By the time I reached my adult height I had stabilized my weight, but was still classed as underweight to a not insignificant degree.  

It was in my mid 20s when I first noticed that I had started to gain weight, and was now classed as having a “normal” bmi, albeit at the very bottom end of normal.  For some reason this terrified me. It was like for the first time in my life, I realized that I was just as susceptible to “getting fat” as everyone else, and I started significantly reducing my caloric intake and weighed myself obsessively, multiple times a day.  I eventually dropped back to the weight I had been at during adolescence, and I felt better and stopped restricting.  Of course my weight went back up, and in 2020 the panic set in again and I went back to restricting.  Again I returned to my baseline weight, and felt better and stopped the restriction.  I’m now back two years later, having the same struggles as before with hating my body, being terrified of gaining weight and carefully monitoring my calories while keeping daily track of my weight.  This time though, the voices in my head are more insidious than they have been in the past.  Previously I had been satisfied with my adolescent weight, but now they’re telling me to push it just a little farther, to see just how far I  can go.  I’m aware of the dangers of losing too much weight, but my brain is telling me that what I want doesn’t count as too much, and I’m having trouble knowing what to believe.

I spoke to my therapist about all of this this afternoon, and she said I could be considered “diagnosable” for anorexia.  I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that I could have an eating disorder, because my symptoms don’t seem “that serious”.  I’m scheduled to speak to a nutritionist next week, and I’m terrified at the thought of her telling me I need to stop restricting my food intake.  Earlier this week one of my other therapists asked me to do her a favor and increase my caloric intake back to a level that would sustain my current “low/normal” weight at least until I speak to the nutritionist, and I had a panic attack.

I’m just very confused right now, I don’t know if my current predicament is serious, and I don’t know what to do to make the angry voices in my head telling me I need to lose weight go away, if it turns out this is a problem.

I don’t really know why I made this post, I guess I just needed some people to talk to who’ve been through it, and who could reassure me that I’m not crazy.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So..I've been in some kind of recovery for the past 9 months, I gained a bit and classify as 'normally underweight' at the moment. I mean, I feel like shit. I feel worthless, my bpd symptoms are getting worse and worse, depression has been hitting me pretty hard, especially while I was trying to get off my addiction to benzos..The worst thing is, I gained a lot and lost a lot of weight this month and it's obviously confusing to see my body change from one thing to another in a span of 4 weeks. I don't know if I need to vent or get advice at this point. I started not going to school again and I deeply wish to be able to restrict again as I don't feel like myself at all. I started triggering myself after my bf had to leave for school last sunday(he's going to a boarding school about 1 1/2 hours away)as I was reminded of a trauma through the fact he's going on his final drive and will be even more far away. It's so hard to realise he's not my ex, which left me cold turkey for 3 weeks, after we were together everyday for 1 1/2 years,to go to poland with his family, telling me he knew since yesterday, that his grandma was sick, ect ect. Oh and his phone broke, so he couldn't contact me during his holiday while he was partying with his uncle on coke, meth and whatever else he took. I don't wanna know. All I know is that I almost died in these weeks last year. And I guess this triggered me. I didn't realise what my feelings were about since yesterday, but it's still hard to deal with. I didn't go psycho this time and distanced myself at first, because I know how hard it is to understand what I'm feeling when I'm in an episode like that and I truly don't want to hurt him. He's too precious to me to ever be abusive or mean or anything else to him and I promised I was going to get better. Our sole priority is to be healthier, this is our goal and I love how much good we're doing to each other. But I started lacking. I know it's not really my fault, but there were 2 incidents on May 1st. Both in which I got sexually used or absued and it's tearing me apart. I don't even know how many times this has happened until now. I'm not in therapy anymore, but I immediately looked for help after all of this went down. Yesterday I've had an appointement at a womens counseling centre with our school pedagogue and it was amazing! But I'm still overeating like crazy and everything feels so heavy. My head is spinning around all these responsibilities. School, work, friends and a relationship..damn that's hard to manage. And besides from all that chaos is me. My doc just told me I'm overworked and need to rest. Because of all the work I did in the last few months I may as well will have chronic pains in my right arm, which I painfully had to accept after wrting 4 double pages of vocabulary yesterday..
But as all of this is going down, I can't seem to rest. I've been thinking about hurting myself or even ending my life, because I can't take it anymore. I'm trying so hard. I don't want to be addicted, I don't want to hate myself, I don't want to fail in school, I don't wanna leave my job and stay at home again. I'm done feeling like this and I know I'm the only one that's able to change this, but as hard as I try, I can't even be honest. Sometimes I physically couldn't speak even when I tried to. On that sunday, last week, I had a panic/anxiety attack and it's getting worse. For about 10-15 minutes, I was frozen. When I finally woke up, it took me another few minutes to move my fingers and then a bit of my body again. All of this is scaring me. I'm always on edge.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"
Hello all, 
This is my first time posting in this subreddit but I’ve been following along for a while and really admire how supportive and open of a community this is as I’ve seen ed and anorexia spaces online just breed a lot of harm. 
I am 22 transmasculine, but present in quite a gender non confirming way idk i say this because dysphoria was so much wrapped up in my dysmorphia of trying to disappear my body and it feels relevant somehow, how people perceive my body to what I have to share. I have long hair and I’m African and not really interested in passing as a cisman at this point though I am on T and my soul tinges every time a stranger refers to me as lady... in any case. I do feel like across the gender spectrum thinness is generally lauded as desirable and since low body fat de emphasises and a shift in my fat distribution subdues body features associated more with the feminine I feel like I get social positive affirmation to stay thin. 

At this point in my recovery, I’m out of college after it drove me to psychosis, and am at a healthy weight meaning -according to my blood work- my organs are all functioning. However, partially due to my stimulant medication and never actually instating regular patterns of eating(?) I do not eat most days or really an amount that is severely under daily recommended minimum but it is not out of an active desire to restrict it is just kind of routine. I also work out quite intensely 4-6 days a week for about an hour fifteen. 

I have a low body fat percentage but because of my muscle mass I am not ‘underweight.’ 

I still feel strong impulses to control how I look especially due to the positive reception I have received for my body from others trans and queer people. But I do not want to live like this. 

I want to be able to feed myself and eat and have some energy and semblance of regularity. I don’t want to use food as a place of self denial.  

I am currently in intensive treatment for a different. Psychiatric disorder and when I talk to my care team about my Ed I feel like they don’t take me seriously I have been in the outpatient programme for over six months and now one has given me a referral for a nutritionist even after I explicitly asked my psychiatrist.

For the past year I’ve been recovering from anorexia very slowly. I’ve been battling my body thinking the pain, swelling, and exhaustion is wrong and is not supposed to happen.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"A little over a month ago, I was taken off of my ADHD meds which I didn't fully realize were a kind of big contributor to my ED. For the most part, it was kind of an unintentional ED, combined with a lot of eating issues I had post-COVID (suddenly allergic to some foods, many foods tasting different and bad, so having to force myself to eat random things that are tolerable). I was originally taken off due to concerns I expressed over cardiac health. I did a holter monitor for 48 hours and no problems were found. But my doctor never discussed with me an alternative treatment for my ADHD, nor has the topic of going back on my meds come up. Sometimes I want to ask about going back on meds, other times I'm like, nah, no meds is good for you. Mostly, being off any meds has been... weird.   
Like, some days I find I function pretty okay, other days it's like I'm lost in space. And in terms of recovery, there were days I was miserable when I was totally unable to gain weight, in constant physical discomfort/pain - so some days I'm glad to be gaining and then the other days...  


Well, the other days are the reason for this post: the bad days seem to be getting worse. The other night, I literally woke up crying because I had a dream \[or I guess \*nightmare\*\] where I was getting ready for work like usual and before heading out the door, looked in my full length mirror and I had gained a bunch of weight and I had huge elephant-like legs?? I literally said horrible insults to myself in my dream and thats when I woke up in tears. As a result, I found myself yesterday being hyper-critical about eating and wound up restricting.  
I mean, what the hell???? I'm in my mid-twenties and dealt with anorexia when I was in high school too, and NEVER did I have a nightmare that was obviously my sub-conscious freaking out about eating or gaining. In terms of mental illness relating to the ED, I'm way more fucked up over the recovery process than I was throughout the whole time I kept losing weight, since it was almost all unintentional. It's only now I realize it actually was an illness and not just ""la-dee-da, long-covid making food suck, whoopsie I'm losing weight!""  


I don't know if I'm making any sense here. I guess what I'm wondering is, has anyone else had these weird nightmares? And has anyone else had the kind of weird journey of unintentional weight loss followed by a very unsettled and fear-stricken recovery process?

It&amp;#39;s only now I realize it actually was an illness and not just &amp;quot;la-dee-da, long-covid making food suck, whoopsie I&amp;#39;m losing weight!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m making any sense here. I guess what I&amp;#39;m wondering is, has anyone else had these weird nightmares? And has anyone else had the kind of weird journey of unintentional weight loss followed by a very unsettled and fear-stricken recovery process? I just feel so frustrated and SO alone and weird and sometimes I feel... not valid? Like, some people do really extreme tactics and I just... had zero appetite or deadass forgot to eat for days.  It&amp;#39;s fucking weird and I feel weird and I hate everything and I&amp;#39;m really struggling to avoid deliberate restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I am so sick. And so uncomfortable. And just dreading everything I put in my mouth. 

Is this even because of recovery? Or is it something else? 

I'm not sure what's even relevant. I recently started ADHD medication which has allowed me to start tackling my eating issues. 

I got pre-made meals so they're super easy and I did stellar for a solid 5 days. Eating 3 meals a day. Probably still not enough, but I wanted to work my way up. 

Day 6, and the subsequent 6 days rolls around and I am DYING. My stomach hurts all the time. Super bloated. Nauseous. Urgently need to use the bathroom after eating. And pain. Like I can't move. I've spent the last week in the fetal position. 

It seems totally random. Some meals totally set it off. Other times it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Even if it's the same food. Even water upsets my stomach. Movement sometimes helps, other times makes it worse. 

I'm currently living off tums and gasX and digestive enzymes which helps a bit. I started taking a probiotic. And I have a constant stream of peppermint/ginger tea. 

I guess my question is, is this normal? Anything else I can do? Does this last a long time (everything I've found online suggests months to years)? 😭 How do I survive it?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"This Monday I had my grad school graduation and expected all to go well because I’ve been weight restored for 7 months , psychotic symptoms have subsided completely, and I only get intrusive thoughts here and there and in no way feel like the ravaged starved animal that I used to be. 

However, Monday proved otherwise and I’m beginning to understand much like this illness is a lot deeper than a desire to lose weight, so is the abstract nature of a “recovery “ from it, i.e,any disorder of the brain would have symptoms that persist regardless of engagement in behaviors associated with it. For me, I still cannot handle large crowds .

I used to cry at big events because I couldn’t understand why everyone was so happy while I just felt like a loser. That feeling came back intensely on Monday. I felt inferior to everyone around me as if everyone was secretly making fun of me. I didn’t experience this until my 4th year of being underweight and since the body has a memory, I suppose those same intense feelings of inferiority came back in full force for my grad school graduation .

I’ve tried to understand why it happens .

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Day 3 of recovery.

The extreme mental hunger has been ***wild***.

I knew it would be, because I was getting such bad extreme mental hunger before. 

That's actually why I decided to just try and recover - because the overwhelming and constant looping food thoughts and mental hunger has been driving me crazy. Completely distracting me from my work, relationships, etc. 

I can live with the physical hunger and effects just fine they don't bother me, but it's the mental side of it and the constant food thoughts that become intolerable. And ultimately just annoying.

Anyway.

I'm a PhD student in the UK, I'm funded but we only get paid for 3 years (when most people need 4, maybe even 4.5 years to submit). I'm at the end of year 3, so I'm about to stop getting paid because my stipend runs out (and I'm nowhere near finished with my research so I'm going to be flat out broke for a long while - perhaps a year)...

Basically, I just do not have the means financially to respond to all my mental hunger.

I see these Instagram accounts of people in recovery who are always at cafes, restaurants, ice cream parlours, cake shops, pizza places, ordering takeout etc... I simply just cannot do that. 

Does anyone had any advice for this kind of situation? 

Is recovery still possible if I can't meet every single mental hunger prompt?#

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I don't know what happened but it's like a switch flipped in my mind one day and I feel liberated...

What I have learned is that physical recovery takes a long time and mentally you can't recover before you're healthy physically. 

Right now I am at a weight that would have made me cry and hurt myself with harsh exercise and dieting before. 

Somehow right now I am thinking... It doesn't really matter.

It's okay to have a soft, round body that does not look like that of a Kardashian or a supermodel. My thighs and my stomach are pudgy but they are cute, is what I tell myself.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"hi, i was wondering if anyone had any advice for travelling when in recovery. I'm going away in a month for 2 weeks with my boyfriend, and I will be weight restored just before I go away if I continue to hit weight targets each week (which I have done so far). Obviously being weight restored brings up a ton of ED crap, and I know the obvious is ""eat what you want"" etc etc, but realistically it's not practical for me quite like that - I also have Coeliac disease, which went abroad is a nightmare because of cross-contamination (aka I have to know where we are going before eating, have very very limited choices, which sometimes means the chef is just making stuff up).

My boyfriend is aware of my anorexia, and really helpful, but I am just terrified of weight gain - I won't be able to weigh myself at all whilst abroad (I normally do weekly weigh-ins, which will continue until I've maintained my weight for long enough), and obviously there is the standard diet culture shit about how much weight holiday (vacation - I'm in the UK) causes people to gain, etc etc, because of all the eating out. This is all so terrifying to me and I'm currently having multiple breakdowns a day even though this is in a months time.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I maintain my weight when on holiday? Is this even possible - I can't find any literature which speaks of it, it is all about weight gain, and I will only just have been weight restored (yes - I know it is normal to overshoot, if I go home and weigh myself and its overshot, I will be at quite high risk of relapse - it is safer for me to maintain - all it would do is prove everything my head is telling me).

&lt;p&gt;Although I’m weight restored (been 7 months now), my breasts haven’t really returned to the size they were when I was 17 although I weigh a bit more now than I did pre-ED. I’m 27 years old now and really hate how I spent all my adult life in the body of a kid . My breasts were a B cup before I was ill ; now they’re almost a full sized A although I feel like it doesn’t match my shape very much . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read of models and athletes like Alexa Bliss with long term anorexia getting breast implants during recovery because even after weight restoration, their breasts never fully developed and I wonder if it’ll be the same for me . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should get my sex hormones checked but since I’ve been getting regular periods since 2018, I guess that’s not the case. But people always say my voice still sounds like a teenager plus I still have a youthful face so I wonder if my hormonal development was stunted somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hey, I’m in recovery from anorexia and see both an ED dietician and a therapist (am in UK), and was wondering if anyone had any advice around walking. Since I’ve left higher levels of care, I’ve managed to continue tackling so many fears, and I’m ready to take the next step and completely cut out walking. Currently I do a 1hr-90 min walk extra a day, alongside a few 5-10 min pops into uni here and there, and I don’t do any other form of exercise other than very gentle yoga (approved by dietician - yes I have spoken to her about this but it hasn’t offered much help). 

I was wondering if anyone could offer up any scientific studies, or themselves as an example, that proves stopping the 1hr-90 min walk did not cause them weight gain. Regardless of whether this does cause me weight gain, I will be stopping it, i just can’t find any research or experiences which show that you don’t have to walk to maintain weight - everything is about weight loss or preventing weight gain. 

I’m aware I have disordered beliefs around weight gain - please don’t point this out - bear in mind I am in recovery from AN and this is something I am working on. This scientific proof would just help my brain justify it even more.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hey All,

I don't really post much, but I'm finding this really difficult and nobody else knows what I'm going through... so I thought I'd post something on here.

I've been recovering (or at least trying to recover) from anorexia for around 2 years, but I still weigh myself every day and count everything I eat. Recently, I hit the same weight I was before my ed started (I was just in the normal weight range, even before it started) even with weighing myself every day and not eating 'normally' as I did beforehand... and my head just hit a mental block and I started restricting again.

It's taken around a month of spiralling downwards for me to realise that I'm not going down that road anymore. I want to get better. So... I've decided to ditch my scales. I haven't weighed myself in almost a week, and it's so difficult. I'm trying to eat meals again, but it's so hard without my security blanket... but it's something that I think I need to do to get better.

My ed voice keeps telling me that all my clothes won't fit anymore and that I'll have wasted a load of money on unwearable clothes; it keeps telling me that if I don't weigh myself I'll put on so much weight I'll disappoint my parents and be depressed and unhappy.

I don't know if I can keep going but I'm going to try. I want to get better so badly. I think not weighing myself has made me worse in the short term, as I'm starting to get extremely obsessive again.

Anyways, I just needed to tell someone, somewhere, and I'll try to post updates on here, so anyone going through something similar doesn't feel like they're alone.

I asked my cousin for advice and she suggested I don’t force her but instead I create an environment where she would feel the need to eat or something like that. Any advice? Mainly about foods I could cook/order?

(sorry about possible mistakes, english isn’t my first language)

For context: I’ve met her about a year ago when I changed schools. She’s always been very skinny and I never saw her eat during break (we don’t have lunch at school in my country), so I already understood something was up but I never confronted her about it as I didn’t know her very well. Luckily, due to some circumstances, she opened up to me and this other friend of mine (17F) about her anorexia.

Me and my other friend always made sure we created a safe environment for her to feel loved and comfortable so that she would come to us when she needed anything and eventually help her seek professional help. A few months ago, after a little breakdown she had after a test that went bad (because her struggle got in the way of her studying properly) I managed to convince her to talk to one of our teachers who is know to help students with both non mental health and mental health related issues. Thanks to the help of this teacher and other happenings, she finally made up her mind and about a month ago the teacher talked to her parents and she started going to a therapist.

The therapy just started so I don’t know if she already started recovery or not but I do know that she feels overwhelmed mainly because of her family making comments about her not eating or studying. Her mom also texted my other friend to see if she eats and we don’t know what to tell her.
So now she says she’s coming because her mom wanted her to go have lunch with her cousins and uncles and she says she just wants to stay with me and this other friend because we are the only people making her feel good in this hard times. I’m glad she feels comfortable with her issue around us, but I don’t want the fact that she feels comfortable with us to be an excuse for her ed not to eat.

I told her it would be just the three of us eating so she won’t have to worry about my parents but that since we’ll be preparing something she should eat if possible but not to worry because no one will force her. I was thinking maybe I should cook something light so that it will ease her more than something more caloric but idk.



Edit: So we had lunch and she didn’t eat anything but it’s ok for me as long as she still feels comfortable and knows me and my friend are there for her when she needs us.
I wanted to clarify that I’m not too worried on the whole situation as she already has a main source of help from the therapist and I already know she’s a very strong person so eventually she’ll manage to overcome this. I mainly wanted to use this as an occasion to inform myself on the topic, as I don’t have many people to talk to about mental health related subjects in my life and I want to know what is the best way to support her as her friend.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: So we had lunch and she didn’t eat anything but it’s ok for me as long as she still feels comfortable and knows me and my friend are there for her when she needs us.
I wanted to clarify that I’m not too worried on the whole situation as she already has a main source of help from the therapist and I already know she’s a very strong person so eventually she’ll manage to overcome this. I mainly wanted to use this as an occasion to inform myself on the topic, as I don’t have many people to talk to about mental health related subjects in my life and I want to know what is the best way to support her as her friend. Thanks everyone for the advice they gave, it really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to think all my anorexic thoughts would disappear once I managed to eat over 3,500 a day and gained back all my weight...well, it's been 11 months, I have no desire to restrict but holy shit, it's as if I'm still anorexic but just one who rejects all  behaviors now and hates herself for ever having anorexia in the first place .

I've been weight restored since November after battling AN for 10 years (16-26 years old). My body has changed a lot in recovery and it's changed in ways that I did not expect. I longed for a curvy, womanly body as someone whose spent all their adult life resembling a kid but I didn't get that body; instead what I have now is a teenager's body with extra weight on it, one that looks as if it's just entering puberty... I know things will even out in time or maybe not at all but how do I cope with summer coming along when I'll be constantly bombarded by women who have perfect bodies ? I know this is my ED talking but it's so hard for me not to feel ugly and worthless.

I am still flat chested, I have some hips and thighs now, but the wideness of my mid-section (all the weight went there mainly) makes it hard to notice any curves.  Plus with rib flare from anorexia, my ribs still pop out even at a healthy weight so I just find all of me to look incredibly weird.

I didn't think it would get THIS hard, but within my 11 months of recovery, I have realized this : a healthy weight DOES NOT equate to a healthy mind nor does anorexia just revolve around starving and obsessing about weight. It is a disorder of mind with a disconnection from the body. It's a disorder of intense self-hate and constant inferiority. It's a disorder of NO self-worth .

I do not restrict anymore and I have not even weighed myself at all these past 11 months except at doctor's appointments, but still I feel a deep disgust with myself for not only having anorexia in the first place but constantly wondering what my body would've been like if I never developed it at all...

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I was wondering if any of you were diagnosed with GERD or heartburn problems during/after refeeding and what treatment you got for it.

I am a year into recovery and re-feed myself with unrestricted eating.  Last December, I had a severe chronic cough and vomited involuntarily multiple times a week.  I thought this was just side effects of refeeding so I didn’t see doctor 
until last week.  

I was taking an H2-blocker twice a day before I saw her.  Then she prescribed me a PPI (Prilosec) for 14 days in the morning with H2 blocker at night.  The idea is hopefully after 14 days of treatment, my stomach will be healed enough from the acid to go on normally.  She also sent me handouts for GERD and heartburn.  Some of the advice is to avoid certain foods, but to put it bluntly I will not be ever doing that because I know I am not ready to do any sort of diet modifications without it eventually turning into more harmful restrictions.  And frankly, I don’t want to give up foods.  

So did any of you get treated for GERD or heartburn?  What did your treatment look like?  How long did it take for symptoms to resolve?


Thank you!

Edit:  I will add that my question is more aimed at people in long-term recovery (8 months or more of All-in recovery, not “quasi-recovery”).

IMO can bloat you, make you constipated, nauseated, and make it feel like your intestinal motility is slowed. A couple ways to get tested are through SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) breath testing, or test like Genova's GI Effects that check for methanobrevibacter smithii in the large intestine. Just thought I would spread the word in case others are going through something similar. Treatment isn't easy, but it can get better.

I'll put studies and resources for further reading in the comments. I've also been researching for months since so few non-functional or naturopathic doctors seem to be that well aware of the condition and what it does to you, so I'm happy to help answer questions if you have any.",t2_fwlal99d,False,,0,False,Struggling with digestive issues after an ED?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi! First post on this sub! I’m wondering if anyone has ideas about where to find an eating disorder (specifically anorexia) recovery mentor?

One of the programs isn’t starting their next round of applications for several months, another program didn’t have any available mentors for anorexia recovery, yet another program had too many applicants so I got rejected lol …

Alternatively, if there’s anyone reading this post who’s overcome anorexia/is well into their own recovery and is interested in mentoring someone in recovery, let me know, and we can talk more. :) I’m not thinking of anything too time consuming/intense, maybe chatting every couple weeks or so and messaging in between.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hello all my fellow disordered friends. I hope you're all doing as well as you can considering the circumstances. I just kinda want to rant about something I've been really struggling with and wanted to know if anyone has a similar issue/coping strategies/general advice to give me. 

Sooo I love my friends more than anything. They've been very supportive in my recovery journey, which hasn't been going so well lately. I would say I'm probably almost at rock bottom, and I'm scared, you know?

Well, it concerns my pals when they see me. One pal in particular, I've always known to be a lover of food. They'll eat anything and everything exotic. Not quite sure where my fear/disgust towards food started and why I'm like this, but I just can't stand when this friend talks about their love of food. 

They ask me if I've ever tried certain restaurants, ever tried certain foods, they go on and on about eating and how delicious their meals were throughout their day. They recently invited me over and said we could make dinner together, and honestly I was terrified. Sometimes, it seems like it's all they want to talk about, and that's really difficult for me. 

I don't know how to respond to them. Actually, the topic itself makes me sick to my stomach. Sometimes, it makes me genuinely angry, or feel ashamed, guilty, all those fun things.

I struggled with anorexia for many years as a teenager but for the past 4 years or so I have been healthy and strong.

This has brought health issues such as constant fatigue and aches in my body, specifically my back and my knees, which are so sore it’s sometimes hard to walk. Seeing how my health is being affected is a wake-up call and I now want to recover, I’ve signed up for therapy!

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Like most people, my anorexia started at a young age when I was 14, even though I was already considered underweight. It started with innocent things like trying to ""diet"" and eat less calorie dense food (which led to me passing out and quitting the diet). I didn't even realize it was anorexia creeping in at the time. I've always heard of people having eating disorders, but I feel like I was oblivious for a really long time that I was suffering from one too. I really only realized by late last year that these habits - the body checking, the restricting, never finishing my food, comparing my body to others, grabbing my ""fats"", the super intense fear of gaining weight, feeling good that other people were saying I looked liked bones - had to be from an eating disorder. 

It's always been bad but this year it really took a turn for the worse. I am perpetually exhausted, skipping meals, easily irritated, my ribcage and spines are somewhat prominently showing, and Im not even able to enjoy my meal outside with friends and family. I even have calories of most food that I eat imprinted on my mind. It was making my life really miserable and I knew in my heart that I could be so much happier if I was able to eat what I wanted... The wakeup call for me was when my friend passed away recently. It made me realize that life is so fragile and I am spending everyday thinking and worrying about food when I could be trying to make the most of it. It made me feel so pathetic and I felt so sad for myself. 

I really tried multiple times since then to recover. I keep hyping myself up, telling myself that I can do it and reminding myself of how much happier I will be after. But after awhile, my resolve starts to dwindle and I relapse everytime. I havent gotten very far with restoring any weight at all.

 I guess I just badly need advice right now. How do I actually start recovery even if its one small step at a time? The all or nothing approach to recovery makes me feel too scared and anxious so I was wondering if there were any small tips that could push me in the right direction, or even any words of encouragement and similar experiences :( I know I could badly use a therapist to help but my parents told me to stop going to therapy the last time I went for my depression because the fees were too expensive for us. I feel really hopeless, like I'll have to live with this illness till I die, but I feel so exhausted of this body and it's getting harder and harder to even get up and do basic tasks because I don't have the energy to...

,AnorexiaRecovery,"One year ago, I went all in with my anorexia recovery.  With no slip ups the entire time.  Despite being so sad and terrified at the thought of leaving my comfort zone.  I had anorexia nervosa for 15 years as young as age 12, so it has been so hard pushing back against everything I ever knew.  But it was worth it.  It was worth every anxiety provoking moment and every triggering moment from stupid doctors who don’t know shit about anorexia nervosa and dumb ignorant people who would make pregnancy comments because of my very prominent recovery belly.  There were even tears especially in the beginning months, but I fucking did it.

A year ago, almost every one of my ribs showed and I had a very concave stomach.  Now for the first time ever I no longer fit in children’s clothing.  Shopped in the women’s section for the first time in my life as a 27 year old woman a few days ago.  Recovery was sooo hard for me because I was most insecure about my stomach that I starved myself to the point of my stomach completely disappearing without realizing how severe it got.  And as a consequence I got a large recovery belly that made me feel awful.  But it’s starting to feel empowering.  My thoughts were ridiculous during the eating disorder since I never had much of a stomach, but now I see that life is not terrible even when I do have a bigger stomach.  That worry was all in my head.  My body image is a work in progress but I feel better about myself each day. Not to mention the health benefits: my hair grew back, lower blood pressure, no more anxiety, better sleep, I can actually concentrate, I no longer feel like passing out multiple times a day, etc.  

The biggest thought that kept me going at 100% every single day for a year was that the sooner I go in, the sooner it will all be over.  I didn’t have faith in the process at the beginning, but now I completely do.  Since I’ve starved since I was a preteen for 15 years and became skin and bones, my recovery timeline and overshoot gains  were greater than average.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I post frequently in the r/TherapeuticKetamine subreddit.

New research was presented at the International Ketamine Journal Conference in Oxford, England. I was able to attend the conference online.   Study participants with Anorexia Nervosa were supervised on a keto diet for one month and then started treatment with 6 ketamine infusions over 3 weeks.  A significant number of participants experienced remission of symptoms.

In animal models it is postulated that anorexia symptoms were an evolutionary advantage for some individuals in a population related to food scarcity triggering behavior changes and migration to new areas with greater resources.  In a study with black lab rats, food scarcity resulted in a small percentage of female rats decreasing food intake, increasing physical activity, and displaying increased anxiety behavior.

I am a provider that treats mainly Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD with sublingual ketamine.  The response rate to ketamine in the general population is 50-60%.

These study results will be published within the next two months.  This may revolutionize the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Today was my mom’s birthday and she decided to make hamburgers, salad, chiles en vinagre with cauliflower (a Mexican thing hahah) and we also ate an unplanned cake (cause last Sunday we celebrate it with my cousins birthday) and my brother and I picked the cake and I really enjoyed my choice, a carrot birthday cake. I really missed these kind of days were I ate whatever I want

I noticed that last days my parent are starting to worry about me again, telling me that I look extremely thin and I really can’t see that. But I really meditated it and reflect about it, and turn out to be actually true. I started to exercise intensely daily and not eating enough and start to restrict and be strict about the portions again, overthink about foods and starting to check labels again and only eating food that is served on the table and doing body check all the damn time!!! I also told them that I’m fine, that this is my body and I’m happy about it and I don’t care about gaining weight (that it’s actually false cause deep inside me I want to loose more weight and that kind of arguments are a defensive thing to cover my f anorexia)

I start to tell everybody, that this is my cheat day cause I’m fit now (but I think this is turning into orthorexia too) but It’s a big relapsed.

So I want to feel free again around food and not feeling scared, so I’m going into recovery and eat whatever the hell I want cause life is too short to care about other people opinion and what society thinks about bodies. Today I ate my piece of cake but later I want another piece of cake and I ate it! AT 10 pm! That’s a huge win for me, break the fasting stupid rule.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I am now a year into recovery after having anorexia nervosa for 15 years.  At my lowest weight, I had a very concave stomach.  Which is ironic because I was the most insecure about my stomach by far, to the point that it took me a long time to realize the stomach I always thought was “too big” actually disappeared.  So as a consequence, I have a very prominent recovery belly after the refeeding period since a LOT of healing needs to be done in my midsection.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I'll start off by saying that yes, I'm aware this is more of something to bring up to my therapist, but I don't see her until mid/late April. That being said...

My last depression spike hit me hard. Like most spikes there's no reason save for not being sad recently enough. No motivation for life has turned into reaching out for easy comfort foods. Sadly most of my comfort foods are from when I was much deeper in my ED.

Didn't really think anything of it, since it ""comes with the territory"". That is until I started getting fuzzy vision and noticed the return of the brain fog. Then curiosity got the better of me and I did something stupid, I weighed myself. First time in months. I'm no where near as bad as I was, but I'm back to being closer to underweight than a healthy weight. Worse part is my ED voice is ecstatic. I keep hearing things along the lines ""look at what we can do without trying, imagine if a little effort was applied"".

&lt;p&gt;My last depression spike hit me hard. Like most spikes there&amp;#39;s no reason save for not being sad recently enough. No motivation for life has turned into reaching out for easy comfort foods. Sadly most of my comfort foods are from when I was much deeper in my ED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t really think anything of it, since it &amp;quot;comes with the territory&amp;quot;. That is until I started getting fuzzy vision and noticed the return of the brain fog. Then curiosity got the better of me and I did something stupid, I weighed myself. First time in months. I&amp;#39;m no where near as bad as I was, but I&amp;#39;m back to being closer to underweight than a healthy weight. Worse part is my ED voice is ecstatic.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"
(TLDR at bottom)

Me and my girlfriend are both 19(f) and she has had a really bad eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) since she was a kid. 
When we met, she was hardly eating anything at all and all I’ve done is try and support her in getting better. 

The problem is, for the first almost whole year, she refused to get help and would shut down any attempt I gave at helping her (doing all the research about every eating disorder including hers obviously, seeking out recovered peoples story’s, getting my doctor/therapist to help me in better understanding her and looking for more resources, trying to get her to do recovery programs) nothing worked for a while and it took a huge toll on me emotionally to see her hurting herself like that. 

After some time, she agreed to get help but it’s been a rollercoaster (I know it’s to be expected during recovery but it’s really a lot to handle). She has started and stopped the treatment a couple times and every time she’s getting help and doing better I get so happy and proud and then so crushed when she stops. 

It’s to the point where it’s affecting me physically as I’m now struggling to eat, not because I’m insecure about how I look (food used to be my #1 source of comfort), it’s because every time I go to eat now I picture her, and I wonder if she’s eaten today and then my mind is filled with thoughts about her being so dangerously unhealthy and it makes me sick, anxious, sad and unable to eat. I’ve lost so much weight/strength and I’ve noticed my stomach has been having a-lot of problems. I try and eat and can’t now and it feels like I have an eating disorder as well now (obviously different than hers but it still inhabits me from eating). 

I want to know if it’s possible that I have developed some sort of eating disorder and how to help my girlfriend and I. All I ever wanted was to be supportive but I’m slowly becoming less and less because of how much it’s affecting me and I need to know how to be more supportive through all of this, any help is appreciated.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I'm not sure if this is a request for advice or more like a vent, but I'm at my wits end here right now.

My partner(who has anorexia, not me), just got out from their first therapy session at a center specialized for eating disorders. The first thing they told them was to lose weight. I'm not gonna be specific here numeric wise in order to not be triggering. My partner has been in some kind of recovery for a year now(on their own), and they have managed to eat much more healthier and gain weight. Although, they're still struggling a lot mentally and that's why they decided to go for therapy. They have very bad experiences with previous therapists(who should have their licenses revoked) and it took a lot of effort and months of working on it mentally to manage to begin therapy now.

And the first therapy session was a freaking disaster. Who tells an anorexic they need to lose weight? They encouraged them to start going to the gym and gave them more efficient guidelines for some supplements they take so they achieve better weight loss.

I tried really hard to convince myself that this was some misguided way to not forbid them to do things and attempt to coax them to a better way of practicing some things, but buddy, I cannot stomach this.

Why do we have to have such shitty mental health system in this forsaken country? (Not from USA). This is supposedly one of the 2 main organizations for eating disorders and they botched it so damn hard. And it wasn't even 1 psychologist, it was TWO of them.

They also booked her an appointment for a psychiatrist, which I normally would encourage, but given how all this has already unfolded, I bet they will be one of those old-school psychiatrists that prescribe anti depressants for a mere cough(this was the norm here till around 10y ago, now the landscape is slightly changing but at a snail's pace).

They threw some psychology jargon in there(from the first session), which confused my partner even more,something like masked anorexia, which I'm not even sure it exists as a term, but I didn't even understand the purpose of saying it cause my partner is already diagnosed so...

The problem is they now(kinda naturally) don't want to ever attempt going for therapy again and they are really beaten from all this. I know I can't do much about it, I feel so darn helpless. I can't watch them suffer like this, giving up, being slapped in the face everytime they ask for help(metaphorically) by all those charlatans of therapists.

I've found one therapist they possibly could be good for them, it was suggested by my own therapist(which is darn awesome, I was really lucky there) but they can't support it financially right now(neither can I). The only reason I'm hoping it could be good for them is because my partner has loved my own therapist, hearing from me, and this one works the same way my own does, so I'm hoping it could be a good match.

But not right now, and I'm afraid never. This is driving me crazy, I really have no clue how to help my partner.

P.s.: Sorry for the rant, I hope this isn't triggering for any of you. If it is, I'll gladly adjust it and correct it.

That voice is still on my head and I have learned to live with it, but sometimes it comes stronger and I’m not strong enough to fight it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m at the weight I should, eating the calories I had to and prioritizing my protein intake, however, I’m scare I will keep gaining muscle and fat, but I’m eating what I should… Im going to be honest, I couldn’t take all the food my nutriologist was sending and I took some things off the diet, idk if that could impact in my body tonificación eventually, and I’m noticing I’m restraining again little by little, what the fuck am I supposed to do? I don’t want my mother to pay for therapy, she already pays for everything, I have good grades and eventually I will get a scholarship which will help, but what if I relapse during this time? What if I loose all my effort? What if I loose my period again and put me in danger for future illnesses? Or worse, disappoint them? Jesus fucking Christ. Why could I be like my sister who gives zero fucks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man maybe being a eighteen makes this feelings strong, but c’mon I’m getting tired of this cycle. One day I love my progress, MEX day I forget about it and want to be skinny to the bone, idgaf if my hair falls again, I don’t know. I’m lost.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I've been ""giving in"" to extreme hunger when I feel like I can. However, ever since, maybe 3ish weeks ago, my lower stomach (like belly button to crotch area) has been distended and firm. 

I did have a bm a week or so after that with some laxatives. It shocked me so much, no human should poop that much in a day imo. Bloating didn't go away. 

After another week with eating more, sometimes extreme hunger levels, I tried lax again but only pooped a little bit. 

Today I had diarrhea and it worried me because it felt weird, and was basically just liquid. I'm afraid I have an impacted bowel or something. I don't often  experience actual discomfort from constipation so I'm not sure (as a kid I'd regularly go 3 weeks without a bm and not care/notice)

I can't decide if the bloating is my stomach/bowels or weight. I know your body puts weight on in your trunk first, &amp; I guess I expected the stomach/waist area to get bigger but I was expecting like...... fat, which is soft like ykno thighs or arms. I genuinely look kinda pregnant and have for weeks. It's physically uncomfortable. In putting weight on in your trunk to protect your organs, would it be like this?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi all. I have been in recovery for about 7 months (I have struggled with periods of disordered eating for nearly 20 years though this is the first time it’s gotten pretty serious and the first time I sought treatment) and have been gaining weight every week. I have not been underweight for about 5 months, and though weight gain was uncomfortable, I had not approached what I would consider an “unacceptable” weight until recently. I was somewhat relieved by the fact that the weight gain seemed to be slowing down, but this week it increased by more than it had been for several weeks. 

I cannot seem to cope with this anxiety and accept not only this reality, but the fact that it will likely continue to increase to a range that is even scarier for me. I don’t feel like what I am eating is enough to warrant ongoing, unrelenting weight gain at this point and I am feeling incredibly frustrated by the perpetual cycle of disappointment every week when I step on the scale (I have to for my therapy and nutrition sessions), the constant outgrowing of clothes, and the never ending attempts to adapt physically and mentally to the body I see in mirrors and photos.

Now that I’ve reached this point (of gaining in a range that is “unacceptable” to me), I am really struggling to move past this and was wondering if others have been in this situation and how you’ve gotten through it. I feel like by this point in my treatment, I should be able to handle this and am similarly frustrated that I can’t. Even going through the benefits of recovery isn’t really touching it. I also feel angry at myself for probably destroying my metabolism through this process-I feel like it’s all my fault and there’s nothing I can do about it.

I don’t feel like what I am eating is enough to warrant ongoing, unrelenting weight gain at this point and I am feeling incredibly frustrated by the perpetual cycle of disappointment every week when I step on the scale (I have to for my therapy and nutrition sessions), the constant outgrowing of clothes, and the never ending attempts to adapt physically and mentally to the body I see in mirrors and photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve reached this point (of gaining in a range that is “unacceptable” to me), I am really struggling to move past this and was wondering if others have been in this situation and how you’ve gotten through it. I feel like by this point in my treatment, I should be able to handle this and am similarly frustrated that I can’t. Even going through the benefits of recovery isn’t really touching it. I also feel angry at myself for probably destroying my metabolism through this process-I feel like it’s all my fault and there’s nothing I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is pretty long, I’m sorry! Thank you for reading it. Would love to hear anybody’s experience or if you found a successful way of coping with this.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Going All-In?

I am 25, nearly weight restored, but until my Set-Point weight is it still some way to go.

I have been in recovery since November, without a meal plan and gained some weight. But mostly through the extreme Hunger “binges” and restriction cycles. Together with a bad metabolism it does the trick on an objective Level.

But like we all know EDs are not an eating, but mental disorder I am tired of living like this.

I would love to give in to all my cravings and not feel bad about it, even though I am no longer clinically anorexic at this point.

But What is holding me back is my therapist.Every time before the appointments I try to reduce the “damage” e.g. the excessive weight gain by fasting, so that it does look normal. And today she said that I have to gain slowly, because only that is healthy, and that gaining a lot is not good. So now I am scared again to tune in to my hunger, because I now I gain rapidly and easy if I do.

I also don’t really see the point in our sessions. She’s not really helpful.

What would you do? 
Talk with her about it or just end the therapy, because right now it makes things only worse  (every time I leave Her office I am relieved to have some days of ‘food freedom’).

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I’m well aware that my ED developed from childhood trauma, living in a hoarded home with a father who imposed a restrictive diet when I was a kid. I developed anorexia when I was 16, and the intense depressive symptoms of numbness, agitation, low mood, and depersonalization didn’t develop until 2016, my 4th year of being underweight. 

The several psychiatrists I’ve been to failed to see the relationship between body and mind. During the start of my depression, my thyroid levels were abnormal and I also developed antibodies in my thyroid, low iron and vitamin D as well as stomach ulcers. I never went to an endocrinologist when I was ill because I was too ill to care. 

Now fast forward to 2022, and I’ve been weight restored since November but depressive symptoms still remain. Although a new psych has prescribed me with Prozac, I often wonder if I just allow my body more time to heal from 10 years of anorexia, the depression will gradually heal as the body repairs itself from the systemic trauma it endured from starving .

I developed anorexia when I was 16, and the intense depressive symptoms of numbness, agitation, low mood, and depersonalization didn’t develop until 2016, my 4th year of being underweight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The several psychiatrists I’ve been to failed to see the relationship between body and mind. During the start of my depression, my thyroid levels were abnormal and I also developed antibodies in my thyroid, low iron and vitamin D as well as stomach ulcers. I never went to an endocrinologist when I was ill because I was too ill to care. &lt;/p&gt;

Recovery was hard (I had been taking an antidepressant that increased my appetite so I could gain weight, and while this was “good” from an objective POV it gave me horrible mood swings and I felt pretty violent) but tbh these past few months I’ve been feeling way better, I was taken off these antidepressants and changed to Luvox.

I felt like my eating disorder had never happened, and even felt better regarding food than before I got my eating disorder. I was just eating when I felt like it and feeling good and healthy.

He was apart of my 10 year battle with anorexia, so it’s not like he’s totally oblivious to what would hurt my feelings. And this isn’t really hurting my feelings but I get a snippet of irritation and insecurity when he says this.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"So I’m almost eight months recovered from anorexia. Which is good. However, I’ve been pretty MIA from a lot of the friendships in my life because I’ve literally been sick and recovering. I’ve told a lot of my friends about my eating disorder but I feel like many of them don’t really comprehend it and they take my absence as a personal affront to the friendship. OR they act like I’m fine, and I’ve been fine, and minimize the recovery journey I’ve been on. It’s almost like the ED has created a big rift of People Who Get It versus People Who Don’t Get It in my life. 

It’s all just really frustrating and I don’t know how to make people understand. Maybe I can’t. I feel like if I had a friend going through an eating disorder recovery situation and I didn’t understand what it meant, I would do research to try and empathize with them. But the majority of my friends don’t seem to be doing that sooo. 

Anyway I guess I’m just frustrated that I feel not understood or even attacked for literally having a sickness and for doing what I need to do to recover from it. And when my close friends act like I was fine when I know I wasn’t, I was literally starving and dying… sometimes I start questioning “Was it really that bad? Was I exaggerating? Did I imagine it?” But I know I didn’t imagine it. Just certain people are for whatever reason not believing me or pretending it’s not as bad as it was. 

I do appreciate the certain friends who have been compassionate to my recovery process. It just sucks that my close friends, for the most part, haven’t been there for me, aren’t understanding what the ED journey is like, and perhaps even resent me for taking time to heal.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"A few months ago I had an assessment with my local heathcare's outpatient program. They denied me because my weight was too low and told me to put in referrals for a few hospitals in the area. I had an assessment with one of the hospitals today and they also denied me bc of my weight being too low. Apparently, their ED unit is residential and off the hospital campus therefore can't take the medical risk. The nurse said if I could gain x amount in 4 weeks, they would let me in. She was very curt with me and said that based on my history, she doesn't think I could do it.

I understand that but it still stings. 

My next option is an assessment for inpatient at a hospital. They don't have a weight requirement because they're a hospital. My assessment isn't until the very end of march, and after that it'll probably be 2-4 months before I'm admitted.

Wondered if anyone had experience with this program. Her BMI will probably indicate residential treatment. Just don&amp;#39;t want to recommend a program that is awful. The other one in our area is The Emily Program. Overlake tells me they are the &amp;#39;gold standard.&amp;quot; Thank you so much for your input :)&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I would like to start this off by apologizing for the length of this post.

I started actual recovery four days ago. This time, I'm actually committed. It's not half assed, and I'm trying very hard to break food rules. I am very, very scared though. Based on the information I have and have not gathered, there are numerous questions I have. Please, if you can, help me with these. 

Just to reinforce the title, the last question can be a little triggering, or maybe not. I'm not sure, but if I were to see that at my lowest point I would be quite triggered myself. ease proceed with caution (:.

1) Extreme hunger or binge eating?

I read online that in the beginning of recovery you experience something known as extreme hunger. It makes sense, but then I heard someone referring to it as recovery binging. I did some more research and I read that I could be developing BED, that's not my end goal and I don't know how to prevent it. I don't know what it is, but when will this period end? How long does it take, generally? I feel as if it won't ever stop, it scares me. I don't want to call this binging but the more I think about it, the worse it gets.

2) How long does weight redistribution take to occur?

I love joking about this but right now I look like Vector, it's all fun and games until I realize how stupid I probably look to others. I know I should wear baggy clothing but the feeling of uncomfortableness from within does not go away by simply wearing something big. How long did it take for you guys? I know everybody is different but I would like to find an average.

3) When the hell should I eat?

I don't know when to eat, I've been following my mental hunger cues (even if I ate less than an hour ago) and I've been following my rare physical hunger cues, but I don't know when to eat. How distanced should my meals be, and should I wait until I feel physically hungry before I eat?

4) How much should I eat?

I don't want to eat beyond satisfaction and I don't want to eat below satisfaction either but there is no set point to satisfaction and it's making me extremely anxious. I don't like eating so frequently but I don't know why I keep thinking about food, even if I'm full as hell. 

TW // inpatient treatment

5) I have not been sent to inpatient treatment but I feel like I need it, should I ask for it or is it too late?

As I mentioned earlier, I started recovery four days ago but I have not been sent to inpatient treatment. For the past four days I have been eating like shit, and each passing day becomes more and more mentally draining. After doing some research, I learned that the refeeding system is what is generally implemented with beginning stages of recovery. As of late, I have been feeling increasingly irritable due to the amount of food I have been consuming and I am scared of developing binge eating disorder. I understand that this is just extreme hunger but I don't know what to do

I'm scared I'm eating too much. 

I do intermittent fasting 5 days a week. I don't eat between 8-12. the reason behind this is to be able to identify when Im hungry vs when I'm bored. I don't think it's affecting my mental health negatively. I used to think about food all the time but now it's only on my mind a few minutes before mealtime. I feel much better.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I've been having anxiety about my diet, and just need a little bit of validation.

(On the weekends only) 

Breakfast:

2 instant oatmeal (plain) packs 

Banana

Peanut butter (1-2 tbsp)

Coffee with soy milk

&amp;#x200B;

LUNCH (every day)

Brown or white rice (1-1.5 cups)  
Lots of sauteed broccoli, cauliflower, tofu, and peas. (or tempeh) 

Snack  
Carrots and about 1/3 cup of hummus

More Coffee and soy milk (I like a lot of milk in my coffee)

Dinner 

Same as lunch

Dessert (I have every night since I fast in the morning)

About 1-1.5 cups of cereal with banana, peanut butter, and soy milk. On the weekends I have dark chocolate with this (One small bar - 160 cals)  


I'm currently at a weight that I'm happy at:

5'4

100-105 lbs

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm nervous I'm eating too much. I have too much soy milk and maybe too much rice. 

I also run four miles 4-5 times a week.

I love running

&lt;p&gt;2 instant oatmeal (plain) packs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peanut butter (1-2 tbsp)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee with soy milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LUNCH (every day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown or white rice (1-1.5 cups)&lt;br/&gt;
Lots of sauteed broccoli, cauliflower, tofu, and peas. (or tempeh) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snack&lt;br/&gt;
Carrots and about 1/3 cup of hummus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Coffee and soy milk (I like a lot of milk in my coffee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as lunch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dessert (I have every night since I fast in the morning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 1-1.5 cups of cereal with banana, peanut butter, and soy milk. On the weekends I have dark chocolate with this (One small bar - 160 cals)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently at a weight that I&amp;#39;m happy at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5&amp;#39;4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100-105 lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m nervous I&amp;#39;m eating too much. I have too much soy milk and maybe too much rice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also run four miles 4-5 times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just ate the cereal and dark chocolate and peanut butter and banana for dessert and I feel fine but it feels like it was too much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so scared.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hey guys! I'm a 17 year old teenager with an ED that started May 2021 that result me losing my period and went from me being slightly overweight for my BMI (due to lack of mobility during covid) to being almost to underweight for my BMI ( I am an athlete so I probably lost muscle and have a larger body structure which is probably why even at my lowest weight I never dipped into an ""underweight"" bmi) Anyways I ""came out"" to my parents one day about my eating disorder last December as I realize it was ruining my life. I had went from a slightly insecure happy teenage girl to a girl who would only think about food and be angry all the time. I was also cold all the time and when I went on a trip to Las Vegas where it was literally 110 degrees, I was cold. It sucked. My hair started falling out and I didn't feel like myself. In the end, I started scaring myself with the pictures I took off myself. I went to the doctor and she said I had lost a lot of weight and said thats why I had lost my period and she put me on hormones, which didn't even work. At this point I knew I destroyed my body and wanted to recover for myself. It was hard but I started to raise my calories slowly each week by 100. I didn't notice a significant increase in weight and was just happy that I wasn't under a certain number. to put it in perspective, my lowest weight was the same when I was 12 years old. I have since then started recovery with Equip health and it hasn't been easy. I be honest, I still count calories ( in secret), but have increased it to 2,350. They have restricted my movement significantly which suxked because I weight lifted, walked around 1 to 2 miles daily and rollerskated every other day for maybe 2 to 3 hours making me moderately active. I've only been skating recently under supervision IF I eat before and after which has been hard. The first days were especially hard, as they had me eat breakfast. I hadn't eaten breakfast for basically my entire life but taking it to the extreme during the height of ED doing intermittent fasting and not eating till sometimes 5pm. After the initials tantrums about not being in control of what I'm eating and when to eat, its been going great!! This is my second week and I already am feeling so much better! I now have had breakfast everyday, poop everyday ( which is crazy because I've had constipation problems my entire life) and just feel more energized and happy!!! Sometimes its hard to eat things that I don't feel are ""worth it"" or have enough protien, but I feel a lot freerer in general. I haven't been able to see my weight which doesn't bother me too much, it's just kinda of triggering when my parents hug me after weighing me because obviously I've gained weight lol, but the I dont really care and my body looks the same, if anything just a little more filled out but I have so much more energy!! I also have gotten over my fear of oil and its really weird because it only took about a week!! Please keep in mind that this is my recovery journey and that everyone's is different and the quickness of my journey has been not only a shock to me, but my therapists. I've had some great motivators, like as soon as I get my period back, I can exercise more moderately lol and I'm very all or nothing so I put all the energy I focused on my ed into my recovery. I also feel that as I feel better about myself and in general l, its more of a motivator for me to get better. I'm just pretty proud of myself and I want to let everyone here know who is struggling that recovery is worth it and starting sooner is way better than never trying. Another reason I think my review has been faster is because I was anorexic for less than a year. I know some people don't have that luxury, but just know that no matter where you are with your ED, its never to late to start recovery even if it is gradual. I hope this is motivating to you all out there and just know that weight shifts everyday and throughout life we are meant to grow and change.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hello,

I am a 31 y/o male who has been battling anorexia for about 4 years now. I've unintentionally lost a few pounds over the last 6 months after being at an all time high weight/starting to feel better. I've been pushing myself too hard in the gym and a lot of movement at work.

I have been eating a significant amount of calories this whole time. I am getting basic blood work done today (unfortunately not my A1C or glucose - just basic RBC,WBC etc). to see what is going on. I was diagnosed Anemic 2.5 years ago deep into my E/D. 

I've been battling what feels like hypoglycemia and severe anxiety the last 2-3 days. I had these symptoms a couple of weeks ago but it went away. I am getting hard body crashes about 1-2 hours after eating. Extreme fatigue, irritability, dizziness confusion etc. I have noticed some sugar seems to bring me right back to momentarily. The other night I was not near food and went about an hour with these conditions. I immediately consumed a very large piece of dessert cake and felt like I was going to pass out. Extreme chills, shaking, jitters which lasted about 20-30 minutes. This was my wake up call something really isn't right.

I am scared and will do WHATEVER it takes to fix these issues. No more gym. Massive amounts of food. I am going to find another doctor on Monday to test my A1C etc. Has anyone had issues with their blood sugar? Were you able to fix it during weight restoration/recovery?

,AnorexiaRecovery,"**genuinely listen to the TW if you're vulnerable**

Firstly I want to apologise that all my posts are in a similar playing field but I still need to get this off of my chest!

I've had extreme hunger for a few weeks now and it's gotten way out of proportion. 

Today (its holidays where I live) the largest break I've had was around an hour or two to go food shopping, otherwise I have spent ALL DAY either cooking, washing my dishes so I could use them for food again or eating. 

I feel *intense* shame. I go into the kitchen as litte as possible because I dont want anyone to see and judge me.

 Honestly if I felt capable of stopping myself I'd go right back to restriction out of pure panic, which is also so so dumb because I have goals which I can't reach by depriving myself, even now I'm consistently falling back to safe foods and eating lower calorie options even though I know it could sabotage the process. Yesterday I didn't eat for too long and I got so hungry that I detached from reality and the people around me. 

I cannot feel physically or mentally satisfied no matter how much I consume. I cannot concentrate on school anymore because all I think about is food and I don't want to meet any of the people I love because then I won't be able to eat if I'm away from home. 

I'm considering asking my doctor to do a leptin resistance test but I also think im just hoping I have it so I don't feel as guilty. The guilt is mind numbing I swear. 

By this point I think this can't be classified as extreme hunger anymore. What are your thoughts? And do you have any tips on dealing with this?

I grew up in a house with no food. Mom was chronically ill and dad didn’t give half a shit. That led to me scavenging and begging for food from an early age. By 7 I was always packing my own lunch, which was a scant mix of foods that weren’t real foods, like a granola bar. I went to a tiny school and I think the teachers knew my parents were nowhere near poor, but they saw me constantly beg. I believe they said nothing because, how could I not have food?

My brother and I thought a delicacy was microwaving cheese in a bowl.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi, I'm really sorry for posting so much lately but this community makes me feel so valid and understood!

Recently I recognised a pattern. Tomorrow is day 15 of recovery and so far I'm challenging myself by introducing ""new old food"" I liked but didn't eat in the past two years. Last week for example I bought butter and milk because I loved bread with butter and salt with a glas of milk as a child, the other day it was cheese, today hummus. So whenever I buy something like this I go CRAZY. Like I eat so so much of it. And then the next day I have some more but not too much, instead a normal amount. Not because of restriction though, but because that's all I crave. I feel like my body's first instinct is to eat a lot of this new food because it is scared that that will be the last time it can have it, but then it realises that that's not true and I can enjoy it whenever. The first day of recovery I literally ate 4 pieces of cake or something (obviously way more, I'm looking at you chocolate) and I wanted more all the time, but now I'm satisfied with one piece of cake every couple of days.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hello, I see so many posts about extreme hunger but… I’ve been in recovery for a little over 5 months now, and gained weight and have good lab work, and feel better than I have in years. I was anorexic for 15 years. I was expecting to be hit with the extreme hunger many people talk about, but I haven’t had it at all. During the phase you would expect extreme hunger, I did have extreme cognitive symptoms (dramatic mood swings, severe fatigue, irritability) that got worse before they got better. During this time I had no appetite and was still fighting through every meal and snack.

I was anorexic for 15 years. I was expecting to be hit with the extreme hunger many people talk about, but I haven’t had it at all. During the phase you would expect extreme hunger, I did have extreme cognitive symptoms (dramatic mood swings, severe fatigue, irritability) that got worse before they got better. During this time I had no appetite and was still fighting through every meal and snack. &lt;/p&gt;

Hello. Firstly, I think it’s amazing that there is a space here on Reddit for recovering people to find support. I wanted to find somewhere where I may be able to understand more about how I can support a recovering friend. They have been struggling with anorexia for many years now, but they are getting treatment. It is tough, as they are in hospital a lot, but we message and call a lot and I’m just trying to make sure I’m there for them.

Recently they’ve started talking more about their body, and I’m not sure how I can approach conversations about it. As I have never experienced anorexia, I’m really nervous when they make comments on their medication making them gain weight etc. They have been making these comments about their body more frequently as of late. I don’t want to shut down what they’re saying, but I also don’t know how to reassure them in this situation. I feel like being told they’re beautiful etc is something they probably hear a lot, and as anorexia is more than just a physical illness I’m not sure whether it helps to tell them things like this.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"When I was at my lowest weight, something crazy happened while I was in remission from alopecia. My hair was growing THE FASTEST it ever grew before. I had a literal lion’s mane of hair and unfortunately, my sick self was convinced my ED was healthy as my hair continuously bursted in every strand from a previous patch. Now what I didn’t know at this time was how short lived that growth spurt would be. 

Hormonal imbalances in androgen levels contributed to the fast growth but then within 5 months, it contributed to the fastest LOSS ever. About 8 inches of my hair fell off ; I developed 2 new bald patches at my crown and guess when all this happened? 2017. 

5 years and you’d think my hair would’ve grown tremendously by now right? NO. My patches are still visible and the extent to which all my hairs uneven in length makes me hate myself for what I did even more. Thyroid damage stunted any possible growth. 

And I’ve been in recovery 9 months and I’m finally at a healthy fucking weight and Im seeing breakage even now! The new hairs are even growing in matted and just so fucked to where I think I might’ve permanently damaged follicles?

I’m getting treatment from my dermatologist; I apply Rogaine everyday plus topical ointments but my god, how much fucking longer do I have to hate myself like this?! 

I can’t even get hair extensions because my dermatologist said the extra weight and pressure to the scalp will lead to even more fall out.

I've always been told it would come back after i gain weight and eat enough, but this is too vague. What is the actual cause of it coming back?

like why did i even lose it in the first place? did i stop eating enough calories or did i lose a bit too much weight?

i would just like to know, out of interest, could I get my period back whilst still being underweight? (this isnt my goal, dont worry, but i'm just curious).

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I have suffered from disordered eating pretty much my whole life including some intense daily bulimia in my early 20’s and now very restricted eating for a long time. (I’m 35) The past few months things really went downhill and resulted in me being very severely underweight for my height and the lowest I’ve ever been by far. I was an avid runner (definitely over exercising) but then got injured so my activity level is currently zero. I barely have the energy to go up the stairs. 

Today I read Tabitha Farrar’s book and watched a couple videos. I decided enough was enough and this afternoon I got the courage to just let myself EAT. (Cereal, granola, granola bars, protein shake, popcorn, 1/2 jar peanut butter, etc. etc). Of course, I’m freaking out about it now. But I truly do want to recover and enjoy my life. 

I am terrified about binging and becoming bulimic again. And yes, I am 1000% scared of gaining weight. I am so scared of all of it but I know I have to face these fears. I even had my husband take the scale away. 

How do I look at this as not a massive binge and as just letting my body heal. Is it okay that I still want to eat more today even though my stomach is stuffed. I don’t want to make myself sick. I don’t know how I’m going to function if I’m eating like this (I’m also a teacher).

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hey all.  I'm an EDNOS survivor and currently weight restored and (mostly) recovered.  I still have my bad body image days, but I'd like to share how I made it this far and hopefully help someone.

1: Stop weighing yourself.  This seems obvious, but I mean NEVER.  Not even at the doctor's office.  I recently achieved my New Years resolution of not weighing myself for the entire year of 2021.  If you are at the doctor, stand with your back to the scale and tell them you don't want to know your weight.  Tell them you don't want your paperwork when you leave.  They will print your weight on it.  Or decline the scale altogether and give them the most recent weight you know.  No nurse has ever questioned me and they've all been more than accommodating.

2: Set functional goals.  Think of the things you never get to do because of your eating disorder.  Do them.  Mine was weight training.  I always wanted to be strong, but I was constantly tired and malnourished.  If I was tempted to get on the scale or restrict my intake, I reminded myself that I would never get muscles if I starved.  Your goal might be something different, like being able to hike without getting winded, or going out to eat more often.

3: Donate your clothes.  This one also seems obvious.  But it's really easy to slip back into your old jeans and lament about what you used to look like.  Get rid of your clothes when they don't fit anymore, and you don't have to worry about the temptation to self destruct.

4: Imagine the person you love most in this world.  Mom, wife, husband, sister, best friend.  Now think of all the things you love about them.  Not one thing on that list is their weight.

5: Now imagine that someone calls your loved one an ugly, worthless burden on society.  You'd punch them in the face!  Do that to the voice in your head that's low-key a huge bitch.  Punch it in the face.  Shut that shit down.

6: Think of what your eating disorder has taken from you.  Precious headspace for hobbies.  Time with loved ones.  Freedom.  Sanity.  Take it back.

7: Choose life.  You have to want to get better.  You have to CHOOSE to get better.  Every.  Single.  Day.  Even when it's hard.

If I can do it, anyone can.  I almost died.  I have a permanent heart condition as a result of my last relapse.  I literally had to fight for my life to get here.  You, the person reading this.  You can do it too.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"I would say I’m partially recovered, I still struggle heavily daily and still relapse for a few days but it’s been about a year and a half since I’ve been completely problematic.   

When I get hungry it’s extremely violent. The problem is that when I do get hungry it’s about a 20 minute time span that I have to eat.. in those 20 mins food is an obsession I can smell it, my mouth is watering and all I can think about is food.

But, If I miss that 20 minutes though, I completely and usually honestly forget about eating, like don’t even acknowledge it exists and I couldn’t fathom even being hungry. The weirdest part though is how much excruciating pain - physical pain I get when I do force myself to eat after those 20 mins.

,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi All,

I am a long time sufferer of Anorexia since my early teens. I am a male so it was quite unknown back then. I am approaching 30 and wanted to push the boat out from my day-to-day calorie limit.

The hardest part was finding the motivation to make the leap. The actual challenge was doable and my body seemed to love the nourishment. I am going to make a habit of doing more recovery videos on my channel - not always big ones like this (ideas include eating 'fear foods' for a day, overcoming food rituals etc).
