,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hey all, I notice a lot of people here often looking for resources on recovery, or on specific aspects of recovery, such as preventing relapses, stopping calorie counting, stopping body checking, etc. So I wanted to put together a list of resources that may be helpful for those seeking out or interested in recovery.

The main resource in here is the list of 'Recovery Worksheets' from various online sources, most of these worksheets mainly use a modality called 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' (CBT) which helps people learn how their thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and how to stop the harmful behavior associated.

That being said, it's very important for me to mention that I am not a licensed clinical psychologist, and that recovery as a whole can differ a lot between people, what works for one person might not always work for another, so if you read through some of the resources below and don't find one to be particularly helpful for you, feel free to move past it and go on to the next, you know yourself and what you need best. Additionally, if you're currently in a position where you feel as though you need medical or therapeutic intervention and can't commit to recovery on your own, please do seek out the support you need. In the 'Additional Resources' section below, I've included a couple of links to low cost therapy options that might be helpful for some to utilize (they're only available in the U.S &amp; Canada though - sorry about that, all the other resources mentioned however should be available worldwide).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So today is my birthday and I can't help but look back at the past year with a sense of loss. I feel like I lost most of the last year (and a few years before that, if I'm being honest) to my eating disorder. I can't stop thinking about what could've been if I was healthy. Mostly, I just want this period of my life to be over.

I don’t remember most of my most recent relapse. All I really have is the hazy impression of constant headaches and just waiting for the day to end so I could do it all over again. However, I remember the months after so well that the memories feel painful. I was picking my way through the ruins of my life— a sick body, a failed relationship, a personality I didn’t recognize. And I was in pain. Constantly being in conflict with my body hurts. Feeling emotions after being numb for months hurts. Losing access to coping mechanisms hurts.

I never really chose to recover— my body began to heal because the immediate stress triggers in my life went away, it got harder to restrict, and the extreme hunger was overwhelming. I stopped most of the disordered behaviors without addressing the underlying issues motivating them. I felt trapped in a spiral of quasi-recovery, wanting to restrict to deal with the reemergence of my emotions and wanting to recover to resolve my health problems and stop the overwhelming guilt every time I ate.

And there’s been so much anger. Anger that I’m uncomfortable in this body no matter what size I am. Anger that every meal is an internal battle. Anger that has been misdirected at others for noticing or not noticing enough. I don’t want to be a bitter person hurting others and myself.

I, like a lot of people with EDs, struggle with all-or-nothing thinking and perfectionism. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this quote from *To The Lighthouse*:

&gt;The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark.

I kind of wish there were some moment of reckoning, some point where I resolved to dedicate myself to being better forever and that being the end of it at last. We all know it doesn't work like that. Truthfully, I’m not sure I’m even ready to choose full recovery today. It’s a terrifying, uncomfortable unknown and and god, do I like the feeling of control (lmao). But I’m twenty-one years old today and I refuse to lose another year to this illness. I don’t need to continue hurting for the pain I’ve already felt to have been real.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"background info = for a few years i struggled with binge eating and bulimia; about halfway through last year I had gained some weight (assuming from the binge eating and living at college/drinking etc), which drove me to want to lose weight. Over the next few months I healthily lost some weight through exercise and a slight caloric deficit, however it soon developed into anorexia. I became fixated on calories, and over the next few months I started to obsessively exercise and restrict what I was eating. I had lost a little bit of weight and my family had commented on it, but I didn’t really think anything of it. It wasn’t until I started obsessively having to close my apple watch rings and became incredibly restrictive with food (stopped b/p habits by now) to the point where eating and exercise had taken over my life. When I moved to university in Feb I lost a LOT of weight to the point where I had no muscle, was eating less than a toddler, engaging in compulsive exercise and burning thousands of calories a day. I had to cut out exercise when starting recovery because my relationship with it was so disordered i could not afford to lose any more weight.   
This is when I was diagnosed with anorexia and I’ve been in recovery for the past 3-4 months. Since starting my recovery, about a month into regular eating I started getting “extreme hunger” and urges to binge. And when I say binge I mean eating thousands of calories in a sitting. It kind of makes sense since the caloric deficit I created over several months would be MASSIVE so my body is crying for food, and after researching extreme hunger/post starvation hyperphagia, minnesota starvation experiment tabitha farrar, binge eating in recovery, most of these sources have said that I should give in to the binges in to it in order for my body to trust itself and these extreme hunger episodes to go away.  
however this binge eating has become extreme; originally once a week but is now every day sometimes even multiple times a day even though I'm not restricting at all (not purging, no exercise or anything) and I am rapidly gaining weight back (several kg's in a few weeks) and it is terrifying me. I cannot control myself around food, and now I am scared that I have gone from one extreme (AN) to the other (BED), considering I previously struggled with binge eating and bulimia. I am not sure if this is post starvation hyperphagia (extreme hunger after restriction) or a relapse in binging and it's terrifying me because I keep gaining weight, have EXTREME bloating, facial edema and swelling in my feet and feel like I don't know how to eat normally and am never going to be able to exercise again without it being disordered. I am embarrassed to go out in public because of the rapid weight gain, and i'm really not sure if this is a normal response to anorexia and if I should honor my immense hunger? or if i have relapsed into binge eating and i'm terrified its going to become bulimia and im going to become overweight. I just feel like I'm convincing myself it's extreme hunger as an excuse to eat, but no matter how much I eat, even if I am full I am not satisfied.

I am not sure if this is post starvation hyperphagia (extreme hunger after restriction) or a relapse in binging and it&amp;#39;s terrifying me because I keep gaining weight, have EXTREME bloating, facial edema and swelling in my feet and feel like I don&amp;#39;t know how to eat normally and am never going to be able to exercise again without it being disordered. I am embarrassed to go out in public because of the rapid weight gain, and i&amp;#39;m really not sure if this is a normal response to anorexia and if I should honor my immense hunger? or if i have relapsed into binge eating and i&amp;#39;m terrified its going to become bulimia and im going to become overweight. I just feel like I&amp;#39;m convincing myself it&amp;#39;s extreme hunger as an excuse to eat, but no matter how much I eat, even if I am full I am not satisfied.&lt;br/&gt;

I feel like the secrecy is making it worse but I don’t want her to worry about me because she’s already super stressed about everything else.

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve had a slip up with food restriction and purging while she’s been away. The first one this bad in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend is going through a tough time because she lost a family member and had to travel to her home country for the funeral. Since we found out, I’ve been trying to be as supportive as I can since I know she has a lot on her plate. She’s been away for a couple of weeks now and it feels like I’ve been hiding things from her, mainly how I feel my ed rearing its ugly head again. I feel like the secrecy is making it worse but I don’t want her to worry about me because she’s already super stressed about everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid not telling her about the slip up will endanger our relationship and make me full on relapse. But I’m not sure she can take worrying about another person right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on preventing a relapse or protecting my relationship would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

It started with me eating a protein pudding and cereal for breakfast, then also having the two breadrolls I packed for school. I felt so uncomfortable in my body that I struggled with picking out my outfit. I almost missed my bus because of this. At the bus stop, I accidentally turned of my phone. It's a new one and I hadn't memorized the code, so I wasn't able to use my phone all day.

At school, the hot weather really got to me. I had no energy. I only felt better after drinking coffee. Our school sells baked goods as well, but I bought an apple with my coffee instead. I'm such a coward. My teacher gave out chocolate to us in class and it took me a while to muster up the courage to eat it. But I did it. She looked at me while I was eating it. She knows about my ED, because I broke into tears once when she asked me if I had lost weight a few months ago. She's been very supportive and let me know that she's always there for me when I need help.

After school, I had to wait almost an hour for my bus. I killed some time by visiting the grocery store. I got a salmon wrap to eat while waiting for the bus and some snacks for home, since my snack stash is almost empty. I ate the wrap and was full. But mental hunger was still present. I was craving something sweet. I had packed a protein bar for school. And even though I felt like restricting, I still ate it.

I missed my second bus and ended up having to walk home. In the scorching sun. I have some blisters on my feet now.

I feel like I ate too much already and the will to restrict is so so strong. Today's dinner will be burgers. I usually have two. But I'm so scared. Even just eating one will be a struggle for me.

I hate being like this. My ED is so loud today. And it's impacting evrything else as well. I hate everything today. I just want this day to end already.

I know that I need all the calories I can get. I have to eat more. I need to increase to finally start gaining some more weight. I've been stuck at the same weight for a while now. That's the reason I went all in to begin with. But can I really call this all in? When I'm thinking of restricting? When I still get scared of the calories? Fuck.

Maybe I can't do this on my own. I was doing so well these past few days. Today feels like a huge setback. The thought of fasting even crossed my mind. I know I wouldn't be able to do it. But man, I really scared myself there.

I'll have dinner in maybe an hour from now. I'm so scared. I want to cry. But Ill try to push through.

I might give an update afterwards.

I'm sorry for spreading so much negativity.

UPDATE:

I ended up having one burger for dinner. It was yummy. I don't know how to feel about it. I'm a bit diappointed in myself.

On the night of August 12, I got home very late after getting in a very stressful and emotional conversation that lasted about an hour. As I hadn’t eaten in a very long time and was probably mentally fatigued, I helped myself to a LOT of leftover pasta from my family’s dinner, two pieces of garlic bread, and some peanut butter. I then went straight to bed whereas I normally would have done my workout routine because I was so tired.

Since then, my body has felt so different that I am really struggling to feel comfortable in my own skin. &gt;!The scale has been fluctuating wildly: the day after this incident, my weight went up two and a half pounds. It has since bounced around erratically between that higher number and what I usually weigh.!&lt; I will admit that in these past four days I have eaten a lot more than I normally would (mostly in the form of peanut butter, as I seem to be craving it a lot), but those initial emotions of distress aren’t there anymore. In fact, when I’ve eaten these past few days, I genuinely feel fine and never eat to the point of sickness or anything. I’m not bored, either - I just seem to keep feeling hungry no matter what (and for mostly higher calorie foods, too).

More distressing, however, has been how my body actually physically FEELS. My entire abdomen feels not only much bigger than it was, but much squishier. It genuinely feels like I have just a thick pad of water covering my entire stomach that I can’t take off. I have continued to work out but this is not changing anything about how my body feels.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Warning: very much tmi.

Basically the title. My eating disorder started when I was an early teen and I lost my period for two years, which was the major reason why I eventually recovered.

After I recovered I started taking the pill at age 17. I then relapsed at the beginning of the pandemic, but caught myself quickly after a few months. I thought I was in recovery, retrospectively it was quasi recovery though. I was still at a weight that was unnatural for my body. However, I thought I was in the clear, since I still got my period every month.

I suspect that those were actually artificial periods, created by the pill. I changed the pill I was on when I was at my lowest weight and my periods got increasingly lighter. Not even periods really, more like bloody discharge (I have always been a heavy bleeder naturally). I attributed this to the change of the pill, but now I‘m sure it was because of my low weight.

Well, I started proper recovery three months ago. The best decision I’ve made this year. I just walked to the bus stop and I felt something (of course I was wearing white pants).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TW: calories and weight mentioned 

Okay. So, now that it’s been explained to me that EH can be triggered by eating, I definitely have it. When I don’t eat, I’m not consumed or preoccupied by food at this point, but as soon as I start, it’s as if I can’t stop and it’s pretty out of control, especially at night.

At this point I’m hovering around 110-112 pounds at 5’6, up from about 102 or so (I’ve never been that caught up in numbers, but that range). I would say I’m eating about 6k calories a day and have been for the past 6 weeks. After two weeks my weight hit where it is now and it’s not budging. I am aware this is still underweight, but not sure how to gain without literally making myself sick eating so much. 

The EH comes in because it’s super sporadic. Some days I have it and some I don’t, I’d say it’s about 50/50, so some days I hit recovery minimums and others Im going nuts with like 10k calories a day. I feel like I should hit about 125 pounds to truly be healthy. Not sure how to do this without counting and feeling like crap stuffing myself…..anyone else been through this?

I’ve been in recovery for over a year now and I’m doing great. On my way to getting regular periods (have a bit of problems with it on campus but it’s consistent when I am home on breaks :/ )
For over a year now I’ve had lots of digestive problems. (TMI..) Alternating constipation and loose stools with undigested food occasionally, but everyone always says that’s a part of recovery so I figured it would pass. But I’m still dealing with it now.. and things went even more downhill for me in June. Unrelenting fatigue and constant diarrhea/loose stools for the past 6 weeks. Lost a very very slight amount of weight in these past six weeks too (and I’ve eating more than usual) 
Soo my doctor is suspecting celiac.. and if it’s not that a different food intolerance.

She pushes and pushes and pushes until you snap, and once you do she acts like you're the one who started the whole mess.

(I've returned to a pretty healthy weight and am eating regularly, pretty much physically recovered but that doesn't mean its not a possibility.)

,fuckeatingdisorders,"hi all!

i just need to put my thoughts out there right now because it's doing me no good holding them in lol.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Haven't got much to share today, aside from a few wins :)

My boss brought plum cake to work again and I had a slice at lunch break. Then, a few hours later, her mom visited and she brought a freshly baked plum cake. It was still warm, straight out of the oven. I think their family has a thing for plum cake lmao
Everyone gathered to get a slice. And I had one too.
I broke a major ED rule right there. Having two slices of cake, even though I wasn't hungry. And two slices of the same type of cake at that.
But honestly, how can anyone refuse fresh cake out of the oven? It tastes so much better when it's warm. And it was a lot better than the cake my boss brought (which was from a bakery in the city she lives in)

Though, when I cut myself a slice of the mom's cake, she told me to get a bigger slice. I felt a bit weird eating in front of everyone. I usually don't struggle with eating in public, but since all my coworkers know about my ED (my mom told them behind my back... But they don't know that I know) I feel like I'm being watched whenever I'm eating around them or even when food is around. They offer me food all the time. And I used to refuse every time, but I'm getting more comfortable with accepting it. But only if I feel like eating. If I genuinely don't want anything, I won't force myself to eat. It's just hard to differentiate between my ED not wanting me to eat and the real me not wanting to eat/not being hungry.

Tomorrow will be our one year anniversary in our new building and also the last day of work for one of our dentists (I work at a dentist's and ironically, we only ever have sugary food around haha). I've got school tomorrow and usually wouldn't be at work, but I'm thinking about paying them a visit after school. I know there'll be cake etc. And it does make me a bit anxious. Part of me wants to join them. The other part wants to stay at home. I'll decide spontaneously.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"A few weeks ago my mum, whom I live with, was completely exhausted because of her sleeping problems, so I asked her why she couldn't sleep. Apparently one reason was that she was worried about me regarding my mental health, my ""unhealthy"" eating habits and that I don't do sports (bc ""it could really get you out of crisis""). I've told her before that this isn't something I want to talk to her about since I've had issues with anorexia in the past. At the end of our conversation she apologised by saying she was just all over the place mentally which is why she couldn't think straight and choose her words wisely.

And it has changed how I viewed food from then on. I'm very distant from it now and all the past anorexic thoughts are coming back. I'm also keeping my distance from her, because she has hurt me and probably wouldn't understand me or just feel guilty if I told her about my experience.

Yesterday, she asked me how did I feel right now and how my relationship with food was going. I told her that I was better but that i still have this impression of being constantly hungry. And she told me ""oh don't worry, same""

,fuckeatingdisorders,"During my eating disorder recovery, or my attempt anyways - I noticed that I was never truly full no matter how much I ate. 

I always had the fear of eating proper meals. I knew I’d give in to extreme hunger so in a sort of desperate attempt to slow down ‘bingeing’ and weight gain I’d only eat snacky foods. For example, I’d eat a sausage roll but wouldn’t have anything with it that would actually fill me up. Id call the sausage roll a meal even though I wasn’t full; which led to me eating so much more because I wasn’f satisfied.

Anyhow, I’m on holiday at the moment. I vowed that I wouldn’t let it be like my last one where I was constantly restricting and missed out on so many good foods - I’ve just been going for it.

For the first time in so long I feel satisfied? I’ve been eating proper meals that fill me up and it’s so freeing. I haven’t eaten in hours but because I’ve properly fed myself I haven’t spent it constantly fixating on food and what my next meal is going to be. 

I still think about it in some regard but I’m actually EXCITED to try all the good foods here. I know when I eventually get to them the fried donuts will be banging. 

It almost makes me sad that when last time I was on holiday I was still restricting heavily. There was so many good foods I wanted to try but didn’t. Here the foods aren’t as good and its such a shame.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"this is kinda just me screaming into the void. I'm on day 4 or 5 of all-in, and I think I'm doing insanely well and I'm really proud, especially because I'm more-or-less doing it alone.

Anyway, for quick backstory, summer is my biggest trigger and my initial development of Ana (and both subsequent relapses) were all caused by the need of a 'bikini body'. I went through my most severe restriction in may-july recently, but a week-ish ago I decided to recover for real. My mom has been weighing me weekly since late May and constantly telling me i need to gain XYZkg, and controlling my food (just dinner) to make me eat a lot more (spoiler alert she was quite bad at it, obviously.)

I think on the second day of all-in was when she first re-started talking about sugar in a 'stop eating' way. Basically, my stomach was rumbling and I felt really hungry. I knew I would have an ice cream as soon as it stopped raining, and I'd had a big lunch, but I still honoured my hunger (I was so proud, it was my first time in months I'd listened to hunger.) I had a small muffin, but after about 10 minutes I was obviously really hungry again. I had two Oreo's and my mum told me I 'm eating too much sugar and should have fruit. When she turned around, I had a third because I was still hungry.

The next day, we were going to get an ice-cream and I mentioned I wanted two scoops. She proceeded to tell me I'd been eating too much sugar the past few days and I was ' going too far in the other direction.' I asked her WTF that means, and she said that I was just being a different type of unhealthy. i told her thats not a worry, and she said she decideds whags healthy or not.


Yesterday with my lunch I wanted a Nutella muffin, because that's a food I liked pre-ed. She didnt want to, but she let me. her reason was that id already had one of those little chocolates they put next to her coffee earlier.

I compiled a list of articles (divided into categories of A) sugar is necessary in early recovery, b) there's no such thing as a bad food and sugar isn't evil, C) HAES and D) gentle nutrition in late recovery ) and sent them to her. She got mad and told me that she makes the nutrition rules, not me, and if I can't listen to them then she'll call my old dietician to make me a ' healthy' meal plan. To give you an idea of what she thinks of as healthy, this morning she told me I can only have two sweets a day. I don't think she'll hold me to this (I won't let her LMAO ) , but regardless who says that to someone in recovery? In less than a week we went from me being unable to eat a peach for the calories and her getting angry at me for this to me begging her to buy me a small chocolate (which I didn't have at all for those most recent relapse months) and her telling me I'm too unhealthy.


She's holding me back. I had a massive sweet tooth pre-ed, so you can imagine how many sweets I'd eat now that I'm in a recovery period famous for craving '''unhealthy'''' food. Right now a typical sweets in a day looks like:
- cereal and a pastry thing as breakfast
- some snack of my choice after lunch which is usually where i get most of my sugar fix ( usually like a choco crepe or a small/medium muffin or a slice of like, a large biscuit covered in jam that acts like a cake . Google Italian crostata)
- an ice-cream at night if I'm still feeling hungry.


I always want more tho. i think if she restricts me any more than this i'll start eating in secret, which is gonna be really hard, especially with how much work i'm putting in rn (and one of my personal ed rules being that whenever i eat it has to be in front of my parents)

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Sorry because I kind of wrote a longer post than I intended, but I needed to get some things out..

I've been struggling with being overweight for as long as I can remember (28 now). I've tried some healthy ways to get myself to a healthy spot, but I just lost the weight, gained it back, lost a bit, and gained back more...  Now after the pandemic I'm at my heaviest I've ever been and it really does make me sad. I know that it's unhealthy and I want to get to a good spot again, but it's like I'm unable to.

I don't know if it's a food addiction or some form of BED or what. I often find myself eating more than what is normal (usually not healthy food), even though I have healthy options at home (since my intention was to eat healthy when I was in the supermarket). Or I get these cravings for certain foods and while I'm buying it I'm literally thinking don't do it: it's unhealthy, you'll gain more weight,... And STILL I do it WHILE I'm thinking it :(

It's not like I have these random moments where I suddenly would eat anything within reach, regardless of what it is. It's really craving and ""bingeing"" if you will on the unhealthy foods (either for dinner and/or something like chips or other snacks late at night). Then I get these periods where I try to be more strict because obviously just trying to buy and cook the healthy food isn't working since it's already at home. Then I start to register literally everything and all the calories that I eat and start restricting, which just feels unhealthy and obsessive too... Then after a few days or weeks of being strict with what I eat, I fall right back into the bad eating habits of eating too much and unhealthy... Like there's no in-between.

I've made an appointment with a therapist that I can see later this year because I feel like there is something wrong with me that I can't just eat healthily and normally, even though I know the risks of being overweight and I hate looking like I do as well... At the same time I sometimes think it's just me being lazy with no self-control and discipline and that there is nothing wrong with me except being addicted to junk food or something.  I worry that they won't be able to help me since it's me who needs to be strong enough to say no to myself and the urges....

I constantly get comments from my family as well saying that I need to do something, that it's not healthy,... as if I don't know that already.

It honestly makes me feel more ashamed of myself and my body than I already am and I just want to tell them to mind their own freaking business (as a side note, I have hirsutism which already destroyed my self-esteem).

I don't know, I just feel crappy about my eating behaviors and I don't know why I do it, how to be normal or to get myself healthy again and keep it that way. I'm worried that it's a life-long battle that I'm just gonna give up at some point because I don't want to constantly think about calories and weight day in-day out...",t2_rgi1pun1,False,,0,False,worried that I might have an eating disorder,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_woi855,False,dark,0.9,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1660515069.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry because I kind of wrote a longer post than I intended, but I needed to get some things out..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with being overweight for as long as I can remember (28 now). I&amp;#39;ve tried some healthy ways to get myself to a healthy spot, but I just lost the weight, gained it back, lost a bit, and gained back more...  Now after the pandemic I&amp;#39;m at my heaviest I&amp;#39;ve ever been and it really does make me sad. I know that it&amp;#39;s unhealthy and I want to get to a good spot again, but it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m unable to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a food addiction or some form of BED or what. I often find myself eating more than what is normal (usually not healthy food), even though I have healthy options at home (since my intention was to eat healthy when I was in the supermarket). Or I get these cravings for certain foods and while I&amp;#39;m buying it I&amp;#39;m literally thinking don&amp;#39;t do it: it&amp;#39;s unhealthy, you&amp;#39;ll gain more weight,... And STILL I do it WHILE I&amp;#39;m thinking it :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like I have these random moments where I suddenly would eat anything within reach, regardless of what it is. It&amp;#39;s really craving and &amp;quot;bingeing&amp;quot; if you will on the unhealthy foods (either for dinner and/or something like chips or other snacks late at night). Then I get these periods where I try to be more strict because obviously just trying to buy and cook the healthy food isn&amp;#39;t working since it&amp;#39;s already at home. Then I start to register literally everything and all the calories that I eat and start restricting, which just feels unhealthy and obsessive too... Then after a few days or weeks of being strict with what I eat, I fall right back into the bad eating habits of eating too much and unhealthy... Like there&amp;#39;s no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made an appointment with a therapist that I can see later this year because I feel like there is something wrong with me that I can&amp;#39;t just eat healthily and normally, even though I know the risks of being overweight and I hate looking like I do as well... At the same time I sometimes think it&amp;#39;s just me being lazy with no self-control and discipline and that there is nothing wrong with me except being addicted to junk food or something.  I worry that they won&amp;#39;t be able to help me since it&amp;#39;s me who needs to be strong enough to say no to myself and the urges....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly get comments from my family as well saying that I need to do something, that it&amp;#39;s not healthy,... as if I don&amp;#39;t know that already. My grandma even goes as far as comparing me to other overweight people and making comments. It honestly makes me feel more ashamed of myself and my body than I already am and I just want to tell them to mind their own freaking business (as a side note, I have hirsutism which already destroyed my self-esteem).&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"It's already the Morning of Day 7, but I realized that I haven't made a post specifically for Day 6 yet, though I did already post on here yesterday.

So. Yesterday was an amazing day. My ED, though still present, was so quiet. I mainly had healthy thoughts, I think.

I am starting to trust my body. 
I was mentally hungry after a small breakfast, so I had a second one and a morning snack after that. And after dinner, I realized I hadn't eaten a lot and that I definitely needed more if I want to gain weight. So I had more, which gave me a stomach ache. But I didn't feel bad about having a bloated stomach. I rested and let my body do its thing. It knows how to handle on its own.

And then it hit me: I am accepting weight gain.. Finally. Not only am I accepting it, I am actively working towards it. And if that means I can enjoy all the food I want, then hell yeah! Come at me, weight gain! 

I still have body dysmorphia, but it's not as strong as it used to be. I looked at my bloated stomach yesterday and I didn't see myself as huge. I was reminded that this is normal. 
Body dysmorphia is stronger when I look in the mirror. But when I see myself in pictures, I can recognize that I look sick. That must be how everyone else sees me. And no, I don't think it's pretty. It's sad. It's sad that I destroyed my body like this. 

I still have a lot of healing to do. While I am frustrated over how slowly I'm going, I've realized that it's all for a reason. 
When I first entered recovery, I only increased my intake by a bit and didn't tackle the mental side of things. It all felt so pointless. I almost wanted to give up, thinking there's no way I can recover.
I heard somewhere, that you first need to nourish yourself a bit in order to be able to make mental progress and only once you're starting to heal mentally, you can heal physically. It all goes hand in hand.

And honestly, I can see this in my progress.
I started by nourishing myself and by building new habits. Now that my brain has enough energy to function and now that I have a point of reference, I can process everything and think about what my goal is.

So I'd say my Day 6 being so good mentally was only possible because I gave my body and brain the energy to function properly. I noticed that I'm much happier on days I eat enough. ""Binges"" (though they aren't really binges) do set me back a bit, but I still keep going. When I wake up the day after having eaten a lot more than I usually would, I realize that I'm completely fine. And that's quite relieving and freeing.

Anyways, I hope today will be just as nice! My family and I will visit the indoor swimming pool we always used to visit when I was a kid. And I'm already so excited!

I started by nourishing myself and by building new habits. Now that my brain has enough energy to function and now that I have a point of reference, I can process everything and think about what my goal is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d say my Day 6 being so good mentally was only possible because I gave my body and brain the energy to function properly. I noticed that I&amp;#39;m much happier on days I eat enough. &amp;quot;Binges&amp;quot; (though they aren&amp;#39;t really binges) do set me back a bit, but I still keep going. When I wake up the day after having eaten a lot more than I usually would, I realize that I&amp;#39;m completely fine. And that&amp;#39;s quite relieving and freeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope today will be just as nice! My family and I will visit the indoor swimming pool we always used to visit when I was a kid. And I&amp;#39;m already so excited! I hope to eat some food that reminds me of the good old days, as well :)&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I've been in recovery for almost 4 years now, and have gotten a lot out of it-- the ability to feel joy, to think about things other than food, and honestly a lot of pride in having hauled myself out of a really deep pit. But I feel that my recovery plateaued at avoidance-- getting rid of mirrors might be a major step in early recovery, but I don't really want to live forever without being able to judge if my shirt matches my shoes. It sounds silly, but it sucks to feel like I have to avoid my recovery body in order not to get sucked into the old pit again.

I'm generally quite good about sticking to recovered behavior and my thought patterns aren't particularly plagued until I try to diverge from avoidant behaviors, and then I feel really awful until I go back to them. Generally speaking, I allow negative thoughts to exist as neutral things-- like bad neighbors, they're there, but it's my house. When I stop avoidance, they start banging on my ceiling, essentially, and it's much harder to cope with them. Avoidance and practiced neutrality has kept me healthy and was very helpful, but I can't help but want to move past it, because it doesn't feel like an end goal. I can't be playing tag with my reflection for the rest of my life!  

I suppose I'm looking for advice on becoming truly body positive, but really it's about how to outgrow survival mindset and move on to something more. Neutrality feels as much like a coping mechanism as anything else.  All the advice I see is for people in the early stages of recovery (and fair enough!

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this, so sorry if it's not. 

My girlfriend has had a really bad anorexia relapse (she struggled with eating problems in some way her whole life apparantly, but I don't think it has been that bad before) last autumn, then started recovering in spring. (Though I am aware now it was just Quasi-Recovery, she was eating at exactly maintenance and still obsess over that number instead of the lower one from before.) Now I fear she's back to restricting more. She gained a small amount of weight since recovering, and now believes she has to lose that weight again. She's not back to eating as little as she used to, but her first relapse also started her by losing a bit of weight though light restriction.

I feel completely helpless. We are long distance, so most of our talks are through text, which makes it even more difficult to show up - When we're together in person I just offer her a hug, have meals and snacks with her so she doesn't have to eat lone, or sit with here while she's feeling down, but it's so hard to help through text only. I just don't know what to say when she talks about how fat she is, or that she doesn't deserve to eat, or that shes ""out of control"" (for eating like... a 100cals over maintenance). Rational arguments don't work, obviously, and just saying that I feel sorry or that I'm here for here starts ringing hollow, to the point she sometimes gets upset over me just repeating these things over and over again (even though I mean them). She sometimes says she wants me to to convince her to eat, but when I try I just feel like we're pointlessly arguing, and when I don't have the capacities for it (because it does take a lot out of me, unfortunately) I feel saying no hurts her because she already feels like she's a burden on me. 

I just... Don't know what to do, or what she needs from me during this time. I've asked her, and she doesn't know.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TW: this is gross. Sorry

I used to purge a lot. For context. Can any ex-purgers tell me what your experience has been?

Deadass every single time I eat ANYTHING, I will regurgitate small amounts of it into my throat/mouth DOZENS of times over the course of several hours after eating. It feels just like a burp but there's no air. Just food that gets progressively more acidic as time passes, and it will become painful. 

Sometimes it happens to me on an empty stomach and I will have straight acid come into my mouth and burn me. It happened when I was laying down once and it got up onto my nose, eyes and ears. I cried because it burned so bad.

I'm assuming that my gastro-esophogeal sphincter is weakened because of repetitive purging over the course of several months. So it just can't keep the shit inside my stomach anymore, I guess. I don't know :( I had an ulcer from purging and I took medication for 3 months to heal it, so my stomach is really back to normal now. I just throw up in my mouth a million times a day. :/

Did I just ruin my body forever? Also, is this going to erode my esophogus over time and hurt me? Fuck.

&lt;p&gt;I used to purge a lot. For context. Can any ex-purgers tell me what your experience has been?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadass every single time I eat ANYTHING, I will regurgitate small amounts of it into my throat/mouth DOZENS of times over the course of several hours after eating. It feels just like a burp but there&amp;#39;s no air. Just food that gets progressively more acidic as time passes, and it will become painful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it happens to me on an empty stomach and I will have straight acid come into my mouth and burn me. It happened when I was laying down once and it got up onto my nose, eyes and ears. I cried because it burned so bad. &lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Uhm, major revelation? I have no I idea how this crossed my mind. But I was scrolling through posts about recovery and someone talked about eating over maintenance. Ever since I stopped tracking calories, I've had no reference of what my maintenance would be. I used to calculate it almost daily, but now that number doesn't matter, since I'm not trying to stay in it anyways. 

But from what I remember, that number was ridiculously low. It couldn't have been accurate. 

When I first started recovery, it was semi-recovery. I wasn't trying to get healthy. And I was too scared to go over that ridiculous maintenance number. Looking back at it, I can recognize how incredibly restrictive my diet was. 

Now I'm much more comfortable with a higher calorie intake. My disordered thoughts creep in at weird times, like when I eat more often in the day, when I eat larger amounts of ""unhealthy"" things or when I eat fear foods. But overall, I've come such a long way :)

My memory of the time before my ED is a bit blurry. But what I know for sure, is that I had no clue about my maintenance. I didn't even know what a calorie is. I just ate whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Did I gain weight? No. Of course my weight fluctuated, that's normal. I was a bit chubbier at one point and I wouldn't exactly want to go back to that body at the moment. But I felt so carefree. I had lots of issues, but food wasn't one of them. 

It all began when I joined in on lent (even though I'm not Christian, but it was trendy to join in at the time) by cutting out all sweets, snacks and junk food, as well as all drinks other than water. My goal was to get clearer skin. Though I wasn't happy with my body, so the secondary goal of weight loss was added soon after. And it all went downhill from there. I thought I was doing the right thing by restricting. It was how everyone around me and on social media lost weight. I just went down this spiral very quickly, it turned into an addiction.

I wish I never found out about calories. Why couldn't I just have stayed blissfully ignorant?

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Sorry for the long post.

I had disordered eating as a teen and got into a sort of semi recovery for the past few years - I had a few small relapses of b/p and restricting, and remained clinically uw the majority of the time, and kept my stupid food rules, but overall I wasn’t too bad. 

About a week ago, though, I relapsed, and this one is looking to be a full on, bad as the first time round relapse. Problem is, I live in a house full of people who have recovered from eating disorders.

Because i recognised that the only time I’d care about their mental health more than my ed would be early on, I told the remaining roommate what is happening (which obviously I now sorely regret lol) and they’re talking about accessing treatment now. But I don’t even know what treatment at this point would look like, or if I’d have to get back down to the dangerous point I was before, or at least have this going on for an extended period of time.

Edit: to make it clear cause I realise this post is a mess, what I mean by recovery is to stop this relapse and also stop the semi recovery, mini relapsed, and become physically and mentally healthy, which I can’t seem to do without any guidance because I don’t know what’s right and what is my ed brain telling me.",t2_8so78m6s,False,,0,False,Recently relapsed... do I need to relapse for a set amount of time before seeking treatment?,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wn7ugv,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Not in Recovery Yet,False,3,,False,False,self,1660374685.0,,[],{},,,True,,1660373475.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Are you guys sick of me yet? lol

So, I'm feeling really good today. Honestly, I think I feel better on days I don't give in to any restrictions and just have what I want. Today was one of those days.

Breakfast was my usual: cereal with a sandwich, this time with sourdough bread. It was quite filling and satisfying. At work, I had my coffee with a biscoff biscuit. I drink my coffee black, because I've learned to love the pure coffee flavor. Even if I wasn't scared of liquid calories, I'd still have it black. I do try to have cookies with my coffee though and it's amazing everytime.

Today I only had to work until 2:30, so I had lunch at home. And guess what? I FINALLY HAD A PAIN AU CHOCOLAT. I ended up not having one yesterday. But my mom brought fresh ones today and I had one, along with an apple. Sadly, it wasn't nearly as good as I remember, but I'm still glad I had it. Now I satisfied that craving. I had a slight stomach ache afterwards, though I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm not used to having pastry? Dunno..

Dinner was fish sticks with potatoes, cooked veggies and a little side salad. My mom gave me shit for not adding any dressing, but I genuinely don't really like salad dressing. Leave me be lmao

And for dessert, I had [this coconut-almond ice cream](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LN0R8EXxL._SL1476_.jpg) which I've been wanting to try for months now, but I've been too scared to challenge it. Until today. The white chocolate had coconut flakes and it was the best part. The ice cream itself wasn't that special, just vanilla ice cream with a slight touch of coconut. Still, I'm glad I had it. I could have had a lower calorie one, but i decided to listen to what I truly wanted. (The ice cream was okay, but [the chocolate bar](https://www.worldofsweets.de/out/pictures/master/product/2/raffaello-tafel-90g-no2-1027.jpg) and the original [praline](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tCwhvPbTL._SL1000_.jpg) are a 10/10. A must try for anyone who loves coconut)

Tomorrow I'm in charge of dinner and I plan on making ramen. It'll be simple, just a spiced up version of instant ramen by adding fresh veggies and maybe marinated eggs. I haven't eaten ramen in so long. It used to be my ultimate comfort food, but my ED turned it into one of my biggest fear foods for no reason. I kinda want to slap my ED in the face by adding chili oil or something, but that might be too big of a challenge for now.

And Sunday my family and I will go swimming at the pool we used to visit all the time when we were younger. And a part of every visit was to eat the trashy yet somehow comforting fast food they offered. That, or McDonalds. Fast food hits different when you go swimming and smell like chlorine lol

We haven't gone swimming in years. And I'm already so excited for it. It'll be a huge nostalgia kick. And to make the experience as nostalgic as possible, I want to have the trashy fast food. It's just part of the experience. I won't let my ED take that from me, nuh uh.

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;#39;m in charge of dinner and I plan on making ramen. It&amp;#39;ll be simple, just a spiced up version of instant ramen by adding fresh veggies and maybe marinated eggs. I haven&amp;#39;t eaten ramen in so long. It used to be my ultimate comfort food, but my ED turned it into one of my biggest fear foods for no reason. I kinda want to slap my ED in the face by adding chili oil or something, but that might be too big of a challenge for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Sunday my family and I will go swimming at the pool we used to visit all the time when we were younger. And a part of every visit was to eat the trashy yet somehow comforting fast food they offered. That, or McDonalds. Fast food hits different when you go swimming and smell like chlorine lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;#39;t gone swimming in years. And I&amp;#39;m already so excited for it. It&amp;#39;ll be a huge nostalgia kick. And to make the experience as nostalgic as possible, I want to have the trashy fast food. It&amp;#39;s just part of the experience. I won&amp;#39;t let my ED take that from me, nuh uh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your sign to eat something that reminds you of your childhood or of a happy memory. Food can make an already enjoyable experience even more memorable. I hope to create many more happy memories for myself :)&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TW: mentions of s*xual trauma, ED, poor commentary around body image, mental illness, mention of unaliving

Hey y’all 👋🏻 I just joined but I have a lot going on. I’m 31 &amp; a mother of two autistic girls &amp; I’ve been with my husband (their dad), who is also autistic, for 12 years now &amp; life is great. But it’s not. I have bipolar disorder &amp; GAD &amp; panic disorder &amp; I’m medicated for all the above. Sometimes I feel lonely, like the outsider in my household. I lost a bulk (no numbers!) of weight last year by restrictive eating &amp; it was a trauma response. Here I am a year later &amp; I *think* I may have an ED? But then again, I feel like there’s no way, I’m too *insert any derogatory body image adjective* to have an ED. If I did, I’d be UNDERweight &amp; not a “healthy” weight, which my BMI (I know, I know) says I am “healthy/normal.” There’s so many things I admittedly don’t know about ED. As a matter of fact, I thought there was only two until earlier today 🤯 I just don’t know what to do. As if maybe I’m teetering on something, or I’m already deep in the hole, or I’m overly dramatic as usual. 

This is a text I sent to my husband:

“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, about myself &amp; my problems &amp; my own self loathing &amp; hatred &amp; I think I’ve come to terms with with something, a sort of revelation that I’ve actually suspected for awhile but imagined it couldn’t be possible because of how I look. 

I don’t even know how to come out &amp; say it? But I’m almost positive that I have an eating disorder? 

I’ve thought this for awhile, but I also thought, “I can’t be f*t &amp; have an eating disorder.” But all I do is stress &amp; panic about food. Eating or not eating. Restricting my food &amp; calories for days, then eating copious amounts, sometimes even in secret, then barely eating the next day to compensate for what I did to myself the day before. Weighing myself constantly. Multiple times a day &amp; feeling so much self hatred whenever I’ve gained anything at all. But feeling empowered &amp; proud if I’ve lost anything. I’ve never told you this, but I’m going to, I’ll even use suppositories to make myself go to the bathroom before I weigh myself just so I can see a lower number on the scale.

When I was the biggest I ever was, &amp; you weren’t able to have sex with me, I figured it was because you weren’t attracted to me, because of my body. So, I started to lose weight &amp; then we were intimate again. But then I started (still do) having this all consuming fear of getting that size again. But then I didn’t wanna be the size I was…&amp; that’s never stopped. It’s all I think about. &amp; I do “good,” by restricting my calories &amp; food for a few days &amp; then I binge like crazy. I’ll eat two sandwiches &amp; three bags of chips &amp; a cookie &amp; a bowl of cereal, all within in ten minutes, not even taking a moment to fucking breathe. Then I’ll feel suicidal like I’m so fucking gross. 

&amp; this is why I have such a poor self image. This is why I absolutely hate myself &amp; hate what I see &amp; why I feel like you hate what you see. I think I have an eating disorder &amp; I need help because it’s spiraling”

I just don’t know. I’m so uneducated. Also, the intimacy with my husband that was mentioned was never because of my weight. *I* felt that way for years, so it caused me a lot of sexual trauma &amp; PTSD regarding sexual intimacy with him &amp; a ton of body image issues for myself. After years of that, it ended up being a physical thing for him in his neck, that has since been corrected by spine surgery. &amp; yet, my BRAIN won’t accept that reality. There’s years of trauma to undo &amp; it doesn’t happen over night. I just wanna mention that 🥲",t2_3j0oax5i,False,,0,False,Can anyone give me insight???,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wmnyg9,False,dark,0.9,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},ED Question,False,7,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1660317767.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: mentions of s*xual trauma, ED, poor commentary around body image, mental illness, mention of unaliving&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"For about two years, I’ve been keeping to around 115lbs (I’m female and just under 5’6”), through what I would say, a level of self-discipline (ie. better management of portions / ‘cleaner’ eating / calorie-counting and exercise - ie. 5-6 days a week). 

The last few months however, have been particularly difficult, I have been eating more/larger portions (and more unhealthily) and I have also been slacking off a bit with the exercise (3-4 times a week instead). My body also hasn’t been feeling that great with the excess eating - particularly highly processed foods, often leaving me bloated / uncomfortable. 

Recently at the end of each day, I’ve been telling myself - ‘it’s ok, tomorrow is a new day, I’ll do better and will eat less, I’ll eat healthier and will work out more’ - only to fall into the same routine again. 

I am feeling and looking ‘rounder’, and have since gained about 12lbs. I remember the satisfaction previously of fitting easily into a size 0-2 / XS, but now I either cannot fit into my size 0-2 clothes anymore or it’s tight. 

This is all making me feel down and I am getting thoughts of restricting my food / calorie intake. The other night, after eating over 2,500 calories that day, for the first time ever, I thought to myself, maybe I should purge. I’m glad I quickly came to my senses and didn’t go through with it, but these negative thoughts about my weight gain are worrying and I don’t want it to consume me.

i'm now just over a month out from a doctors visit where i was nearly hospitalized (they ended up agreeing to outpatient treatment as long as i follow the treatment plan which was 3 meals a day plus snacks supplements). both my parents were there at the appointment with me and heard this stuff. physically, it's been going well so far i do still struggle obviously but generally i feel a lot better overall (more energy, less nausea, less depression, etc)

but my main issue is that my mom has these really bad body image issues i guess and she keeps projecting them onto me. like she won't shut up. it's only been a few weeks and i still get bouts of dizziness and she's already telling me i'm getting too fat and i need to start exercising to ""make up for everything i'm eating"" and i need a flat stomach and on and on and on nitpicking everything. i'm still literally underweight because it's only been a few weeks and i'm struggling to figure out what amount of food i should be eating (because my idea of that was so skewed earlier) and i really don't know how to deal with this. she's kind of always been critical like this but she's just now started becoming this vocal about it. i could be peacefully eating lunch and she comes up to me and tells me to make sure i don't put on too much weight and that i shouldn't get fat.

i guess how do i deal with this? i genuinely want to recover but i feel like my mom is trying to give me an eating disorder and i've never been one of those people who could just do the ""in one ear out the other"" thing that everyone keeps telling me to do. moving out is also not an option at least for a few months. i've found myself internalizing some of what she's saying already and i really don't want to go there",t2_4ri9ft4c,False,,0,False,struggling with recovery,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wmfenp,False,light,1.0,,public,10,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,10,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1660290745.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;just as a disclaimer ig i don&amp;#39;t think i have an ed and i&amp;#39;ve never been diagnosed with one. i&amp;#39;m in recovery from severe malnutrition and one of the other subs i posted in said that y&amp;#39;all might have some good advice&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! I would love to hear about similar experiences to this and could really use some support. 

A little backstory: I've had an eating disorder for several years. I developed it at 19. At some point I gave recovery a shot and it didn't last long and I relapsed. For the next few years I'd go months or years deep in my ed but then interspersed by small bouts of trying to recover. 

Well, since 2020 I have been able to make my small recovery bouts longer and longer. Things were going very well in 2021 and I was in recovery for almost the entire year until winter. I relapsed in winter up until now. During this time I made friends with someone on Edtwt and we would write everyday about our eds. Not just the struggles but our current goals and things like that. Now we are friends on our personal Instagrams and other platforms.  

Fast forward to now: next month I am moving and between wanting to start my new life on the right foot and also feeling soo soooo incredibly drained by my Ed I really want to try my best to try to recover again. 

Here's my problem; I do feel triggered by my pro-ed friend. I really like her and am feeling guilty about wanting to end the friendship. 

""Why cut it off instead of just create boundaries over ed stuff and just be normal friends?"" you may ask. Well, she's really struggling with her Ed too and it's a big part of her life right now. It is always something we talk about even when we try not to.

We've also tried recovering together before and I do feel like right now I'd be very triggered if we did this again and she relapsed. It would trigger me to relapse I feel. She's not trying to recover now either. 

I think this is a journey I need to take on my own but I feel super guilty. I also feel like the friendship inherently reminds me of Ed topics a lot even when we do discuss other stuff. This is a big part of it actually - there's just a part of me that doesn't feel able to recover when we are friends. 

Has anyone else been in this position before? Please don't judge me for this.

i will say that this food apathy kind of goes both ways. i had lunch with a friend today and it was a decent meal - i had something called a “bilbao wrap” (idk if this is specific to the place i went to or if it’s a common term sorry) an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, and a chai tea latte (which even a week ago the idea of unknown liquid calories would have been daunting to me - so that’s a fear food challenged) at a mexican cafe and i wasn’t even thinking of the calories. i was thinking wow, this wrap is tasty, i like the pear and the cheese, i like this cookie, this latte is hot, etc. there was no sense of guilt about eating, i was enjoying my meal, chatting with my friend and her friend who works at the restaurant, and in general i had a really great time catching up with her. 

i just have such weird hunger signals. like i’ll be hungry as hell and than i won’t even be halfway to the kitchen before it dissipates. but i know i have a lot of mental hunger, but usually that just results in me thinking about food as like, a concept, as opposed to having a specific craving. or like, i’ll crave something, but it’ll be unattainable (like i’ll be hit with a craving for peanut butter when i’m out of the house and can’t have any, and than by the time i get home the craving is just gone) so i can’t really honour it. it would be nice just once to have a craving that i can honour on the spot. maybe i’m out and about too much for somebody who’s recovering (it probably wouldn’t kill me to do a bit less walking) but i just get bored being cooped up inside all the time, i like to get out and take photographs, and just explore the neighbourhood.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Guys, I finally had cake! Yay :) It was a piece of the plum cake my boss brought to work yesterday. Honestly, it was very underwhelming, but I wanted to try it. That, along with two cookies I had with my coffee, was my lunch. Breakfast was two sandwiches (one with honey, banana and cinnamon, the other with chicken cold cuts, cream cheese and lettuce).

And just now for dinner I had three pancakes with honey, cinnamon and blueberries. I'm very full right now, actually. My mom brought a pain au chocolat for me from the bakery she works at. It'll be stale tomorrow. I'm not hungry, nor am I really craving anything right now. But maybe I'll still eat it later? I'm not sure. After dinner, I thought I ate a lot today.

But, like yesterday, writing down everything I ate today makes me realize that it wasn't that much. It was all very calorie dense though. Which makes me feel like I've made some great process :) Instead of having lots of low calorie things today, I ate in a smaller volume, just with more calories. And it was a very sweet day lol the only savory thing I had was that second sandwich for my breakfast. I'm learning to embrace my sweet tooth again &lt;3

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Please delete if this isn't allowed but I needed to talk about this somewhere... also please don't read this unless you're firmly in recovery or recovered already because I don't want anyone to use it as an excuse. She's just one person and the only person I've spoken to who feels this way so please don't take it to heart 

Anyway I have this friend, let's call her T... we both met in an ED support group thing like 7 years ago now, and she had already been committed to recovering for 5 years prior to that. All of those years ago T had been my number one recovery idol, and I realise that it's important to focus on yourself but she was really inspirational to me. T had struggled with what wasn't yet called orthorexia for about 2 years in her late teens and although she wasn't physically ill and everyone was praising her for how healthy she was, the obsessions and compulsions were ruling her life. She got therapy and ditched all her food rules and seemed so happy and positive when I met her. 

Well recently, we met up for the first time since I started to take my own recovery seriously about a year ago. I'd gained a lot of weight but I thought out of everyone in the world she wouldn't judge me for it... she told me that when she first started recovery she was really really hungry and ate tonnes and tonnes every day (same as my experience rn) and was encouraged to keep eating and eating by everyone around her trusting that eventually it would stop if she didn't go back to restricting. She doubled her body weight over the course of a year and a half but even now 13 years later she says she's still constantly eating and is experiencing a bunch of health issues due to her weight. She then warned me to not go down the same route and that obesity is no better than starving yourself.... all to me, someone currently in the obese bmi range in active recovery. She said she regrets her recovery and wishes she had taken a slower path where she didn't ""become addicted to hyper palatable foods""

Needless to say I feel devastated.

She&amp;#39;s just one person and the only person I&amp;#39;ve spoken to who feels this way so please don&amp;#39;t take it to heart &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I have this friend, let&amp;#39;s call her T... we both met in an ED support group thing like 7 years ago now, and she had already been committed to recovering for 5 years prior to that. All of those years ago T had been my number one recovery idol, and I realise that it&amp;#39;s important to focus on yourself but she was really inspirational to me. T had struggled with what wasn&amp;#39;t yet called orthorexia for about 2 years in her late teens and although she wasn&amp;#39;t physically ill and everyone was praising her for how healthy she was, the obsessions and compulsions were ruling her life. She got therapy and ditched all her food rules and seemed so happy and positive when I met her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well recently, we met up for the first time since I started to take my own recovery seriously about a year ago. I&amp;#39;d gained a lot of weight but I thought out of everyone in the world she wouldn&amp;#39;t judge me for it... she told me that when she first started recovery she was really really hungry and ate tonnes and tonnes every day (same as my experience rn) and was encouraged to keep eating and eating by everyone around her trusting that eventually it would stop if she didn&amp;#39;t go back to restricting. She doubled her body weight over the course of a year and a half but even now 13 years later she says she&amp;#39;s still constantly eating and is experiencing a bunch of health issues due to her weight. She then warned me to not go down the same route and that obesity is no better than starving yourself.... all to me, someone currently in the obese bmi range in active recovery. She said she regrets her recovery and wishes she had taken a slower path where she didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;become addicted to hyper palatable foods&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I feel devastated. I told a friend about this to check if I&amp;#39;m the crazy one for being upset and she said she didn&amp;#39;t know how to tell me but she&amp;#39;s also getting worried by the fact I don&amp;#39;t seem to be stopping my weight gain.. I cried for an hour in the bathroom after that. I feel so hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"so my dumbass started faltering as early as 1.5 months into recovery. i had extreme mental hunger and gained weight very quickly (yes some of it was water but a lot was real weight) and it did slow down as i got closer to my set weight range. but i was appalled at how much i was eating and how much that i gained in a short amount of time that i really thought i screwed up recovery and just had bed. the fact that my eh was entirely mental did not help. my physical hunger cues were barely present until i was almost weight restored. it did and still makes me feel invalid. anyways looking back i was definitely still malnourished bc every time i tried to restrict i would immediately get so hungry i would be in physical pain and have low blood sugar. but i thought eating so much just screwed my body up or something idk. i got caught in a bad cycle of restricting, then realizing anorexia isn’t worth it, then when i decided to eat again it would be a relatively normal amount for a day or two, but then i’d have an inevitable binge that would scare me off into restriction again. there was a brief period where i was eating pretty normally and maintaining my pre ed weight for a couple weeks, but then i had a crazy “binge” week out of nowhere (this was when i got my period back) and i overshot as a result and i felt horrible about myself and went back to restricting and the cycle continued. if i could just accept the extra weight on my body and not freak out and immediately go back to restricting i could actually make progress. but i had preconceived ideas in my head that if i overshot then i failed recovery (which i now know is not true at all) but at this point i do not care about my weight. i just want be well. i would rather have overshoot weight than be trapped in the never ending binge/purge/restrict cycle. i never used to make myself throw up, but this week i’ve b/ped 3 times and i know it can’t go on any longer. as much as my brain tells me going back to anorexia will fix things i know it won’t, it’s literally what started all of these problems in the first place. i kept trying to rush recovery bc i wanted to be in a good place

and makes me want to rush recovery which just ends up making things worse. i would keep trying to go back to restriction bc it feels like a quick solution in the moment but ik long term it’s not sustainable. ik people are quick to say recovery binges are just extreme hunger but i really do think going back and forth in recovery has made me develop bed/bulimia tendencies. bc sometimes i will eat until satisfaction but i’ll be bloated and feel so guilty that i’ll purge and then it turns into a b/p session when i could’ve just sat with the discomfort of an extra few hundred calories and moved on with my life instead of binging on thousands upon thousands. i think at this point i need to get rid of all responsibilities and be 100% focused on my recovery. but i feel like such a clown.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Today started of well, but in went downhill a bit in the evening. 
Had my usual breakfast of cereal and a sandwich. I'm still not pouring myself a big bowl of cereal though. I keep sticking to a small bowl that I don't even fill up all the way.. But I'll get there!

Then, at work, my boss brought some cake to thank us for managing things while she was on vacation for three weeks. I wanted some, I was so busy that I couldn't take a break. And when I had to leave for school, I was in a hurry to catch the bus. But maybe I'll get to have some tomorrow, they probably didn't finish all of it.

Before school, I bought a protein pudding (I was very close to buying a regular one, but I chickened out ;-;) and a salad. And I used all of the dressing :) big moment for me. I had to eat both of it quickly before class. And a classmate commented on me eating by asking ""are you hungry?"" and I'm not sure how she meant it, but it made me feel bad... Still, I was doing fine. I wasn't bloated all day, which made me feel a lot more comfortable in my body.

Today I got to cook dinner since my mom had to work late. I threw together a pasta dish from leftovers, like mushrooms, beans and green peppers from our garden, garlic and some meat. It was good, but not very filling. 
I had a banana immediately afterwards and my physical hunger was satisfied. But then mental hunger kicked in. I was craving something sweet. 
I waited two hours, still craving something sweet. So I made myself another (small) bowl of cereal. Still craving something sweet. I had these taiyaki waffles with custard filling lying around. I decided to eat one. But it didn't satisfy me, so without giving myself any time to think about it, I ate the other two I had left as well. 

And then the guilt came creeping in. I feel like I lost control, like I binged. I tried exercising for a bit but quickly realized that I'm too tired. So I took a shower and now I'm in bed, trying to make myself feel better by writing about it. I'll go to bed after this. 

I'm trying to reason with myself. My other meals weren't that big, the snacks I had after dinner made up for it, right? All in all, it was a normal amount, right? Not too much, not too little... I know there is no ""too much"" in all in recovery. I should be eating more. After all, I haven't made much progress by sticking to the same things for months. I had to change something. And I'll just have to keep going. 

Today didn't end the way I wanted it to. But that's okay. There's always tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. I'm glad to still be here to see tomorrow.

&lt;p&gt;Then, at work, my boss brought some cake to thank us for managing things while she was on vacation for three weeks. I wanted some, I was so busy that I couldn&amp;#39;t take a break. And when I had to leave for school, I was in a hurry to catch the bus. But maybe I&amp;#39;ll get to have some tomorrow, they probably didn&amp;#39;t finish all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before school, I bought a protein pudding (I was very close to buying a regular one, but I chickened out ;-;) and a salad. And I used all of the dressing :) big moment for me. I had to eat both of it quickly before class. And a classmate commented on me eating by asking &amp;quot;are you hungry?&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m not sure how she meant it, but it made me feel bad... Still, I was doing fine. I wasn&amp;#39;t bloated all day, which made me feel a lot more comfortable in my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got to cook dinner since my mom had to work late. I threw together a pasta dish from leftovers, like mushrooms, beans and green peppers from our garden, garlic and some meat. It was good, but not very filling. 
I had a banana immediately afterwards and my physical hunger was satisfied. But then mental hunger kicked in. I was craving something sweet. 
I waited two hours, still craving something sweet. So I made myself another (small) bowl of cereal. Still craving something sweet. I had these taiyaki waffles with custard filling lying around. I decided to eat one. But it didn&amp;#39;t satisfy me, so without giving myself any time to think about it, I ate the other two I had left as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the guilt came creeping in. I feel like I lost control, like I binged. I tried exercising for a bit but quickly realized that I&amp;#39;m too tired. So I took a shower and now I&amp;#39;m in bed, trying to make myself feel better by writing about it. I&amp;#39;ll go to bed after this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to reason with myself. My other meals weren&amp;#39;t that big, the snacks I had after dinner made up for it, right? All in all, it was a normal amount, right? Not too much, not too little... I know there is no &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; in all in recovery. I should be eating more. After all, I haven&amp;#39;t made much progress by sticking to the same things for months. I had to change something. And I&amp;#39;ll just have to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today didn&amp;#39;t end the way I wanted it to. But that&amp;#39;s okay. There&amp;#39;s always tomorrow. I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it. I&amp;#39;m glad to still be here to see tomorrow. There will be no tomorrow if I go back to restricting. So I&amp;#39;ll fight. For more tomorrow&amp;#39;s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Imo EDs are a lot like being an alcoholic or drug user. You're always ""in recovery"" even if you haven't had a drink in 30+ years because there are inherent differences between yourself and a non-sufferer which you will always have to guard yourself against.

 For example an alcoholic will never be able to just binge drink on a random Saturday one time like maybe a normie can and continue with their lives without it impacting them whatsoever and having no ramifications. So someone in ED recovery, even if they've been recovered for decades will never be able to go on a normie crazy crash diet (which again isn't healthy for anyone, like binge drinking isn't, but the normie can bounce back and eat a bacon sandwich the day after and not care) they will never be able to engage in those behaviours without risking a relapse.

I have always found the standard of ""fully recovered"" to be REALLY discouraging and just another thing that would drive my perfectionism nuts. I see it all the time in this sub... People who still struggle with certain thoughts or behaviours despite trying really hard to recover, sometimes for years, coming for advice,  and simply being told along the lines of ""you aren't fully recovered. Try harder."" Which isn't helpful and makes even less sense under the view that recovery is a lifelong process.

okay so anyway this is just sm j was thinking about so I played around with a few numbers bc this is an unstructured rant but anywy i feel like humans can eat a lot more than we think while we're at our setpoint. 

it's just something that pops up in my mind whenever i hear someone say ""oh yeah, my maintenance is 2300! anything more and i'll gain."" it always seems so impossible to me that its that low? One day I calculated the calories of an average day pre-ed, and it was definitely at LEAST 3500 - 4000 a day. And guess what? My weight was stable (aka, stable for a growing child. ) even though I was growing,i am a girl and only lightly active, meaning I should've likely been eating less than that. using a couple TDEE calculators (which i wont even get started on which circle of inaccuracy hell they crawled out of,) my range shouldve been 1500 - 1650 per day based on a lightly active girl of 11yr old me's height and weight. at the 'professional athlete' exercise level they still said i shouldve been eating 2100-2400. if we take my 'lightly active' TDEE calculator average, i would need 1600 a day. even adding one THOUSAND calories to that bc the calculators are shit and never to be trusted, i was still overeating by 1000-1500 EVERY DAY. As someone who had (and still has) a massive sweet tooth, to anybody who this matters to (even during my Ana, macros never particularly bothered me) those were calories quite largely dedicated to carbs and fats. 
And guess what! I was at my set point range, so my body could handle perfectly well what I ate. My set point is considered healthy on the BMI scale, so to anyone who that matters to, I was exactly at the recommended weight for my height and age. However, my weight happening to naturally fall into a ""healthy"" BMI (which disclaimer should not be used as an accurate measurement, it is a dated system used by doctors because it is cheap and effortless, regardless of the fact it does mot provide an accurate reflection of health) range is almost entirely due to genetics, and im only mentioning it before someone comes along like nyeh i wont listen to you bc youre ""obese"" and you eat too much!! 

this isnt just me though. what sparked this post is seeing my favourite ed recovery tiktoker (@_thewellnessdiaries, i love her sm) make a video about how now that shes fully weight restored, shes noticed she can eat loads, and her body knows how to deal with it. she mentioned how the last few days she'd had a couple meals, that thanks to menu calories she knows were over 2000 calories.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Someone left a comment saying they're interested in my journey, so i might make this a daily thing :) It helps me sort out my thoughts as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So, today I woke up extremely bloated and hungry again. I had a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast, as well as some blueberries and a banana. But I was still hungry, at least mentally. So I ended up having my lunch, which consisted of a sandwich with cucumber, cream cheese and tomato + some cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers on the side, as well. Now here is where I made some progress:

Before going all in, I would have thought ""well, I already ate the lunch I made for work, so i won't poack anything else."" but today I stopped by a nearby bakery to get a bread roll before I got to work. I ate at lunch. And here comes another win: I had two cookies with my coffee at lunch. My coworkers keep bringing food to work (I know they're doing it for me) and I'm always tempted to have some, but never accept it. But I mustered up the courage to have those cookies :) After what ended up being an 11 hour shift, I got home and had dinner, which was BBQ again. I had chicken breast with cucumber salad and some baguette. It was a prepackaged cucumber salad and those kinds of salads used to be a big fear, but I'm slowly getting comfortable with them. We still have lots of baguette left, so I snacked on some while preparing my lunch for tomorrow. And I was craving ice cream, so i had some as well. Another win :) It was one of those ice cream sandwiches that are half waffle, half covered in chocolate. It used to be my favorite, but I started to fear it because of the calories. Today was my second time challenging it. I had been making compromises by having lower calorie ice creams, but not anymore. 

My bloating is still very intense and today I'm having a negative body image. I'm trying to figure out whether I had enough today or if I should eat something else. I'm satisfied for now. When I got something extra for lunch, I was fighting with myself. Thinking that I'm eating too much today. But having written all of it down, it doesn't sound like a lot. Hmm...

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I'll have work, then a break and then school (I'm a dentist's assistant in training and here in Germany you get training by work place experience and by going to a school specifically accustomed to your field of work). I have a long break to have enough time to get to school. I'm thinking about stopping by at a cafe to get some pastry or cake. To celebrate going all in. I hope I can muster up the courage. It'll be the first day after summer break and I'm starting my second year now. I'm a bit disappointed that I haven't made much progress over the past 6 weeks... But it can only go up from here!

I’ve been trying recovery for a while (many months, am weight restored). This week I have had digestive issues (gas, gas pains and severe. diarrhea), depression, and a cold that’s dulled my sense of smell—pretty much the perfect storm for having LITERALLY ZERO appetite. Also my period if that’s relevant. 

However, I had a driving lesson and a job interview today (one in morning one in afternoon) and thought I should fuel before each of them for my mind’s sake. Then I started to get worried about how completely joyless the food was and hoped to spark my appetite later with some of my favorite foods (sushi and peanut butter chocolate ice cream). The sushi tasted like CARDBOARD. Out of the three meals and ice cream I ate today, only the ice cream tasted remotely good. 

Now ED brain is kicking myself for not “taking advantage” of a day when it would be so easy to eat nothing and hoping that I have no appetite tomorrow either so I can eat nothing.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Could anyone offer advice on what to say/how to support my cousin with an ED? Is there anything you wish someone had said to help or get through to you? 

Background: We are in our early 20s. She’s suffered with OCD and ED traits for much of her life. It’s gone up and down. For the past year-ish things have really gone down hill. I won’t be graphic so as not to trigger, but her physical symptoms are very evident, she exercises compulsively, and isn’t herself (irritable, sensitive). Her mom and our aunts have tried to intervene, but to no avail yet. I don’t live in the area, but I see her at holidays and our families are close. 

I currently have a long text saved illustrating my own mental health struggles (which maybe she’ll find relatable and not so condescending/judgmental), that I’m scared for her, and that I’m proud of her for trying and that I love her. I’m wondering if there are specific things I should/shouldn’t say. My current text does not mention eating or exercise, just being happy. I figured that might make her less defensive. 

I’ve heard from family members that lately she’s said things like, “I know I should eat more, I want to get help.” So she’s at least rationally somewhat aware. But I know it goes beyond rational thought and isn’t that simple. I feel compelled to say something because I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t, but I’m not sure what. I don’t want to trigger or alienate her (although obviously I’m happy to have her upset with me if I thought it would spur her to get better).

Maybe I shouldn’t be so detailed in my message and should just be like, “thinking of you!” And that kind of thing? Resources online are really vague, like, “use I statements, be supportive”.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"My hunger cues went away a little over a month ago when I got Covid. Y'all had [helpful advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/w8uapy/struggling_to_get_back_on_track_after_covid/) about that which aligned with my RD's recommendation to go back to doing mechanical eating for a while until I'm used to eating throughout the day again. 

I met with my RD again to talk through this more, because I'm really struggling with feeling like I have permission to eat when I don't feel physical hunger in my stomach. When I was experiencing extreme hunger, I basically treated that as my permission to eat, and then when I got sick and my hunger cues faded, so did my permission. 

And as we talked about other ways your body sends hunger signals besides your stomach rumbling, it kind of forced me to realize and admit that I have completely refused to honor mental hunger throughout my entire recovery process. If I have a thought about food or a craving to taste something, I have thus far been ignoring it unless/until it lined up with feeling hunger in my stomach. 

I just don't understand how to go about this. I've always interpreted thoughts about food or taste cravings to be an emotional trigger, like that it's what you experience if you use food to cope with your feelings. But my RD says that's not true, and that those are signals that I need to eat. 

I just don't know how to feel okay with honoring cravings for something calorie-dense like a milkshake when I'm not feeling physically hungry. Last night I made one to try to honor it but I stopped after 2-3 sips because it just felt wrong to have it when I didn't feel like I was starving. It probably doesn't help that after wanting so many milkshakes throughout my extreme hunger period that I basically interpret a craving for them as ""your body is telling you to gain weight"" which is really upsetting. 

I was back at my pre-ED weight right before I got Covid, and then between that and the relapsing I've been struggling with ever since, my weight's been going back down and I've been interpreting it as my body telling me I could be done now and didn't need to weigh so much anymore. My RD says that's probably not true, but that I don't necessarily have to weight restore again if I can get back on track with eating enough and my weight stays the same.

I realize I'm doing a combination of overthinking, self-shaming, restricting, and using the size of my body to determine the valid criteria I have to meet in order to eat.

i started recovering from my ED (AN w/ purging) in November of 2020. I had been maintaining a low weight for my height for about 2 years after losing 80 lbs in less than a year (started keto, got addicted to exercise, started purging bc the anxiety of feeling pressured to break ketosis, morphed into extended fasting and low restriction up until almost a year after I graduated college). I haven’t purged since January of 2021 OR intentionally restricted. I’m overweight now and I’m okay with it, I would rather be OW than UW with health problems. I gained weight SO FAST at the beginning but the extreme hunger went away after about 6 months. 

the past year I’ve lost my appetite almost completely - I don’t crave anything anymore, I have a hard time enjoying food unless I’m with my fiancé. It feels like such a chore and I feel guilty as fuck for only eating once or twice a day if I’m not with my partner. I know doing OMAD can be healthy if you’re overweight, but mentally I feel like I’m flirting with a relapse. My ED behavior landed me it’s severe GERD after recovering and I can’t eat unless I take my meds an hour before. so many times I forget to take my meds and just say fuck it and give up on food because I don’t wanna risk having stomach pain and acid reflux. Without weed, eating feels impossible some days. 

here’s where it gets fun lol 😭 I actually prefer the way I look as a plus sized person and as a sex worker, my looks directly affect my income. A big draw for my subscribers is that I’m “bbw” (big beautiful woman lmaooo) but I’m having such a hard time keeping weight on. My fiancé is super into the way I look right now, and I’ve gained about 100 pounds since we first started dating. They reassured me that they are hella attracted to a wide range of bodies and that they’ll always be attracted to me even if I lose all the weight I gained. 

I’m scared if I start losing again I could relapse - I recovered before I met my fiancé and I don’t want them to ever see me sick like i was before. I do eventually wanna lose weight to have a healthy pregnancy after we get married  (maybe get down to high end of normal) but I have no idea how to go about it.

hey guys. im going to try and not mention anything that may be triggering, I just need to vent and hopefully receive some advice/words of comfort. 

i’ve struggled with an eating disorder for over a year now, and I was diagnosed with anorexia 5 months ago. I was recently in Paris, where for a month I guess I just let myself go and ate what I wanted. I told myself that I wouldn’t restrict myself and that all the walking would make it okay. I gained around 10 lbs. I got home, feeling fine, and excited for the rest of the summer. I spent a weekend with family where I ate A LOT. I feel very guilty about it. I weighed myself today and I am 4 lbs heavier. So here I am, so anxious and scared over the possibility that I got that much heavier in one weekend. I feel scared and unsafe. I feel like i’m in some sort of danger. I don’t fit into some of my clothes anymore, and it’s making me want to relapse. my thoughts won’t stop and it is genuinely torturous. I don’t want to ruin august for myself by worrying about food and I also don’t want to hate the way I look and feel awful. but at this point it’s too late. I wish I could be happy again. I got myself into such a mess developing this disorder that im so afraid i’ll never see the light at the end of the tunnel. I want to be comfortable with myself but the little girl who didn’t care about her large thighs is long gone. i’ve been overeating these past few days and I just feel like i’ve gained more weight than I should’ve.

&lt;p&gt;Basically right now people commenting on my weight is one of my biggest fears, I literally get anxious thinking about meeting people I know because I am so scared they will tell me I have gained weight. My grandma always comments on my weight and it makes me SO angry because every time I tell her to stop, she does it so casually and out of NOWHERE, and I react in an unnaturally angry way. And she acts like she did nothing wrong, just an &amp;quot;oops we are human we all slip sometimes&amp;quot; and it makes me even more angry. I honestly just want to either last out on whoever comments on my weight or hurt myself in a violent way. I know this is not normal in any shape or form but there isn&amp;#39;t really anything I can do about it. I just get angry at the idea of being perceived with weight, I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it. Please help because I know the weight comments will not stop as I recover further.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hello,
I posted in this sub around a week ago and shared my experience with an ED. In short, I have a super restricted diet due to health issues and also created these dumb restrictive tendencies in my head such as restricted feeding windows and just general food restriction. On top of this, I live a super active lifestyle (triathlon and weightlifting).  This led to a viscous cycle of binging and restricting followed by periods of over exercise and a generally bad relationship with food.

I finally decided that I was fed up and sought out the help of a registered dietician as well as opening up to my therapist and psychiatrist (I kept them out of the loop). The past week has been very eye opening. I have been eating fully unrestricted and I have cut down on exercise by like 75%. I have been avoiding the scale, but I know I’ve already gained a decent amount of weight which I’m personally okay with at this point. What’s really getting to me is what I perceive as extreme hunger. I don’t know if I should listen to the voice in my head telling me to eat everything because I feel like I’d literally eat all day. Also, I’m struggling to validate my extreme hunger because although I was slightly underweight I wasn’t anorexic or anything. I’d still eat A LOT of food on a daily basis because I had to supplement my training, but I still restricted a lot.

Should I really just keep listening to my brain and eat whatever I want and hope that this will eventually go away? My mental hunger is still very prevalent. I can be so physically full but my brain will say it’s not done. I guess I’m just having a hard time navigating this whole thing and would like to hear some others experience.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I was diagnosed with having disordered eating issues and body dysmorphia in the process of going back to therapy a couple years ago. It's so obvious now looking back, but I never realized that my sisters' severe anorexia and my seriously disordered eating habits stemmed so greatly from my mothers' own issues. 

This is a tale as old as time for mothers and daughters, I'm sure. 

At this point, I'd say I'm in a state of recovery. My relationship with my self-image is becoming more positive and I'm far less distressed and preoccupied by weight and food. 

My mother came to visit me a month ago and her disordered eating issues were extremely distressing to me. To some degree I have heightened awareness about her issues now, but I also believe they have worsened and I don't know how to deal with it. She's lost probably 30 pounds since I saw her for Christmas. 

Every moment of her five days with me revolved around food: if we weren't talking about near-future eating, we were talking about what she does or doesn't eat, the weight she's losing (""I lost two pounds after we came back from our vacation""), and how proud she is of the little she eats (""I realized I can eat half as many of the olives I like on my salad every day, I really don't need the calories""). 

It got so under my skin and was so triggering for me. It brought back so many feelings of resentment I experienced early in therapy when I was processing all the hurtful things my mom said to me growing up about my body, the fact that my disordered eating and self-harm cries for help went unnoticed by my parents because my sister had full-blown anorexia, how my binge eating in secret habit probably developed from being judged and shamed by my mom for eating, and how my obsession with diets is because of their presence on a pedestal in my home. 

I'm 28 and my parents aren't young. Our relationship was strained growing up and I want to improve my relationship with my parents so they don't die completely estranged from me.

I decided that while maybe not all in is for me, I am ready to put a stop to this madness. I broke down sobbing earlier today once again to my poor husband who reassured me there is nothing to apologize for and he’s proud of me for taking these hard steps. I am just letting myself feel all of these awful uncomfortable feelings and letting myself cry and be miserable and uncomfortable. We are both prepared for a lot of eating and crying in the coming months.

I’m so uncomfortable with letting myself eat and feeling extreme hunger, but I’m doing my best to lean into the discomfort. The disordered part of me had every intention of restricting today after last night and going for my long run this morning. Fortunately it was insanely too hot for my run today, so that forced me to rest and my hunger is very much extreme today so restriction was *not* happening. 

I ate my safe breakfast and could not ignore my blaring hunger cues so I ended up eating 2 chocolate bars and some mega stuffed Oreos (so good!). We had to leave for a gathering and I wasn’t hungry at this point so I didn’t eat at the gathering, but I no longer felt full so something possessed me to ask my husband to stop at McDonald’s on the way home.

Literally crying while laughing in the drive thru as I ordered a large fry, 2 cheeseburgers, 10 piece nugget with honey *and* honey mustard and a large frozen Coke. I honestly felt like I had been possessed. I didn’t think I even knew what I wanted until I started ordering.

My husband reassuringly squeezed my thigh and said I’m listening to my body and my body is HUNGRY as he urged me to eat one of my cheeseburgers on the way home. I’m so grateful that my husband has only ever said anything about my weight when I am on the lower end of healthy when expressing his concern for my health. I know he truly wants me to be healthy both mentally and physically and that is going to help fuel my recovery. I want to enjoy my marriage. I want to enjoy and live my life with my husband. I don’t want ED to be a third party in my marriage any longer. It has been for far too long.

I also unfollowed r/EDAnonymous and EDAnonymousmemes because I realize now it’s becoming a cesspool of people too deeply disordered and they just want to justify their disordered thoughts and behaviors and constant reassurance they can forever maintain a sick body and mind and that is NOT conducive to my recovery.

And the last win for the day was finding a couple of ED dietitians online covered by my insurance (one of which looks like a real person (not low end of healthy BMI recovered, just a normal person) which I think is what I need. As I said I’m not ready or feel like all in is compatible with me, but I am ready to start taking recovery seriously and working with an ED RD and coming up with a recovery meal plan that I can follow.

We usually eat three portions of food for lunch and dinner. However of late she's been eating only 2 half-sized portions. We usually eat together as a family, but she has been taking her food to her room/in front of the TV/eating after everyone's done or before we start our meals.

She doesn't avoid junk food, and has never mentioned calories. However whenever she does eat a snack she usually skips the next meal saying she's too full.

She never used to talk much about fatness or fat people, but lately she has been going on massive rants about them and how lazy and greedy they are. Like she genuinely feels SO ANGRY about them. She often also calls herself fat and makes a lot of self deprecating jokes about her weight even though she's very underweight.

She also started drinking a lot of coffee everyday. Its non-negotiable for her. And she told me enthusiastically that it helps with pooping better.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Tw because some things are explained in detail

I've been having a really dark time recently, very depressed and stopped confiding in others, and the guilt has come back. I feel guilty for every bite I eat. Yesterday night I had a big breakdown and planned a relapse for today. Woke up late, ate a big pasta lunch (which I will talk about later lol it was so good), spent the afternoon with a small snack and had a croissant later in the day, and the calories total came around... Very little, which is ironic considering how high cal the foods I ate was. I wanted to be done with that because I also had an argument with my mom today and was in a very sour mood. But idk for what reason it felt like a switch was pressed in my brain and I got like, really angry at my brain, I got up and made a pb&amp;j sandwich, texted my dad to get me some oats, yogurt and banana (comfort meal). Prior to that my mom asked what I'll eat for dinner, I lied and said I would decide even tho I didn't want to, but after my dad was back I made some yogurt-oat thing and ate it, later I got hungry again and ate more pb&amp;j and a lot of watermelon afterwards. 

I honestly didn't mean for this to become like a food log journal but I don't know how else to explain it, I weirdly didn't feel guilty for anything I ate after the croissant (even tho my stomach wasn't happy with all that watermelon.. but I was!) So I guess I am happy for that. I am flying to Korea in a few days and I cannot afford to relapse, who will eat all the instant noodle flavors and tteokbokki there if I relapse :((

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I've been wanting to go to Paris and found a very cheap weekend bus trip. My mom promised we'd go together this year.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"And it wasn’t even anything extreme. I had three large scoops of real ice cream from my favorite ice cream shop, 4 Oreos, and my leftover grilled chicken from the Mexican restaurant I barely touched, so totaling about 3,000 calories for the day. I feel like my body really did take over and I was glad it did. 

I realized I feel happy when I am eating. I feel like I can genuinely laugh again when I’m eating/after I eat. I feel *relief*. I don’t care about being alone while actually eating. It doesn’t feel like some sick ritual. I feel such profound relief. Restricting and constantly depriving my body of food is not easy. It’s insanely hard. It takes so much from me, including my ability to experience real joy. When I finally let myself really eat, life doesn’t feel empty. When I am restricting, I feel perpetually irritable and exhausted.

But the feelings I experience the next day are hard to shake and I end up right back where I started. The shame. The guilt. The self-hatred. The nonstop body checking. And for what? Because I ate? Why do I feel so disgusted with myself when my limbs feel a little larger? Why do I feel so disgusted and unworthy when I don’t feel tiny? When I can feel the weight of food in my body? Will that sensation ever not make my skin crawl? 

I struggled with Body Dysmorphic Disorder long before I developed a full blown eating disorder. I’ve always had these awful thoughts that are tied to my weight and the way I look. But I don’t know how to just let them go. I know deep down they no longer serve me. They never have. I am working hard these last few weeks to challenge myself and these thoughts. I’m sick of listening to this voice. 

I hate trying to recover in a world that is beyond *obsessed* with diet culture and fighting off literally any ounce of fat. Demonizing it. I am just so tired of people being praised for losing weight and people whispering how ‘he/she let themselves go’ when they gain weight. I’m just so tired of our thoughts being controlled by diet culture. It makes it feel like recovery is wrong.

Something I’ve realized is that many people I know, are actually much better off mentally and they don’t fit society’s toxic diet culture expectations. Virtually everyone I know in a smaller body is not healthy mentally or physically. Especially mentally. And those I know in larger bodies still exercise because they enjoy it and it’s not about weight loss and they eat/enjoy vegetables and fruit. What a concept! I just want to get to a point where I am truly happy in my body, where feeling and seeing excess fat doesn’t send me spiraling. Where I don’t feel like I need to wear jackets on hot summer days.

I’m trying to sit with the discomfort today. I &gt;!didn’t take laxatives last night to eliminate the food and water weight!&lt; so I guess that’s a small win. I’m fighting the urge to go for my run. I’m trying so hard.

Like, I'm looking forward to Halloween and autumn, I want to bake pumpkin pie and throw a Halloween sleepover with my friends. Then, for christmas season, I want to bake cookies once a week, I want to be excited every time I open another door of my advent calender. Then comes my birthday, on the 21st. My 21st birthday. It's my lucky birthday, right? I haven't properly celebrated my birthday in forever. And my 20th birthday was one of the most depressing days in my life. I didn't let myself enjoy it at all. So this year, I want to spoil myself. I'll bake a huge cake for myself and I will have a huge slice of it :) It'll be the cake younger me dreamed of. 

Christmas celebrations will follow soon after and I won't skim out on Christmas dinner with my family. 

And for New Year's Eve, I'll celebrate my choice to go into recovery. My choice to keep living.

What does scare me a bit is that I might have unrealistic expectations. What if it won't be as nice as I'm imagining? No one else around me makes a big deal out of holidays.

All those recovery influencers have amazing birthday celebrations. I guess I'm jealous... I want to have something nice for once. A day dedicated to myself. I'm starting to think, that maybe I too am deserving of having a nice day. First step to self love maybe?

It'll be a huge setback for me. It'll just reinforce the idea that I'm not important, that I'm not special and that everyone would be better off without me.

I remembered when I made that post that I was sobbing about my extreme hunger and absolutely fucking terrified of gaining. Yet I wanted to get better and damn, I got a lot better.  


I never thought I'd get this far in recovery. I went out and had bread, fries, and pie in one day and didn't panic or cry about it. I thought I'd be stuck in this bullshit til I dropped dead and I'm absolutely proud. Even when I had to man up and ditch my sick clothes, or when I dealt with extreme hunger four days straight and eating exclusively peanut butter, yogurt, bagels, and pizza. I didn't realize how far I came til now and how I was able to enjoy eating out. 

Honestly, I have been dealing with disordered eating, before anorexia got my ass. I wanted to lose weight at 15, so I started, you know, up chucking spiraled into exclusive restriction. By 18, I was sick, underweight, and controlled by anorexia. I almost died last year. Became so underweight, with an irregular heartbeat, I could barely walk. I tried to eat, experienced extreme hunger, and then developed anorexia, b/p edition. Ruined my life to the point that I had to move back with parents and again, ceased nutritional intake. At that point, I was told I either needed to go all in, or I was going to get hospitalized and tubed.   


No one ever tells you that recovery is hard. They always make it look easy. The media is bullshit, is the first thing I learned. ED recovery ""influencers"" tend to be liars, probably also restrict, and I advise all new recoverers to avoid social media entirely during their recovery. I relapsed a few times, but never long term and while I still have bad days, I'm doing better. I think about the life I missed out on. I didn't get to spend my last thanksgiving with my parents or my older brother before he moved because I was hyperfocused on the food. I stopped drawing for so long because of my shitty ed, that nearly killed me, and made me hate myself for years on end.  


Three years ago, if you would've told me that I would be able to eat pie, make smoothies whenever I felt like it, and eat peanut butter out of the jar (yes, I now love peanut butter. I've changed my mind. It's good shit.) I'd cry or think you're full of it. I feel so proud of myself. My anorexia likes to chime in and tell me that I was better off with it, that I'm awful, etc. but I know that it was never worth dying. To cry over going out.

I thought I&amp;#39;d be stuck in this bullshit til I dropped dead and I&amp;#39;m absolutely proud. Even when I had to man up and ditch my sick clothes, or when I dealt with extreme hunger four days straight and eating exclusively peanut butter, yogurt, bagels, and pizza. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how far I came til now and how I was able to enjoy eating out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have been dealing with disordered eating, before anorexia got my ass. I wanted to lose weight at 15, so I started, you know, up chucking spiraled into exclusive restriction. By 18, I was sick, underweight, and controlled by anorexia. I almost died last year. Became so underweight, with an irregular heartbeat, I could barely walk. I tried to eat, experienced extreme hunger, and then developed anorexia, b/p edition. Ruined my life to the point that I had to move back with parents and again, ceased nutritional intake. At that point, I was told I either needed to go all in, or I was going to get hospitalized and tubed.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever tells you that recovery is hard. They always make it look easy. The media is bullshit, is the first thing I learned. ED recovery &amp;quot;influencers&amp;quot; tend to be liars, probably also restrict, and I advise all new recoverers to avoid social media entirely during their recovery. I relapsed a few times, but never long term and while I still have bad days, I&amp;#39;m doing better. I think about the life I missed out on. I didn&amp;#39;t get to spend my last thanksgiving with my parents or my older brother before he moved because I was hyperfocused on the food. I stopped drawing for so long because of my shitty ed, that nearly killed me, and made me hate myself for years on end.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, if you would&amp;#39;ve told me that I would be able to eat pie, make smoothies whenever I felt like it, and eat peanut butter out of the jar (yes, I now love peanut butter. I&amp;#39;ve changed my mind. It&amp;#39;s good shit.) I&amp;#39;d cry or think you&amp;#39;re full of it. I feel so proud of myself. My anorexia likes to chime in and tell me that I was better off with it, that I&amp;#39;m awful, etc. but I know that it was never worth dying. To cry over going out. Life is too fucking short to measure your coffee creamer, or to not eat bread when out with your dad on his 68th birthday, to not have that pizza with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be happier. I promise. I have never felt so free and happy about life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday the 3rd, I met my nutritionist for the first time. I had my session and during it, she told me the reason I could not be weight restoring, is that I&amp;#39;m vaping so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to be honest, I&amp;#39;m really bummed out I have to stop. I stared vaping since November 2021, but I&amp;#39;ve used it to cope with all my anxiety. and now I feel like I have nothing to rely on. Ofc, I don&amp;#39;t have to and I could choose to continue, but some part of me knows it&amp;#39;s better for the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t cope with the eating disorder, and now vaping, this might sound so dumb, but I feel so alone and helpless for sure. I have to face everything. &lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Just a post to get out a thought I’ve never been able to share with anyone, but that screws with me regularly.

Since my most recent relapse that came to a head about a year ago (still trying to climb out of that), I realized I have such paradoxical feelings about lanugo. 

First, ever since I was a teenager, nearly 2 decades ago when all this started, I saw it as a badge of honor, because it was a physical sign that I was “succeeding” in my eating disorder. 

I also didn’t really have any interest in having a relationship at that point in time, so I wasn’t worried about how, quite frankly, disgusting it can be to other people. To me, it was just a disordered badge of honor.

Now, nearly 2 decades later, going through this as someone who has been married for over a decade, I look in the mirror and I see lanugo all over both sides of my face, neck, and throat area, and I am first and foremost disgusted. 

I can’t believe that my husband has to see me looking like this every day, and has for a year now. I can’t imagine having to pretend that you’re attracted to someone who literally has an extra coat of hair growing on their face, not to mention elsewhere on my body. 

I focus mainly on my face because that’s where I always see it when I look in the mirror, because I’m usually covering up the rest of my body. 

On the flipside, I’m really struggling with weight restoration and handling a changing body, or even accepting that weight gain is actually necessary. I know all the logical reasons it is necessary, and I’m not asking anyone here to convince me, because if I were able to be logical, I could tell you the same things that you would be able to tell me about exactly what it is, in fact, needed. 

Unfortunately, my brain doesn’t currently care, and my hatred of the lanugo on my face still isn’t enough for me to throw myself into embracing weight gain, which is the only way it will ever actually go away. 

There’s still a small sense of disordered accomplishment when I see it now, like there was nearly 2 decades ago, but by and large, the overwhelming feeling is shame, embarrassment, and disgust that even this is not enough to give me a kick in the ass hard enough to throw my all into this, because the fear is so fucking terrifying.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Tw: talk of fatphobia and should mention I am not yet in recovery. This is a vent.

I see copious posts like this in the Marriage and RelationshipAdvice subreddits. The OP *always* mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks ‘how to point out that their spouse has gained weight.’ They always make sure to include that their wife/sometimes husband looked “amazing and fit/like a supermodel” and was really into going to the gym/eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. But how should you point it out? Literally fucking don’t. 

I’m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn’t already have one. 

My abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight (I was always at a very healthy BMI) and compared my body to the bodies of other women. But he would constantly tell me how “perfect” I would be if I just lost ten pounds, putting me in the closer to UW category. Looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. He is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that I can’t shake a decade later. 

And the comments in these posts are LOADED with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like ‘suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together/getting a gym membership.’ ‘Maybe it’s a mental health issue/binge eating.’ And there are always even worse comments like, ‘you’re still young and haven’t been married long. You should get out while you can.’ ‘Your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their ✨helth✨.’ Fuck that.

People would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over FUCKING WEIGHT GAIN. Like, are you serious? I have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women NATURALLY look like supermodels. It is a full fucking time JOB to look anything remotely close to that. It is an illness. It is exhausting. 

And bodies are SUPPOSED to change. But how can I ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? I am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. In fact, he always finds me most attractive when I feel like I look like a hot mess (sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc.). He has never expected me to look a certain way/pressured me to be thin. But it’s terrifying. I am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which I do still struggle with.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"hi all, woke up this morning and realised I hit 1 year in recovery!

recovery has been weird, it’s like learning how to live life normally again. after 10 (!) years of being trapped in the eating disorder cycle, coming out of it feels like being reborn. been discovering some new interests — learnt that when my brain isn’t fried and malnourished, I actually really love doing word puzzles and sudoku. started reading books, doing pottery, and folding origami too! nowadays my drawings are happy and colourful again. 

started going out with friends and saying yes to things, even when there’s food involved. started trying new restaurants and dishes with ingredients i don’t even know the nutritional values for.  butter isn't scary anymore and neither is oil. nowadays i start to feel excited eating food again, which is something I would've never imagined saying. and MY GOD! the ENERGY I have! no more daily naps, no more fainting...I even feel like a nicer person. maybe it was just from being hangry.  

for the longest time I've only had my ed onto cling to for comfort. I was totally convinced I'd live and die anorexic, the disorder just swallowed me whole. nothing really changed until I accepted the fact that I deserved better than that. everything feels desolate and miserable when you live that way. even on your 'good days' you never really feel satisfied. it’s so unfulfilling and boring. I don't deserve to starve or be in pain - nobody does. 

I’m not going to sugarcoat how recovery is. when you’ve had extensive damage to your body, it will be gross. when you start to eat properly again, expect digestive problems. **it is all temporary and necessary.** if your organs must relearn how to digest food, it is not going to be a seamless process. but near the end of it, when you just stick to it, you will be able to curl up in bed at the end of the day satisfied. not hungry, dizzy, headachey, cold, or feeling your heart palpitate. to feel content and sleep well... recovering from AN has been a LOT physically and mentally, but the level of peace you feel is insane. 

no more obsession, no more brain fog, you can afford to worry about work and school and relationships and petty issues again. when you redevelop your life and personality outside your ed, you will feel fulfilled. you can and you will find passion and satisfaction in something other than losing weight. full recovery has been done by many and it will be done again.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I'm home alone right now. When I woke up, I made my usual bowl of cereal. I don't weigh it out anymore, I just do a free pour. But it never fills me up for too long.

Well, when I'm home alone, I have the tendency to look through the cupboards or cook something for myself, since I don't want to disturb anyone by being in the kitchen. And I love cooking.

Out of curiosity, I decided to replicate the bowl of cereal I had this morning and weigh it out. Turns out, I usually eat half the recommended serving size. And I've gotten so used to it, that it's enough for me, at least in the moment. But now I want to change that. The recommended serving size for cereal is already very small, but half of that? No wonder it doesn't fill me up.

So I decided, you know what, I'm gonna make myself another bowl of cereal. I emptied my favorite coffee granola without weighing it. It definitely was less than the recommended serving size. But since I already had half a serving an hour ago, it adds up to a normal portion.

Now that I know what an actual serving looks like, I'm gonna try to increase my portion. First step :)

Next step would be to increase my lunch from one bread roll to two. Depending on how many my mom brings from work, I might be able to challenge it today. But maybe I shouldn't get ahead of myself. One challenge a day is already great progress.

Also, I'm a bit curious. What's your guy's go-to breakfast? I used to fear cereal, but it's become my favorite way to start the day, especially since I'm a huge sweet tooth. In winter, I'd swap it out for porridge instead. I used to eat skyr and fruit for breakfast, and while I do still like it, it reminds me of my worst times.. I'm glad to have the freedom to eat cereal now :) One day, I want to do one of those ""eating like my childhood self"" challenges, but that would include A LOT of Nutella.

Last night I overheard my step-dad talking to my mom about me. He said, ""she eats too fucking much"" and said that someone needs to step in and tell me to stop. I haven't been able to go grocery shopping lately, and because of the extreme hunger, I go through groceries very fast. I've finished off two bags of rice, a jar of peanut butter, cupcakes, oats, quinoa, chicken, everything. I'm trying to save money and inflation is killing me. My mom basically stopped raising me when I was 14, I pay rent to her to live at home until I can afford an apartment. She sometimes lets me have leftovers or food she doesn't want anymore. My mom herself has disordered eating, as well as my step-dad. 

I've literally been eating their expired and spoiled food. He labels his food in the kitchen. He bought Cheerios in January and never ate them. I waited a few months and make 1 bowl, and the box is still there untouched, to paint a picture. 

My step-dad bought strawberry pastries about a month and a half ago and never ate them. I waited until two weeks after their expiration date and ate them to make sure he did not want them. As soon as I ate it, I woke up and heard him screaming about me being a ""human dumpster"" and eating all the food. My mom told me I just need to control myself and that I lack discipline. She said I'm eating because I'm bored and I need a hobby and to get out of the house.

Nobody in my family believes I have an eating disorder because I started off fat and got skinny. I don't understand how they could watch me starve for two years and act like it's insane for me to be hungry.

I've been in tears on and off all day. I just started to accept the idea of recovery and they're already making me feel dirty and wrong for trying to satisfy the hunger and balance my hormones again.

I did make myself eat dinner today. I decided to see my actual dad today and he said I looked sick, and asked me if I've been taking a multivitamin. He said my hair looked very thin. (I grew up with thick poofy hair. Its been shedding a lot more since my eating disorder started). He had me get dinner with him, and stopped at a gas station to get me cookies and a drink. He told me to eat whenever I'm hungry. ""You gotta eat even when you're sad, that's one thing you can't do, not eat."" He offered to get me cake but I declined because I actually (for once) enjoyed my dinner.

I want to commit to recovering and getting healthy again but I already know I'm going to get serious flack for eating again and gaining weight. My mom grew up fat, yo-yo dieting and starving herself. She ALWAYS comments on my body. My step-dad is just a misogynist and calls women fat and ugly all the time. Honoring my hunger is getting unaffordable and I'm not allowed to eat with my family because it's ""not my food.""

I know I have to keep going but I don't know what to do. Keep spending loads of money on food? Getting takeout in private? Why does eating feel so dirty, like nobody should see or know, not literally and not on my body? I hate having a human form!!!

,fuckeatingdisorders,"ever since i developed my eating disorder (and especially when i started to recover, specifically in the process of unlearning diet culture’s stereotypes and fatphobia) i had started noticing how normalized certain things are nowadays, despite being disordered or morally wrong. 

first off, fatphobia: the way people in larger bodies are shamed and deemed as inferior to those who are thinner, the way the word fat and being fat is seen as something bad (despite it being just a description word for the size of an individual’s body), and insult even, the amount of fatphobic jokes, and the crippling fear of gaining weight that many express. that’s not even half the list, but all of these things are incredibly common and all over the place. 

then we have diet culture: encouragement to under-eat and straight up restrict yourself to amounts that wouldn’t even be sustainable for children, demonization of carbohydrates, classification of food into categories such as “healthy” and “unhealthy”, promoting the idea that you need to justify and/or compensate for food, etc. 

what i’m trying to say is: first of all, the way all these things are ingrained into our minds through diet culture, fatphobic statements, and dumb myths is crazy. a lot of people (if not develop full-blown eating disorders) form plenty of disordered habits.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Tldr; what should I know about going to PHP? And can you get short term disability while in treatment?


So. I have been trying and failing to recover for a while now. Saying I’d start eating more at X point (but always pushing X point further once I reach it). Saying I’d gain weight by May, June, then July (here we are at August and I’ve hit a lw). *Promising* I want to recover but never being able to take the consistent steps needed for it. 

Finally I’ve accepted I need a HLOC and have *actually* taken steps to start one (instead of just saying I will). They recommended PHP and I will need to take a leave from my beloved job while I get help. Has anyone been successful at being approved for short term disability while at PHP? This seems so complicated to get my doctor to fill it out. 

I’ve done inpatient, resi, PHP, and IOP before but these were all over 10 years ago. I have no clue what to expect (aside from 2 snacks and lunch) or if I should bring anything.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I recently got back from a two-week long work trip to Spain. I'll admit that I was very worried about my eating habits and my weight while I was there: as you can imagine, my schedule was different and the foods that I typically eat were not always available. However, I went through the entire trip with my body remaining exactly the same (which I confirmed via measurements and the scale). This lack of change made me feel relieved as it pointed towards consistency, which is naturally comforting as opposed to any sort of rapid change in appearance. 

However, I noticed that the day leading up to my flight (and on the flight itself) I did not feel very well. On top of being exhausted (which I attributed to the current heat wave in Spain alongside jetlag), it seemed like I was beginning to develop the beginning symptoms of a cold. Besides that, I found myself ravenously hungry. As scary as it was, I just kept eating every time that hunger cropped up (which was about every hour or so) - even if it was foods that did not feel ""safe"" to me. I tried to justify this hunger by the changing time zones and my moving around the airports, but I still felt guilty, comparing what I ate on the flight to that of the people next to me.

I got tested upon arriving in the US (about two days ago) and it turns out that I have COVID-19, which I have never had before. Thankfully, my viral symptoms are fairly mild: I just have a very slight cough and some head congestion. However, my appetite has been absolutely horrifying. I always heard stories about people with COVID-19 losing their appetites, but it seems like all my body wants to do is eat from the crack of dawn to the very end of the evening - and not just eat, but eat the most caloric things that we have in the house. Yesterday I ate nearly an entire pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream in addition to foods like peanut butter, fried eggplant, and other snacks of that nature. Today I was hoping I would be able to get back on track and get some control over things, but I found myself making some edible cookie dough for myself (as I've been craving it for a while) in addition to things like scrambled egg on toast and some cheesecake. I'm still eating things like fruit, but that obviously doesn't counteract all of the other food. I am trying to set meal times for myself, but I just keep feeling hungry outside of them, too. 

My period also started yesterday and my body image is in shambles. I don't know how to describe it, but it looks and feels as if my entire body has been blown up with an air pump. My lower stomach in particular is protruding an absurd amount. I took my measurements and they are more or less the same, but &gt;!the scale read a whole two pounds heavier in only a day (ONE DAY!) of being home.!&lt; I am unfortunately expecting the same result for tomorrow. I just feel so guilty and stressed over this because I don't want to be eating this much food. I do not know why I am feeling THIS HUNGRY when I am barely being active at all. I am still trying to take one solitary walk a day and then do my regular workouts to get some movement in, but I'm of course not going about town like I would if I weren't quarantining. If I try not to eat, the hunger just gets worse and worse and I just wind up eating even MORE. I don't know if it counts as binging; I don't think so because I AM feeling hunger and stop once that hunger goes away, but it just keeps coming back more often than it usually does throughout the day. I just want it to stop and to get back to my regular eating habits that feel way less excessive. &gt;!I'm really scared about how much weight I'll keep putting on during this time.!&lt; I feel so abnormal, out of control, and just downright gross.",t2_czvtjdf2,False,,0,False,Eating out of control since catching COVID-19,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wfj99h,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Struggling,False,0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1659563697.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got back from a two-week long work trip to Spain.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"this post is mainly intended for u/Zealousideal-Top377, but i decided to make it into a post so others can see it, and cause it was so long haha. 

YOU WILL DEFINITELY DIE IF YOU DONT GAIN WEIGHT!!

i apologize if this post is triggering, but i have to say this. you have to recover NOW or you’ll die

when i decided fuck it and started recovering, I BASICALLY HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THAN DEATH! 

things i have suffered due to anorexia:

1- **MY TAILBONE CAME OUT OF MY BACK!** literally. this was basically what mainly pushed me to recovery. i was going downstairs at a hospital, was so tired i missed a step and fell onto my butt down each stair. idk why i passed out after and my mom had to carry me into the car. at home, my mom noticed a huge blood stain on the back of my shorts (i thought i got my period, how funny😹) and found out that my tailbone literally punctured through my skin. had that fixed but now i have a permanent scar in my asscrack👍

2- **MY GRANDMA WOULD CARRY ME INTO CARS/UP STAIRS/SIDEWALKS!** i literally reached a point where i could not walk for more than 5 mins without blacking out and my 70 YEAR OLD GRANDMA would help me do basic human functions like opening/closing my car door and helping me take a step up a sidewalk. 

3- **SEVERE BRAIN FOG/ MEMORY LOSS!** like i genuinely do not remember a single specific memory at the time i was malnourished, just general periods of time (this improves DRASTICALLY with recovery, a new world opens up!!) i also could not keep up a conversation for more than a couple mins as i would get so exhausted. 

4- **I HAD NO BLADDER CONTROL!** i literally don’t know why but i’ve pissed myself so many times while on the way to the bathroom, cause when my bladder was full it would literally empty itself on its own. (embarrassing) 

5- **BRUISES FROM SITTING/SLEEPING!** i reached a point where even laying down on a mattress would cause my ribs/bones to bruise and turn blue (ouch)

6- **DIGESTION PROBLEMS!** everyone says this but you either shit pure water for days (i would still refuse to eat starch to help💔) or not shit for a month, no in between. 

7-**EXTREMELY LOW HEART RATE!** my heart rate was in the low 30s even when i would walk and my parents would check up on me while sleeping since they were scared i would die in my sleep!

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Sorry for the bad English.

For some context, I've (ENBY, 18) been struggling with my relationship with food since being a young child, and recently my therapist has brought up to the conversation that I show some signs of ED. I also have been dealing with MDD and anxiety since childhood.  I feel like I'm kind of on edge. I always check calories and ingredients in food. I always think how I'm gonna organize eating based on 'will I go out?', 'what will be available to eat where I'm going?', 'how much I have eaten and what have I eaten?'. If I can avoid eating, I do it. I think to myself 'do I really need to eat right now or can I postpone it a little more?'. I lie about what I have or haven't eaten because 1) Some times I skip foods 2) I'm embarrased of saying out loud that I have eaten and discussing food, or saying food names out loud. I have signed up for many sports at the same time, ending up tired and overworked, and although I loved those sports, my main reason was to change my body. Some times, I get anxious and uncomfortable with the way I look and how clothes fit me. I can't see myself in pictures. I see old pictures and realized how distorted my perception of how I actually looked was, and I can't trust myself on knowing how I actually look right now. I feel overweight, disgusting, heavy and unatractve. I have avoided going places because I didn't like my body and how I looked. I have missed family reunions, parties, events. I recieve a lot of comments on my body from my family.

Combined to all this, one of my parents is a very frugal person and always taught that I should avoid spending money unless it's absolutely necessary. So, back to the title of this post, today at work I didn't bring anything to eat so by lunch time I went out to buy something to eat. I said to myself ""today I won't restrict, just eat a normal lunch like everybody else"". So I bought lunch and had half of it (I feel full) and now I feel guilty and embarrased and disgusting. I feel like I shouldn't have bought what I got, that I shouldn't have eaten and I feel like throwing up. I have never made myself throw up, but (specially lately) eating makes me nausceous and I feel like throwing up.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Feel free to remove this if it goes against any rules, but I thought I'd make a positive thread for once, that celebrates the improvements in quality of life that come hand in hand with weight gain.

As part of my recovery, I've ended up ""obese"" by bmi. However society sucks, and being ""obese"" actually isn't the worst thing in the history of the world ever. A lot of the time society literally behaves like being dead is preferable to not fitting its extremely narrow beauty constraints. However realising that thats bullshit, I also realised that there ARE real positive upsides to being in a larger body which aren't ever discussed about because of shaming and fatphobia in society.

-Cushioning for injuries. When I was at my lowest weight, I managed to fracture one of my ribs in my sleep by knocking my elbow into it... WTF. In a larger body, I'm not terrified of accidentally bumping into things, or opening a door or closing a cabinet with my side, and I know if I trip and fall on my face due to being clumsy AF I'll only be humiliated instead of actually hurt like I could have been before.

-Periods!!! I never got consistent periods at a low healthy bmi and need to be near the overweight range for them to be regular. Now I can predict when it'll hit almost to the hour every month...

-A digestive system that works. 

-Being much stronger! I can lift all sorts of heavy things without breaking a sweat. I used to be the type of person who asked other people to open water bottles for me, now people ask ME to open water bottles for them lol

-My hair is rich, glossy as thick. I have natural curls but they disappeared at my LW, now I have them again (and the energy to take care of them!)

-Bigger lap for my cat to lay on lol

-Never getting sick anymore. Someone could sneeze directly on me and my immune system won't break a sweat, when before I caught every cold, virus and fungal infection in a 3 mile radius.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I don’t get how I’m supposed to gain weight before fixing my body image.

I once posted somewhere on how disgusting I felt about my body because of recovery weight gain and some people said that I have to gain weight first and do the psychological work after that because apparently my brain is too starved for therapy. And I think it’s a widespread belief that you can’t work on your body dysmorphia before you start to eat more and I just don’t understand why exactly?Like yeah,my brain functions worse when I undereat but it’s not like I’m in a vegetative state or have lost my ability to think rationally. So long story short I relapsed.
My current therapist insists that I don’t restrict while we work on my ED but I literally can’t because the disordered thoughts which lead to restricting are not fixed yet.

&lt;p&gt;I once posted somewhere on how disgusting I felt about my body because of recovery weight gain and some people said that I have to gain weight first and do the psychological work after that because apparently my brain is too starved for therapy. And I think it’s a widespread belief that you can’t work on your body dysmorphia before you start to eat more and I just don’t understand why exactly?Like yeah,my brain functions worse when I undereat but it’s not like I’m in a vegetative state or have lost my ability to think rationally. So long story short I relapsed.
My current therapist insists that I don’t restrict while we work on my ED but I literally can’t because the disordered thoughts which lead to restricting are not fixed yet. And I know she can’t be all like &amp;quot;ofc feel free to starve yourself all you want it’s fine&amp;quot;.Idk it just feels like many people think there’s only one right way to recover and any deviation from it is disordered.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I developed anorexia at the start of 2020 and lost around half of my body weight. It was the first time in my life I was ever skinny, bordering on underweight. Then I started having binge episodes in response to my low weight. I had some health problems at the time from restricting so I understand why it happened.

It turned into a serious binge eating problem. I'm talking binges 5 days a week, upwards of 7,000 calories every binge. I felt feverish, tired, bloated all the time. I gained around &gt;!30 lbs!&lt; in 5 months. I was horrified and started restricting again. I've been in the binge/restrict cycle since March of this year and I can't take it anymore. I lost most of the weight I gained back but something in me broke and I just couldn't stand it anymore. I decided a month ago that I just want to eat normally again and not count calories. 

I've binged almost every day of this month since telling myself I need to stop counting and measuring. I still can't stop thinking about food and it's killing me to not fast in response. It's actually getting harder to restrict the more I binge eat. I know logically that I need to eat. I lost my period, clumps of my hair are falling out, I'm still tired. I'm a healthy weight for my height and I hate that my body is responding this way. Like you gained, why can't the symptoms just stop?

I know its only been a month but I can't see myself doing this for say, 5 or 6 more. I'd surpass my starting weight. I'm &gt;!15 lbs!&lt; off from being overweight again. 

Whenever I Google anything about this, or my worries about developing BED or something, everyone says ""it might seem like a binge to YOU, but you have an eating disorder so it's really not a binge."" I hate it!!! Is eating 6,000 calories in 5 hours not a binge? Is dissociating and eating until I'm physically ill not a binge? Or they say to let the binges go and my body will restore its hunger cues, accept the binges, or eat trigger foods as much as possible until I don't want them anymore. How can I restore hunger cues and eat all of the calorically dense foods I like? Even before my ED, I was the type of girl to always get seconds, always clear her plate, and always have room for dessert. I wasn't food driven but I always wanted the tastiest thing when it was time to eat, and for me it's calorie heavy food. Always has been.

I was never thin or even average before my eating disorder. I feel like it's easy to say that to someone if they've never faced the social consequence's of being a fat person, especially a fat woman. I don't know how to find advice or even a place for women who have been fat who developed eating disorders and got thin. It's so frustrating to see people who have never been fat to tell me not to worry about gaining weight, or seeing them stay thin after recovery and telling me everyone will be okay if I go all in and ""let my body restore itself."" 

I'm just tired of this. I'm trying to talk myself out of not binge eating today. I have friends who go to the gym and being around them anymore is so hard, and it has nothing to do with them, but the fact that they've found balance with food, are fit, are healthy, are happy. And I've never had that. I don't know if I can do recovery. I don't think I can maintain a healthy weight without my eating disorder, which means binging and starving, or getting back into my honeymoon phase and restriction indefinitely. No weight will be good to me. Exercise is ruined. Food is ruined. I hate having human needs. I'm so tired of counting, micromanaging my body, dealing with cravings, binge migraines, starving migraines. I don't even like being alive anymore. Every day is a problem, thinking about what I did to myself with my dieting turned ED and bursting into tears during binges. 

I'm in so much distress and all anyone can say is, ""well, you have to eat. Just find balance.""

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I am 31, and try and get back to spend a week with my parents ever summer. Man oh man, is it eye opening these days as to where my issues arose from. They both barely eat, and judge each other (and me!) constantly for their food choices. Some comments from my dad over the days I’ve been there 
“Have you got enough there?!” 
“You aren’t going to eat all that are you?!” 
“What… you’ve eaten all that ALREADY?!” 

Etc etc.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi all,
My history with food, body image, and exercise is complicated to say the least. Without going into too much detail, over the past year/ year and a half I have been struggling with restricting/ binging, periods of over exercise, and I think I’ve been experiencing extreme hunger all along and not feeding it.

My struggles with this really started a year and a half ago when I was experiencing severe GI issues (some of which I still have) and was put on a super restricted diet. I later found out that I have a bunch of allergies/ intolerances as well (allergic to 6/8 main allergens). So, my diet was inherently restricted due to my GI symptoms and allergies. Along side of this I fasted and or had time restricted feeding windows in an attempt to help with my GI distress. On top of all of this I am EXTREMELY active. Over 20,000 steps a day at work, plus running/cycling 5-6 days a week, and 2-3 days of strength training per week. 

Everything compounded and led my body to be in a imbalanced state for a very long time. My restriction and then inevitable binges have gotten so out of control recently I realized that I really need help. One thing that was really messing me up was restricted feeding windows. I would only allow myself to eat at meal times. Absolutely no snacking in between. Even if I had finished a long hard workout I would still wait until meal time to eat most of the time. 

I have a therapist and we’ve discussed the basics of my eating disorder, but I have still been struggling a lot in silence.

I took it upon myself to meet with an Ed centric Dietician last week and she prescribed that I eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. The snacking was new to me as I only allowed myself to eat at meal times. Snacking has been difficult because my body is so used to only getting food at certain times, it keeps telling me to eat more.

Now with the context set, I’m struggling to differentiate a binge vs extreme hunger. I guess with binges they are either a result of restriction or some kind of emotional problem Im trying to cope with food. My mental hunger is through the roof at all times. I was quite literally always thinking about food. Is “giving in” to the mental hunger and eating a lot of food all at once a binge or extreme hunger? I struggle to stop eating whenever I start and that’s why I started restricting so much. 

Another thing I need to address is my activity levels. I’m currently training for a triathlon so my daily needs are higher than most. I need some form of exercise   in my life but I am considering pulling back on this for now until I get healthy.

My question is should I listen to this mental hunger and eat 100% unrestricted in the hopes that my hunger/fullness cues return? I really need to get a grip on this.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read it.

I struggled with an eating disorder for about two years; pretty under weight, dangerously low heart rate, near hospitalization.

I have IBS and my stomach *has* been upset that last day or two, so that might be part of it, but I can’t shake this fear that I’ve failed myself somehow (even though logically I know there’s nothing wrong with gaining weight or looking any type of way). I don’t want to hide out in my usual comfy clothes because it’s hot af outside and I don’t want to reinforce the idea that I have to ‘hide’ my body, but I’m also terrified of wearing clothes that show off everything I’m insecure about right now. I’m terrified of what people will think of me, especially my family for some reason because I’ve always been the ‘small’ one. 

I haven’t yet worked up the courage to talk to anyone in my real life about this disorder, so I’ve been attempting recovery on my own for 2-3 months now.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"One year ago, I accepted the fact that I had a problem. I was miserable, cold and tired. One year ago I decided that I could no longer live like this, that I needed help. It took another few month until I got a therapist and really started this journey, but I never expected it to last that long.

I thought that the things, about malnourishment and brain capacity, did not apply to me, because I was aware that I had a problem, because I could (kinda) do my uni work and talk to people. That it would be over in what 2-3 weeks and everything would be back to normal, after this 1 1/2 year.

Fast forward a few month into quasi-recovery and the game of gaining a bit maintaining, and than gaining a bit more, took me just barely into a “healthy” weight again. Being stuck in a binge-restrict cycle.

The last 2 weeks however my body was tired of fighting for so long and decided that it no longer wanted to play the game of the ED voice. So I ate and no matter how much the voice mentally begged  to restrict, I was just incapable of doing it. 

Now I am no longer malnourished and yeah it turns out (again) science is right. The malnourished brain is indeed not capable of realising a lot of things. It indeed is necessary to gain the weight.

It feels like a curtain has been lifted from my brain, ever since I reached the “medical-not-longer-malnourished” phase of fuelling my body adequately every day. 
I feel so much more like myself it’s crazy. I can laugh and mean it. I get more emotional and I swear the world seems even a bit more colourful. I am no longer in this weird floaty state which is hard to describe and I did not even knew I was in. 

But also I had another realisation. Another thing that I thought I already knew, but suddenly really sunk in to me.

 EDs just fill out a space in your brain that was previously preoccupied, by another problem and as soon as the ED starts to get smaller the space is open for the problems to re-enter again . But it is also the moment that we could start to rewire. Instead of letting the dark material fill the void, it could be filled with so much more bright thoughts and love. It does not have to end up the same. It could be the start of something new.

But ultimately it’s you that has to make that decision. To take on the driver seat. No one else can do it. It’s hard. It’s against everything that you know. But “nothing changes if nothing changes.”

Today I ate breakfast after having one of the worst mental hunger eating “binges” in the middle of the night, after a week of eating way way past calorie minimums and I am terrified and proud and every emotion that you can think of, but I try to clench my fists and look forward.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’ve been in recovery for about 6 weeks. As I’ve mentioned in other posts, my weight was never super low. I think I dipped under bmi 17 at times but generally hovered in the low 17s. Prior to that I naturally maintained a i of about 20. However, I maintained this low weight for about 7 years and as the years progressed I started to suffer from:

* heart rate all over the place. Sometimes below 30, sometimes above 180. 

* arthritis in my hands (is this even a symptom of anorexia? Genuine question)

* Rynauds

* having to pee constantly. Super stinky pee sometimes (gross but true). Mini accidents constantly and one time fully peed ON THE STREET. I’ve never been so afraid and mortified. This was my main reason to attempt recovery. 

*sudden weird hearing problems. Like being underwater at times 

* dizziness and being freezing a lot

So, I’ve currently gained about 12 pounds or so over these 6 weeks with a BMI of 18.2 but no doubt will continue to creep up.

Already I’m not cold, my Raynauds has disappeared and the arthritis symptoms are gone. My HR is still wonky, but improving. I’m still dizzy a lot. My hearing has been fine but it was a sporadic thing anyway. No longer have that peeing urgency at all. Hormones are going crazy-all the PMS stuff like sore breasts, bloating etc. it seems like this is an awfully quick turnaround. Could it be real? I will also add that I have lots of weird tingling in my arms and legs now and am getting muscle cramps constantly. I don’t normally pay that much attention to how I feel, just kind of power on through the day, but I’m trying to focus on things more to see the improvements and take true inventory on the damage I did.

Sorry for the long post. I’m just looking for feedback as to whether these symptoms are normal, etc.",t2_p37b383c,False,,0,False,How long for health issues to go away in recovery?

As I’ve mentioned in other posts, my weight was never super low. I think I dipped under bmi 17 at times but generally hovered in the low 17s. Prior to that I naturally maintained a i of about 20. However, I maintained this low weight for about 7 years and as the years progressed I started to suffer from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;heart rate all over the place. Sometimes below 30, sometimes above 180. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;arthritis in my hands (is this even a symptom of anorexia? Genuine question)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rynauds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;having to pee constantly. Super stinky pee sometimes (gross but true). Mini accidents constantly and one time fully peed ON THE STREET. I’ve never been so afraid and mortified. This was my main reason to attempt recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*sudden weird hearing problems. Like being underwater at times &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dizziness and being freezing a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve currently gained about 12 pounds or so over these 6 weeks with a BMI of 18.2 but no doubt will continue to creep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already I’m not cold, my Raynauds has disappeared and the arthritis symptoms are gone. My HR is still wonky, but improving. I’m still dizzy a lot.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi there. I developed a restrictive ED at the age of 19 (I’m a guy). I went to a very low weight got outpatient treatment, regained, but yo-yo’d up and down through exercise compulsion, dietary restriction and orthorexia ever since. 

I’m 32 now. I only recently came across this forum and have decided to go for an “all in” approach the last month or so. It really seems like the only viable option for me at this stage, as any half measures usually tend to backfire on me and I inevitably go back to restriction, etc. 

I’ve had extreme hunger fairly constantly and have put up some weight from my low baseline. I’m trying to come to terms with this and the probable overshoot that will occur. I do respond to the EH but still hold back from going up to the next gear completely. I would probably eat all day long constantly if I truly gave in to it. My intake is probably in the region of 4000-6000+ per day. 

What I’m suffering with mostly, however, is my digestion. All my adult life, which is pretty much ever since I developed anorexia/ed, I’ve had very slow digestion, bloating, etc. I’ve had to purposely fill my bladder to increase my intra-abdominal pressure to create the urge to pass a bowel movement. The natural rhythm has all but gone. I’ve had colonoscopies, etc and my gastro has concluded that my problem is purely functional. He just advised using a prokinetic (motegrity) and osmotic laxatives as necessary. This hasn’t worked unfortunately. 

I’ve used every kind of supplement you can think of. I still tinker with movicol/miralax, magnesium oxide or citrate in varying high doses with a variable schedule but I feel they only add to my bloating with little help to actually pass any movement. Stimulant laxatives like dulcolax work, but I’ve never really abused them for any prolonged period, as I know that will make my situation worse. 

Any dietary alterations don’t really make much of a difference- I’ve tried high fiber, no fiber, carnivore, etc. The only common denominator is that my intake has always been restricted.

I worry that this could be a chronic issue that may never resolve. What I’ve noticed recently though, with a little bit of insight that has come since going all in, is that I’ve been chronically stressed and anxious all day every day forever. It’s like I’ve been in fight or flight mode on a constant basis for years. It’s such a complex situation but maybe my digestive issues could be related to this high level of anxiety also? I was on an SSRI for years but stopped that some time back. It never made much of a difference to my stress, and now I’ve come across some account of SSRIs actually causing longterm bowel dysfunction. I don’t know what to believe at this stage, and don’t know what my next step should be. 

I’m hoping that with proper weight restoration, exposure to different foods in different situations, neural rewiring of all my compulsive exercise and movements, etc that things may improve.

But in the meantime, any tips on how to manage the discomfort and ensure a daily BM would be very much appreciated. The extreme hunger and eating over 5000 calories a day is a liberating experience but when you have very sluggish bowels it can make a bad situation worse….apologies for the rant!",t2_cfeu0prc,False,,0,False,Constipation problem (tw calories mentioned),[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wcj0ku,False,light,1.0,,public,25,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,25,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1659252425.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi All,

I am 33 years now and suffering from anorexia for more than 17 years now... so long that I really can't imagine a life without but im so sick and tired of this way of living. I have a good social life, a part time job and I actually love food and drinks. The thing is anorexia gives me control and a kind of '''safe'' feeling.  
But I know my life could be so much more than this; friends are getting serious relationships/buying houses together and having children! I'm surrounded by people who truly loves me. I want to date again, to find a man as well etc etc..

I already suffered from an ileus ( testine obstruction/failure) when I was 25 and did die almost. I spent 5 weeks in the ER because of medical complications such as kidney failure because of my bad body condition. Luckily, I recovered from this complication. But now, 8 years later I still am having my ed and doing the same thing all over again. I never reached a healthy weight since my 16th and currently having a BMI of 14, which for me is very low but when I compare to others, my ed tells me its ok. Family friends and medical support are very worries for me since they are telling me im very very thin and are suffering for so long, I really have to keep gaining and trying to recover.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’m not recovered in the slightest but lately I have been doing A LOT better and coming to terms with a lot of things.

Throughout my ED I never truly knew what to strive for. I am quite young but would find myself looking at my body from when I was 11-12 years old and desiring it so badly.

I’d also find myself idolising my body from a couple of years ago and wishing desperately to have it back.

Here’s the thing, I’m 16. I will never achieve that body because simply put I hadn’t hit puberty. 

I will never look as skinny and frail as I did in a shirt ever again because simply put I have double D tits now. You’re never going to look extremely skinny in a shirt because they’re there. 

I’m never going to look as frail as I did because I have hips now. With my hips I have fat around my midsection and I don’t think I can have one without the other.

I know it’s hard to say but I can’t keep wanting a body I had before puberty because I can’t reverse puberty to get it back.

I think this applies to many scenarios and with any set of age differences. If you are an adult you cannot get your teenage body back because you are not a teenager anymore.

I find myself coming to terms with this more as I distance myself from my ED and it almost makes me feel better.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi all,

TW: Talk about restriction

I just want to get some advice here. Some backstory; My two older sisters have histories with EDs that my parents are well aware of. I have silently struggled with a weird relationship with food/body image since my teens but haven't been very vocal about it. We grew up in a very diet-centric house, with my mom on WW constantly and not cooking us regular meals. We were often left to fend for ourselves or my parent's favorite word, ""graze."" In the past few years, I've noticed my parents (both in their late 60s) making more and more concerning comments about food. They'll make remarks about how much someone is eating, or tease one of us for eating breakfast ""when we're having dinner tonight"" (I'm not joking). Its something me and my sisters all joke about but I think it is actually starting to get to all of us. 

So I recently came down with Covid, as did my Dad. I called him today to check in and see how he was doing. After filling me in, he said something really disheartening. He said ""Well ONE good thing about it is I'm not eating."" I didn't say anything, just kind of went ""heh.."" and he said ""I think we all sometimes just eat when we don't really need to."" I was SO ANNOYED. What is the purpose of this comment? And this is coming from him who eats like one meal a day. I'm just feeling really annoyed and upset, and also trying not to internalize it.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So... today is Saturday, and I've eaten a good portion of breakfast granola, half a pizza for lunch, food at an Indian restaurant for dinner with a lassi (milkshake/smoothie-looking drink, which is scary because liquid calories), a large cup hot cocoa, and way too much chocolate/candy (I filled up a large mug/cup thing, probably got 400+ grams of chocolates in there; and I estimate I've eaten &gt;!\+5000 calories !&lt; today. I looked forward to everything I ate, and enjoyed it all. But that's all; my thoughts never went towards anything else. And despite feeling really stuffed, the classic mental hunger is still there: ""I could eat more, I kind of want more. Tomorrow I want to eat three X, and I want two servings of Y"". It's so frustrating, and sad, and scary.

Not to mention I've eaten so much this week, much more than everyone around me, or at least it feels like it. And tomorrow happens to be my birthday, and I'm going to a restaurant to eat a high calorie dinner for the third day in a row. I'm scared, and I know I want to eat so much and so many different things, and I expect I'll want a lot of cake for my birthday too. I think to myself ""I want to restrict again starting monday, new week new me"" but I know I already want to eat more than I ""should"", even though it's two days away. My fourth year in uni starts in a few weeks, and all I think about is food, meals, calories... what I want to eat, how much I want, exercise to ""justify"" the monstrous intake... and most devastating of all, looking at my stomach, which has indeed got actual fat on it these past couple of months (which scares me because fatphobia and fear of things like diabetes and ""future restriction for health reasons"" of course).

It's so damn exhausting, and I don't know what to do. Now I want to go to bed and wake up for breakfast? Endless, vicious cycle that I'm not brave enough to get out of; I am not tough enough to go ""all in"", not committed enough to stop compulsive exercise, not confident or motivated enough to find myself outside my ED. It's so easy to tell others to just ""eat more and get better"", but doing it for myself? I've never found anything as difficult as this in my entire life.

And almost the worst thing of all, which is genuinly not good for me, is that I have eaten so much ice cream, hot cocoa, chocolate, cheese, cream etc. which contains so much saturated fat.

&lt;p&gt;so I never know what to have except the crackers and banana. it&amp;#39;s been easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but now , I started thinking about how it&amp;#39;s unhealthy. how it will make me overweight. or if its the main reason I&amp;#39;ll gain weight. I even made the mistake of looking up it eating too much pb crackers is bad. and you guys can guess the rest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate this.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"A light bit of backstory. My mother has been staying with me in my apartment because she has intense addiction issues and being alone makes her use even more. She sleeps in my living room and explains she is only here because she can’t be alone, and I tried to tell her to go home because she is highly abusive (I won’t go into too many details) but she guilt tripped me and said if she goes back on heroine and overdoses and dies it would be my fault because I abandoned her. 

Today after a few days of restriction, I went into the kitchen and ate the thin end piece of a bread loaf. While I was eating it, my mother screamed at me “wow you’re eating again? Seriously?”, (even though it was the first time I ate in days and she KNOWS this). She basically said I was fat and shouldn’t be eating, and then she gave me the most disgusted look at my body. She knows I have an ED. She knows I literally had an intake assessment with an ED psychiatrist for inpatient treatment this morning (which went awful). She knows I have nearly died from my ED, and about all of my ED related emergency room visits. 

I asked her to stop commenting on what I eat/when I eat/how much I eat, and she screamed at me “here you go with your attitude again”. She literally had just called me fat, gave me a disgusted look, and said I ate too much. A thin piece of bread after days of restriction and I deserve to be punished. She knows I don’t eat and that I am anorexic. 

I just don’t know what to do. I took a lot of benzos and mixed them with a lot of opiates to calm the fuck down, but I did this twice today so I’m not sure how much I’ve taken at this point.

She wants me to die. Its not the first time shes blatantly told me or implied that she wanted me to die. One of my suicide attempts landed me in the hospital, and because I was a minor at the time she had to come. When she was there, she was high on heroine and looked at me with evil in her eyes and said “you should have tried harder so you died”. 

Now, she’s playing with my ED in the worst ways. I’m trying so hard to recover (with so many barriers in the way), though I had a plan to fast for over a week. Now I’m going to do it. I was going to purge the bread but she knows I purge  and belittles me and calls me a disgusting idiot when I do. 

I just feel so much more disgusting than I already did. My body dysmorphia is horrendous, and she just solidified my perception of my body. 

How am I supposed to deal with this? I’ve dealt with it my whole life, she has always put me down, but my heart is too big and I wouldn’t be able to live with the consequences. I tried to kick her out and she said I was the reason shes going to die, so I took it back and don’t know how to make her leave.

im sorry for the long vent :(

so i decided to recover from severe anorexia by going all in almost a year ago (8 months i think) due to being super underweight and had no choice. 

i was doing very well eating my meals and following my extreme/mental hunger, and eating WAY above 5k cals everyday. 

recently my appetite has gone down a bit and i have noticed myself eating less some days, and binging so bad some other days to the point i feel so so sick. 
this usually happens when i eat and i feel like i “screwed up” so i keep on stuffing myself despite the fact i am full and repulsed by food.

Anyway, 2.5 years ago, when the pandemic began, I started working out and eating better. I was definitely not restricting, just trying to eat more vegetables and moving my body. I slowly dropped some weight, not intentionally, but still I was happy about it bc in this fucked up society being skinny=happy+pretty. Then I spiralled into restriction and over exercise, probably bc I was in a really bad place, suffering anxiety and dealing with poverty. The thing is, what does weight restored means? Does it mean gaining all the weight back? Since I started exercising and losing some weight or since I started restricting? Do you feel any different (physically and mentally) when weight restored? Do we have to weight ourselves to know if we're weight restored?

Yesterday I went and bought a pair of paints that I tried on a few months ago and decided not to buy because they were way too big. Yesterday the were still a little big, but looked way better on me and there’s room for growth so I got them.&lt;/p&gt;

the problem is: i'm still on a meal plan, per my dietitian, and i have to completely change everything to accommodate the low-fiber diet in the days leading up to the procedures. beyond that, a couple days before they take place, i have to go on &gt;!a liquid diet!&lt;, and also &gt;!take laxatives!&lt; (which i haven't done in over a year, and abusing them used to be a huge behavior for me).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I think I was either weight-restored or really close to it about a month ago, and then I got Covid and everything went to hell. I couldn't eat very much while I was sick, and I know from doctor's appointments that my weight's gone down. I don't know how important that is at this stage of recovery for me - my RD says I'll gain it back if that's what my body needs and I'm getting enough to eat - but the way my hunger cues have been since Covid have left me feeling disoriented.

It's been a month since I had Covid and I still haven't been able to re-orient myself to eating properly. I'm going anywhere from 4-8 hours without eating during the day even though I have automatic snack reminders set up. I just don't feel physically hungry anymore until it's been so long and I'm starving. When I finally do eat, I'm driven to eat somewhat bigger meals and/or go for more calorie-dense foods than I think I would otherwise have wanted. But because I know it's been so long since I last ate I try to hold myself back so it's not completely overboard. I've only very rarely felt the out-of-control feeling associated with binging, but when I get to this point of going nearly half a day without eating, if I get the amount of food that *sounds* like enough or satisfying, I sometimes end up feeling uncomfortably full and I want to avoid that.

My RD wants me to go back to mechanical eating for a while but I just can't make myself eat when I don't feel hunger in my stomach. And the longer this goes on, the more I get the thought patterns that I gained too much in recovery and this is my body telling me I've been eating too much. I know gaining too much in recovery is not a real thing, but when you're in an objectively fat body, 99% of the people in spaces like this are much smaller than you, and your ED diagnosis starts with ""atypical,"" it's really easy to feel like the exception to the rule.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"No, it’s not binging or BED. No, it’s not happening because you eat sugar. No, it’s not caused by your hormones. No, it’s not a result of not eating “bAlAnCeD mEaLs.” The biological purpose of extreme hunger (scientifically referred to as *post-starvation hyperphagia*) is to restore the body’s optimal fat to fat free (muscle) mass ratio. You will continue to experience EH until your body has restored 100% fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 100% fat mass (**fun fact:** *this is also why we overshoot*). It has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or “swinging from one extreme to another”, and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a [percieved] famine both during and after.
 
I’m going to get real with y’all: the reason the shit I mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ED subs, is because y’all are afraid of gaining “too much” weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. **Spoiler**: there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. Whether you’re all-in or taking a slower approach, you can’t recover without eating a lot of food, period. You can’t starve your body for months/years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won’t gain weight, or only gain what you’re comfortable with while eating what you *think* is enough. You have an eating disorder—the entire problem is that *you do not know how to feed yourself*. And you certainly don’t know how to cope with triggering situations—if you did, you wouldn’t immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. So stop trying to find answers to excuse away your *real* hunger. The fact that you’re trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior.

Just food for thought (pun entirely intended). Thanks for coming to another episode of Sareeee48 Talks.

**Edit:** this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. That shit is hard. Recovery is hard. But the level of misinformation that I’ve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. Remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi. I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed.

I just turned 33 and I’m starting to relapse a bit, and it feels like the dumbest fucking thing in the world. I know it is.

I received 3 months of impatient care for anorexia back in 2006 after nearly dying. I relapsed a bit when I got home but eventually stopped with the extreme habits. Not sure I’ve actually ever fully…recovered though.

I’ve stayed preoccupied with food, at least more than the average person would. I still have weird food habits. I still avoid certain things. 

Recently, and for reasons I’m not entirely certain of, I started restricting a bit. I’ve lost some weight as a result. Not a concerning amount…but enough that my family has noticed. 

I don’t want to put them through hell again. I know better. 

Maybe all of this is my subconscious trying to cope with my age. Maybe it’s my way of trying to hold onto a bit of what once was. Either way, it’s really fucking stupid.

I need to actually ACTIVELY pursue recovery like I should’ve…sixteen years ago.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"well, okay, first of all, has anyone else ever heard this, or do i just not understand how to integrate information into my brain correctly? bc both can be true.

literally just saw a tiktok that was (completely non-ironically) like “if you heal your trauma, you’ll automatically have an hourglass figure!”, which sounds wild at first glance… but apparently not wild enough, bc I’ve also heard people say that IRL??? like, I’ve even had a *therapist* say that to me IRL????!

first of all, body shape shouldnt fucking matter, &amp; it’s kinda dehumanizing to break down the entire vast and beautiful scope of what human bodies can look like into “some people look like this inanimate object, &amp; others look like a different one”.

second of all, as bad as all that shit already is, I’d argue it’s also really bad to assign *moral value* to body shapes. maybe i’m biased bc I’m an extreme pear, so I’m not one of the good ones. but idk. 🤷🏼 all I’m saying is, if it wasn’t “impossible” for a man and “shameful” for a woman to look like me, I probably wouldn’t have an ED. 🙃

also, like… if i ever heal from my trauma, i’m still gonna look like this. i had repeated trauma of a specific type when I was 19; i was pear-shaped before, &amp; I continue to be pear-shaped now. my life wasn’t devoid of trauma before that, but that’s kinda the big one… &amp; I still look like this.

the goal of healing from trauma shouldn’t be weight loss, the goal of healing from trauma should be… literally healing from trauma. bc nobody deserves to be traumatized, &amp; that feeling isn’t good when it happens to you. i, as a human being, deserve to not have to put up with my trauma responses - everyone deserves better than what happens to their mind &amp; their body when they have PTSD or a similar disorder. why can’t we focus on that, instead of how my body carries weight?",t2_4ji3fpzj,False,,0,False,"can we (society, i mean 😅) get rid of the idea that losing weight is the only way to recover from trauma?",[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_w76nls,False,dark,0.91,,public,32,0,{},,44428cd0-73c2-11e4-ae23-12313b0e44c9,False,[],,False,False,,{},Rant,False,32,,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1658698626.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;well, okay, first of all, has anyone else ever heard this, or do i just not understand how to integrate information into my brain correctly? bc both can be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;literally just saw a tiktok that was (completely non-ironically) like “if you heal your trauma, you’ll automatically have an hourglass figure!”, which sounds wild at first glance… but apparently not wild enough, bc I’ve also heard people say that IRL??? like, I’ve even had a &lt;em&gt;therapist&lt;/em&gt; say that to me IRL????!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first of all, body shape shouldnt fucking matter, &amp;amp; it’s kinda dehumanizing to break down the entire vast and beautiful scope of what human bodies can look like into “some people look like this inanimate object, &amp;amp; others look like a different one”.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I just finished 6 sessions of therapeutic ketamine + 1 booster (plenty of posts in my history about it). My psychiatrist and dietitian, both ED specialists, recommended it to me after I seemed to hit a hard wall in recovery, in addition to medication not being as helpful for me despite trying over 10 different SSRIs in 20 years and lithium. The psychiatrist at the ketamine facility also agreed that it would be extremely beneficial, and his wife is actually an ED specialist so I do trust him.

I immediately found it very helpful. It gave me self-confidence, and the moments that I was under the influence allowed me to have some time away from my body. When I was done, I felt less burdened by my BDD, ED, and other obsessive thoughts (and comorobid mental illnesses). My husband noticed a profound and incredible change in myself. My therapist found I was more receptive to her suggestions for healing.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’ve been doing some trauma work the last six months and hoooo boy has it reactivated old restrictive eating issues from when I was a teen (20 yrs ago at this point). 

It feels distinctly different this time around…the first time was more akin to what I think of as the media portrayal - hating my body, comparing myself to celebs/looking at thinspo, skipping meals entirely, terrified of gaining weight, wanting to be ✨skinni✨. 

This time around it’s more….practical? But also bleak. I understand completely that this is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and that there’s no ending other than recovering myself, recovering with assistance, or doing my body severe physical harm. I see self-assessments where they ask about whether you’re terrified of gaining [small amount] of lbs and I’m really not. I don’t feel great when I gain but I expect it to go up and down. I don’t love my body, but I don’t hate it either. I have no naïveté or hope that this will end with me feeling happy with myself or having the “ideal” body type. Mostly I’m just controlled by the numbers and food-centered OCD thoughts/actions, but it is definitely impacting my quality of life and mental health.

Hoping to get some perspective on:

1. Have you ever told a therapist/psych about your issues while also explaining that you’re not ready to change anything yet, and if so how did it go?

2. Have you had periods of time where you feel possibly almost maybe ready to recover but don’t want to start yet? What tipped the scales over into pursuing recovery?

3. Do you see an ED therapist and if so what do you find helpful about it? Do they act as a “regular” therapist too or is it a food-specific add-on? I already see a regular and trauma therapist and adding on a 3rd feels like…a lifestyle 😂

4. Any books or media you’d recommend that helped you understand the how’s/why’s of it all, or helped you with harm reduction techniques?

I want to accept this even if I constantly feel like I‘m being lazy and yearn for my old disordered gym obsession. While in a realistic world I want to be medium fit, I‘m just not a sporty person.

It's not about losing or even maintaining weight at this point, it's just about doing 'enough' to the point where it's kind of obsessive.

I tried not exercising at the beginning of recovery for a while (around 2 weeks) but it made me miserable and I quickly started again.

I do sometimes exercise purely out of joy but most of the time it's feeling like I have to, and I always force myself to do at least one activity a day.

I know this isn't healthy because I always feel too tired, I get upset over it and it stops me from enjoying things I otherwise might (rollerblading, dancing etc.)

I just don't know what to do. I feel like I can't get out of this mindset because it's 'to meet the minimum I need each day'.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"hi all I've found this subreddit to be very helpful the past few days. it's a lot to read but I appreciate you a lot if you do. 

I'm 20. I have been struggling with anorexia-binge purge type for almost 6 years.

In October 2020, I was referred to a program at my hospital to get checkups on my eating disorder. i was I'm major denial about being sick or needing help. none of my symptoms stopped. In early 2021 there was some progress in my weight but symptoms were still there. This is possibly due to the fact that I had no therapist or full outpatient team because "" I was too busy"" like I said. 

I was constantly told I'd have to go to the hospital if I didn't stop and was recommend to go to php. I kept saying I was busy. And I still just didn't want help. 

When August 2021 came around, I got worse. I felt my energy decreaing quicker, work performance was bad, I didn't return to college. I got into a relationship in which I let my insecurities get in. My boyfriend wasn't fully aware of my situation or what even an eating disorder was, so a lot of things were said that I took to heart badly. 


In October I started calling PHP programs and also Residential programs for help, but was turned away because insurance. So I gave up. I quit my job in December, and decided to try and look for help again, but no luck. I thought I'd use the time off work to focus on recovery but I just kept getting sucked into the eating disorder more. 

Frequent doctor visits and seeing that I was declining in weight more, I grew happy. I found a therapist but I didn't seem to care. Until April 2022. I almost passed out in a public place. An ambulance came and my blood pressure was low. I spent 4 days in the ER. I realized something needed to change. That I didn't want to die but I also don't want to gain weight.

I stopped binging and purging slowly but I still felt sick due to not eating at all. In May, I was at my lowest and decided to go into the hospital for refeeding (as recommend by my doctor. I had called a residential place that had a admission date for me, but in the end didnt work because insurance. 

I ended up doing PHP from June 23rd up until a week ago, because I was told I needed a higher level of care, even though I know I've been eating my meals and not binging or purging. Turns out I'm still loosing weight even if I'm eating. 

I'm not sure what to do. I want to get better and I don't want my weight to continue to fall. I just want to be healthy. I've seen my doctor but he said to go to residential possibility, and hell see me in 2 weeks.

I am eating. I am doing my best. I know I need help and I'm looking for a new therapist and now a nutrionist. But I'm scared my weight won't go up for weight restoration.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"*I’m a college student who’s very worried about the intense hunger I’ve experienced since end of April*.

For context, I began going on a diet starting November of last year. I set a limit on calorie intake of around 1700 calories. At first, I could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. I started to have binging episodes once a week. There’s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2-3AM I would go there and buy candy and chips. Feeling guilty, I tried to eat very little the next day.

During winter break, I ate almost the same food items for breakfast (1650-1800) and then almost nothing else for the rest of the day. When school resumed, I tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. The foods I ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them.

Towards the end of march, I decided to end my terrible ‘dieting’ practices. I began eating as much as I wanted. But I soon noticed that I almost never felt full. No matter how much I ate for every meal and snack, I wanted to eat more. My constant hunger intensified in May, and ever since I would eat as much as two or three meals’ worth of food for each meal.

I’m writing because I’m concerned about my health; I eat so much that I continue to rapidly gain weight, and I’m worried this will eventually lead to obesity. I am nearing being overweight in the BMI range .

I feel like I didn’t restrict to an extreme degree while I was dieting. Consequently, I don’t understand why I’m experiencing such intense hunger for such a long time. My lab results also don’t indicate any underlying medical condition.

**TLDR: I didn’t heavily restrict while dieting, so my unending extreme hunger feels unjustified. I’m afraid of what will happen to me if this continues.**",t2_d5mba4ly,False,,0,False,Worried about possibly unjustified extreme hunger,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_w5s72d,False,dark,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1658542611.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m a college student who’s very worried about the intense hunger I’ve experienced since end of April&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, I began going on a diet starting November of last year. I set a limit on calorie intake of around 1700 calories. At first, I could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. I started to have binging episodes once a week. There’s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2-3AM I would go there and buy candy and chips. Feeling guilty, I tried to eat very little the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During winter break, I ate almost the same food items for breakfast (1650-1800) and then almost nothing else for the rest of the day. When school resumed, I tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. The foods I ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of march, I decided to end my terrible ‘dieting’ practices. I began eating as much as I wanted. But I soon noticed that I almost never felt full. No matter how much I ate for every meal and snack, I wanted to eat more. My constant hunger intensified in May, and ever since I would eat as much as two or three meals’ worth of food for each meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing because I’m concerned about my health; I eat so much that I continue to rapidly gain weight, and I’m worried this will eventually lead to obesity. I am nearing being overweight in the BMI range .&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"i've been trying self recovery for about a month, and i think i've been doing pretty well.  my extreme hunger was pretty intense the first week or two, but it's started mellowing out, now it just comes and goes.  there's only like a 33% chance it'll be an extreme hunger day now, rather than a 99% chance like it was in the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

before i started recovery, i would only get hungry a few times a day, be able to eat maybe at most half a portion of something, and still be uncomfortable after every bit of food.  since starting recovery, i've been hungry much more frequently, i've been able to up my portions noticeably (i can eat almost a full portion now, and i make up for what i can't eat in snacks and drinks), and discomfort is more like a coin-flip rather than a given.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm proud of my progress, and my partner's noticed and has said they're proud of me as well.  even though it's not really showing in my appearance yet, and i haven't weighted myself, i feel healthier.  by that i mean, i no longer feel like i'm going to have a heart attack or faint all day every day while living basically sedentary.

&amp;#x200B;

still though, i have days where my physical discomfort levels with eating feel the same as they did before recovery, and i have to force myself to eat through the discomfort.  as well, the smell of food will make me nauseous.  it feels like my stomach and my throat shrink, squeeze in and tense up.  especially on days like today, where extreme hunger is present, this is the absolute worst.  like my whole body is screaming at me to eat and eat and eat, but my stomach can barely handle a few bites of food.  i want to eat, but the discomfort makes it hard.

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone know how to cope with this?  should i listen to my stomach discomfort even though it will result in a low calorie day?  or should i honour the extreme hunger even though it'll make me feel physically uncomfortable and miserable?  i want to do well in recovery, especially after a really bad health scare.  the mentality is there, but some days the physical hardships make it feel like i'm going backwards.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi all - for background, I am in my early twenties and currently in IOP following an AN relapse. I’ve been at my current program for about six weeks and have made some really good progress, but I’ve also somewhat plateaued and am still engaging in a range of ED behaviors. My treatment team is recommending I spend a couple weeks at a HLOC as sort of a tune up/jump start as they feel discharging me with my current frequency using certain behaviors could be very risky. I am a student, and they’re concerned that without extra intervention I’ll backslide at the start of the school year.  

Me and my outpatient team were all somewhat surprised by this suggestion as I have generally been eating adequate amounts each day even with some restriction/compulsive exercise (for example, might restrict at a meal but overall intake for the day is good, or might make ED driven food choices but they still minimally meet my meal plan, or do some compulsive exercise but at low frequency/intensity). My outpatient team basically said this would be a somewhat unusual step up in treatment bc it wouldn’t be the result of me doing super badly in IOP but instead a sort of safeguard/method to get me doing even better and get out of this “stuck” zone. IOP team confirmed that I’m very compliant and engaged and that a some things are going well, they just see areas I’m still struggling and that they think would be good to improve. My OP team definitely hasn’t discouraged me from trying a HLOC but agreed with me that it might not be necessary and that this is ultimately my choice based on what I think will help me and whether I’m willing to engage with the process. I’m not opposed to trying a HLOC for a short period because I really truly want to recover, but I’m also concerned being at a HLOC will surround me with people who are much sicker in a way that will be really distressing or something.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"hello all, very nervous to be posting this, but i would really love some advice on this. 

i’ve had an eating disorder for fourish years now, and have been in php twice and tried (and failed) to go to residential once. none of this helped me recover at all, and i always ended up worse than i started. i have the opportunity to go to a residential in a few days, if i say yes. 

problem is, im terrified to my fucking core. i tried to go to residential before, and as stated, didn’t last two hours. i had a full breakdown and begged and cried for my mom to pick me up, and she did. this wasn’t because i didn’t want to recover, and not because i didn’t appreciate the help, but because i genuinely couldn’t handle anything about the way res is set up. i had severe separation anxiety as a kid and have autism, so these two things could be factors, although anxiety is generalized anxiety and not separation anxiety now. 

i want to recover, i really do. but i’ve had no luck with an outpatient team for the past year and im doing worse and worse. if i didn’t go, what do i do? how do i escape this hellish disorder? i really don’t think that i can ever mentally handle res, or even php anymore for that matter. i’ve never felt the kind of panic i do at even the mere mention of treatment. i lose all feeling in my body and hyperventilate for hours. i literally sobbed for 6 hours straight at php before i dropped out, with absolutely no breaks.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So over the last two years I(F) have focused a lot of energy on tackling my ED which I have had since 2016. It took a very long time for me to adjust my appetite and relationship to food and exercise (I used to exercise a crazy amount and passed out in a lot of dangerous situations because I wasn't eating enough before exercising). I had to quit the gym/outdoor workouts and focused only on yin yoga and meditation, which was a great idea and helped me clear up a lot of old injuries. Once I was able to stabilize myself I turned to focusing on eating more and consuming nutrient-dense high calorie meals and snacks. My body mass increased by 15% and most of it was fat because I was not doing muscle building or cardiovascular workouts. OMG the differences are insane! Changing my body on purpose in the opposite direction people usually go also opened my eyes to how dumb the average person (myself included) is when it comes to health and fitness.

1) People are shocked when they found out I intentionally gained weight and stopped exercising. At the risk of sharing my personal information or sounding bitter I usually steer the conversation in another direction, but it's ridiculous how judgemental a lot of people can be. They act like choosing to focus on gaining weight and resting are a moral failure. It's extra hilarious when they are condescending to me about fitness because I used to be a triathlete and a personal trainer. I can still do one handed pushups. Usually this attitude comes from men &amp; not women. It takes literally everything in me not to just drop down into a set of 1 handed pushups or contortion when these people try to lecture me about the importance of strengthening or whatever.

2) Coming out of the fog of fitness culture and doing what was right for me to get my health back on track so I wouldn't suddenly go into cardiac arrest from a brisk walk showed me how many fitness people are liars!! I used to be focused on my own workouts so never really cared or paid attention to the kinds of crap people said they did every week to stay fit (I also did some pretty extreme stuff so it didn't faze me if someone said they did something extremely unhealthy). So many times I would join a workout group &amp; people would tell me about how they never came later than 5 AM to train, but when I showed up at 5 AM no one would be there! Or when a guy told me he played basketball for 3 hours every morning but couldn't even do basic body weight exercises that anyone who works out for that long should be able to do. I don't mean to body shame or diminish someone's athletic ability but if you are blatantly lying about something you should be able to prove easily, that is laughable. It's also extremely dangerous to tell others that you can and regularly do such unhealthy things when you don't, because that normalizes extreme behavior! I feel terrible for people who have no education on fitness hearing from these jokers in the gym or on the court about their unrealistic regimens when the only extreme thing they really do is take steroids and spend $200 per month on supplements.

3) In terms of my happiness, having extra chub is WAY healthier than being underweight. I got back into the gym recently and I'm able to keep up with a lot of my old exercise routines from when I was actively anorexic. I have more energy now than ever and can do intense workouts for longer than I could when I was skinny. I'm actually afraid of losing too much weight now because having extra fat storage makes me feel so much more comfortable and my heart is definitely thanking me during cardio workouts!

4) People take my ideas more seriously now that I am not extremely thin and waifish. I don't know what that is, if it's my confidence or my appearance or both. I have a bachelor's degree in finance and am working on a graduate degree in statistics. I'm pretty smart, but before I took my health seriously (the real way, not the compulsive and constant shaming way) I had no confidence, which wasn't helped by my brain fog from poor diet! I used to be shy about myself and afraid of everyone. Even when I tried to project confidence, I was extremely nervous and insecure. I also got hit on a lot by really gross guys. I always felt like they weren't attracted to me or even my appearance so much as the idea of having a skinny blonde reciprocate their advances or maybe even go out with them. I sometimes wonder where all the compliments went but really I'm glad to be rid of guys that would harass an insecure and malnourished young woman constantly.

5) The amount of SHAME that gets thrown at people for whatever their body looks like. I just googled the words ""skinny fat vs toned"" and it's fucking hilarious. The pictures they show are of normal people who probably have a reasonable exercise regimen but the accompanying articles are shaming them for not being fit as if everyone on planet earth has 4 hours per day to work out and looks exactly the same at every point of their life. Most of the pictures even appear to be the same person, just taken before and after an intense run or at a different angle. It's so sad that this kind of trash writing is readily available to people who are probably trying to research reasonable ways to improve their health. It reminds me of when I was anorexic and people said that I ""looked great"" even though I was extremely unhealthy.

Luckily in my detox from being deep in the fitness industry I've found some body positive health and fitness writers like The Body Coach who simply promote eating and exercising in a way that makes you feel healthy and confident in your athletic ability. It really makes me so upset to see the amount of misinformation out there about health and fitness, and I think these lies contribute to lack of athletic confidence in the general adult population. It's such a shame that these fitness rags and shitty food blogs encourage people towards yo yo dieting and body shame so that they can make money off of weird diets and home gym equipment that doesn't work.",,False,,0,False,Weight gain in recovery and how STUPID the fitness industry is.,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_w4nrac,False,dark,0.98,,public,41,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,41,,False,,self,False,,,{},,,True,,1658427664.0,text,0,,,,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So over the last two years I(F) have focused a lot of energy on tackling my ED which I have had since 2016.

I have a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in finance and am working on a graduate degree in statistics. I&amp;#39;m pretty smart, but before I took my health seriously (the real way, not the compulsive and constant shaming way) I had no confidence, which wasn&amp;#39;t helped by my brain fog from poor diet! I used to be shy about myself and afraid of everyone. Even when I tried to project confidence, I was extremely nervous and insecure. I also got hit on a lot by really gross guys. I always felt like they weren&amp;#39;t attracted to me or even my appearance so much as the idea of having a skinny blonde reciprocate their advances or maybe even go out with them. I sometimes wonder where all the compliments went but really I&amp;#39;m glad to be rid of guys that would harass an insecure and malnourished young woman constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) The amount of SHAME that gets thrown at people for whatever their body looks like. I just googled the words &amp;quot;skinny fat vs toned&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s fucking hilarious. The pictures they show are of normal people who probably have a reasonable exercise regimen but the accompanying articles are shaming them for not being fit as if everyone on planet earth has 4 hours per day to work out and looks exactly the same at every point of their life. Most of the pictures even appear to be the same person, just taken before and after an intense run or at a different angle. It&amp;#39;s so sad that this kind of trash writing is readily available to people who are probably trying to research reasonable ways to improve their health. It reminds me of when I was anorexic and people said that I &amp;quot;looked great&amp;quot; even though I was extremely unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily in my detox from being deep in the fitness industry I&amp;#39;ve found some body positive health and fitness writers like The Body Coach who simply promote eating and exercising in a way that makes you feel healthy and confident in your athletic ability. It really makes me so upset to see the amount of misinformation out there about health and fitness, and I think these lies contribute to lack of athletic confidence in the general adult population. It&amp;#39;s such a shame that these fitness rags and shitty food blogs encourage people towards yo yo dieting and body shame so that they can make money off of weird diets and home gym equipment that doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

as humans, it’s not natural to count and restrict our calories 
as humans, naturally, we eat what our body needs. all bodies come in different sizes and have different metabolic requirements. the whole reason we started “dieting” is because of stupid trends that become norms and expectations of certain people, and in order to look like that, some people have to change their lifestyle to something that is unnatural to their self, their body.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hello all, haven't talked much on here in quite a while as I've pretty much recovered and getting on with my life as a graduate. 

Thought it was time for me to leave the sub. I'm only making a post to say that because some of my posts from when I was struggling were very popular, so if you remember me, I want to show that proper, full recovery from an earing disorfer is possible.

I probably won't be able to give any novel advice (let alone anything more advanced than common sense), but my personal recommendations are: 

1. You need to eat way much more than you think you do. 
EDs change your way of thinking and you need to break through any 'maximum limits' you have in your head. Those 'limits' only exist to keep your ED happy, not you and your body. 

2. Don't try to set a 'target weight' for recovery. 
Obviously this doesn't often work if you have had medical intervention, but if you're recovering on your own. I tried to stop gaining weight 5kg below my set point. It blew up in my face. 

3. Eat the food you actually want. 
Do not try to 'fill up' your desire for biscuits or pizza or ice cream with vegetables or rice cakes. Instant binge trigger. 

4. Your body dysmorphia is lying to you. 
For months I was convinced I'd gained 'so much weight'. But then I got weighed recently for a medical thing and I'm the same as my set weight from a year ago. 

5. If you binge in recovery DO NOT compensate for it. 
It kept me stuck in the cycle for months.

So today I woke up especially ravenous (the very first thing on my mind was food, which is normal to me at this point but after 14 months of EH it had started to fade to being the 2nd or even 3rd thing I think of with an extreme extreme day once a week) and I immediately knew it was going to be an especially hungry day. Just fine by me, my body knows what it needs lol

So I went downstairs, made myself a very creamy coffee and drank it as I toasted some waffles, I had 6 waffles with lots of butter, Nutella, maple syrup and 2 bananas. I then waited half an hour and got started on some work and had to stop due to intense hunger pains, I felt completely empty, again normal to me... so I had 2 big bowls of cereal, cucumber and cheese and mayo sandwiches, a family bag of doritos and then some cubes of cheese on their own. Feeling good again so I did some more work for 2 hours being able to think about work and not just food.

2 hours pass and man I'm hungry... I snack on raisins and trail mix and m&amp;ms as I make pesto pasta with chicken and have it with lots and lots of slices of garlic bread.


 Then I have some tablespoons of peanut butter slowly out of the jar as I finish up my work. I decide to do some of my hobbies but all I can think of is food (mental hunger) so I have a big hot chocolate with whole milk, marshmallows and whipped cream, and then once I have some more room in my stomach I have a tub of b&amp;js, a tangerine for some reason, some waffle fries, I make a bacon sandwich with a fried egg and have that, a few cheese strings since I had really bad cheese cravings today, and then a few more bowls of cereal and some olives out of the jar. Then I also had a bag of haribos and some rhubarb crumble with custard 


Anyway... now I'm laying here and it feels very very painful for me to move and I can't stand up without feeling like I'm going to involuntarily throw up. I'm laying in the recovery position to make digestion easier but I'm in a lot of pain, taking little sips of water and trying to watch stuff to distract myself.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So I know amenorrhea can really affect your bone density and possibly lead to osteopenia. A little less than a year ago I went to the doctor about HA, and she basically told me that if my period was gone for more than 8 months then my bones may be at risk, but until then I shouldn’t worry. 

I began recovery around November of last year, and my period returned in January. By that point my period had been gone since July, so about 6 months total. My period was relatively stable until a recent relapse, and now I haven’t had it since April, so roughly 3 months. If it’s relevant I’ve also always had really normal periods pre-ED — I’ve been tracking them for years and it was extremely rare that they were ever even a day late in the past.

Anyway, at this point I’m just wondering if this is something worth going to the doctor over? Osteopenia is one of the only medical complications that I’m genuinely worried about since it’s not reversible. I never lost my period for 8 consecutive months so I’m not sure if I’m at risk, but at the same time I know my GP (and most GPs in general) wasn’t exactly well-versed in eating disorders.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hey guys! About a year ago I finished an intensive outpatient recovery program. I had non-purging bulimia, so my way of compensation was always exercising. It’s been a year, and I’m heavier but feel so much better mentally and feel normal while eating! 

However, I am so out of shape. I used to be able to sprint to catch busses, climb a ton of stairs, run for miles, etc. Now, I sorta just dislike my body because it only causes me issues, and because I’m not using it to DO things, I get depressed about it.

But the only reason I’ve ever wanted to be healthy in the past was for weight loss! Back when I was disordered, an active/fit body was a perk of the main thing. And it’s totally been worth it rooting it out of my life, but… i REALLY want my heart and body to be healthy again.

I understand that exercising requires routine, but every time I exercise I get so sad about the fact that I’m out of shape, and exercising turns into a hugely emotional thing for me. And like, I genuinely don’t like moving or exercising. There’s nothing in it for me, except long term health. I’m far more entertained with my mind and projects than i am with like.. running. But i WANT to run and be active. And usually I would simply focus on the weight loss benefits of it and that would motivate me to action, but I don’t have that anymore.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’ve tried to quit tracking calories many times over the years. But I could never shake that horrible “I’m forgetting something vitally important” inkling after eating without logging it. It’s like the same sixth sense of leaving the oven on. You can’t go on with your day until you “fix” it.

I started using an app to track my daily mood and habits (meds, skincare, etc.) and I didn’t mean for it to do this, but the routine of logging something into my phone makes that feeling go away. It reminds me that I’m not slipping behind by eating, and gives me concrete evidence of the productivity and healthy habits that I’m encouraging by recovering.

I don’t track anything food-related in my app because that is a little *too* familiar, but the motions of routinely clicking on a little icon and seeing my week in numbers (ex: this week I read 4 days, took meds twice daily for 7 days) finally made that “you’re forgetting something” voice go away.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hey all!!!! I just wanted to ask you all a question because a lot of healthcare providers are way too invested in weight as a marker of health, and I’ve had a lot of wonderful feedback from this subreddit

Basically, I recovered about a year and a half ago by going all in. Eventually my weight settled, my hunger cues settled, etc, everything’s great recovery wise. Im 19 years old, would consider myself fully recovered w no risk of relapse

Just a couple things: first of all, I rarely exercise anymore and I want to start for mental health reasons but I don’t enjoy anything except team sports. I’m worried abt my heart health bc I’m DEEPLY unfit, but I’m scared going to the gym/running will trigger bad memories

Second of all, i drink boba every single day now it’s summer and I am genuinely a little concerned for my health and wondering whether I should stop/reduce it. I don’t like to restrict anything but I remember watching a video by a guy who drank boba every day for a month and it rlly messed with his health. I’ve def been drinking for longer than a month

Is it a good idea to reduce my boba intake?

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’ve been in recovery for close to sixth months now and have made good progress. I have been able to stop weighing myself and have been able to start eating more than I ever thought I could manage. I actually was able to stop thinking about my weight and calories for a while!! But the other day I went to target and walked by a weight scale and I suddenly wanted to buy it and weigh myself out of “curiosity” and I’ve just been spiraling down into a relapse ever since I saw it.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi all,

So I just started a formal recovery from anorexia nervosa. One day I got home from exercise and a 2x2 inch square of hair had exited my scalp… and I can’t lie, it was at that moment that I grabbed the biggest bowl of Reese’s puff cereal with an enriched protein shake as the “milk” and like 6 protein bars and just went to town because I’d had enough. I need my hair. So of course after a massive energy restriction, limitation of most food groups, and over exercise my body is really not having it and I am experiencing extreme hunger over the last month and doing my best to honor it (it’s really all carb, sweet, and fat cravings). The gain of mass on my body is really, really upsetting but I want to undo all the trauma I’ve done to my body and be free more than anything. However, my hair keeps falling out. Like a lot. My already weak ponytail is now looking more like the tip of a tapered paint brush for thin line work art. It’s bad.

My question is why is my hair still falling out so much? Could honoring extreme hunger be a shock to my body that is making it worse? Is this normal in recovery? Will it stop soon? It’s been over a month into “physical” recovery. Honestly, I had mentally-compensated with over exercise to feel better about honoring extreme hunger so perhaps that may have something to do with it from the stress of that? But I just herniated both my calfs so I can’t even walk now so exercise, movement, and sport are off the table for a long time anyways. :( (maybe good tho for my hair.. :) )

Does anyone have any advice to keep my remaining hairs in my head? And to stop it from thinning and receding so much? Or any key items or products to consume or use to get my hair healthier. Shampoos, topicals, etc. My previously long, thick hair is a key part of what makes me feel beautiful and kept together and I don’t know how to cope with the damage I’ve done.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Talk of numbers (tw)

Ok so this might be a bit of a rant but I think it's really important to talk about how societal fatphobia impacts ED recovery and how it can hinder true freedom from our disorders in the worst ways. This is my experience but please share your own below! It's important to realise we aren't alone in our struggles!

So basically I had an active ED with no remission for 5 years between the ages of 19-24. It was basically Ednos, but I started in a midsized body and at the turning point when I decided to recover, I was a few pounds underweight but very very physically unwell from lax abuse, overexercising and years of binge restrict cycles. My body was suffering but all I got at the time was praise for how beautiful and model-like I look... I was fainting, my bloodwork was terrible and I shat myself a few times (tmi) but all society cared about is that my mildly UW body fit beauty standards. And I was asked what my secret was and how I did it multiple separate times!

I began recovery, all-in approach, and experienced extremely extreme hunger. I'm over a year in now and still experiencing extreme hunger, and in that time I've """"overshot"""" and ended up in an """"""obese bmi"""""" body. My BMI is now 32 and there is no sign of my extreme hunger stopping anytime soon... every day, I am still eating between 5000-8000kcal (in the first 6 months it was a LOT more!) And I am genuinely ravenous for this amount! Honouring my hunger and accepting my body has been so freeing. I don't love my body now, but I don't hate it either. I think of it neutrally, and I'm grateful every day that I no longer pass out or feel weak and my bloodwork is perfect. I'm happy to gain even more if my body feels it is necessary!

The issue has been... society. My weight gain has been treated like it makes me a failure. When I've been open about My past ED, I've gotten comments about how I've ""swung the other way"" and how ""being overweight is unhealthy too, you know."" I've even had people say to me, the nerve, that I looked better before and what happened? In the first 6 months of recovery I had both friends and strangers ask me if I was pregnant! Me healing my relationship with my body has been seen in a very negative light, because I was society's ideal and decided that the pain it put my body through wasn't worth it. 

As someone who was previously straight sized, I realise how many issues plus sized women face in today's society... strangers will comment on what and how much I eat, I catch thinner women staring at my stomach and then glancing away, embarrassed, when I catch them doing it. Me wearing a bikini is now ""brave"" when before it was not worth mentioning. All of these new findings have made me realise how fatphobic society is and how so many people would honour their hunger more if they weren't afraid of this reaction!!

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I'm really really struggling so any advice would be really appreciated 

I've been in recovery for the last 2 years. At beginning of my recovery, I was given a week left to live and was at the lowest point in my life. After months of IP,  I was discharged at a still UW bmi but not severely so and given therapy to gain the rest in OP. My therapist gave me a minimum meal plan for weight gain but also said to ""follow your extreme hunger"" and eat anything else I want on top of it. The minimum meal plan was 3500kcal.

The thing is, I felt absolutely STUFFED on the minimum meal plan and I had to force myself to eat it all. I think being in the state I was fucked up my hunger cues because I don't seem to have the capacity to feel hunger anymore... I'm not bragging, this makes me feel deeply sad because I just want to be normal and leave this ED behind. But I had to set alarms to remind myself to eat my planned snack or meal because I didn't think about food at all or feel hungry. I started doing this when a few days in a row I realised it was 6pm and I hadn't eaten anything yet and then had to eat all the calories in a very short period of time, which made me feel so so ill. 

Idk if this is related but I have autism, and will get very fixated on my hobbies and only think about those for hours. Even at my worst ED wise I rarely thought about food, I just wouldn't eat because my ED was about unaliving myself due to my c-PTSD, it wasn't about being a certain weight. Now that I've dealt with how to manage my trauma better I want to live a full life but despite a year and a half of therapy and OP I am struggling to maintain a minimally healthy weight due to lacking hunger cues. I feel like I constantly have to micromanage myself to make sure I'm not accidentally undereating and it's exhausting.

How do I give myself extreme hunger? I'd love to just gain until I'm solidly in the mid or upper healthy bmi or higher than that 

Here are things I've already tried:

-Having my really wonderful girlfriend help Prep me 10k calories worth of food/snacks every day for 2 weeks and forcing myself to finish as much as physically possible in an attempt to reawaken my hunger cues (the theory was I simply wasn't eating enough to be hungry but at no point during this experiment did I feel hungry for any of the food or even look forward to it...

So I had AN for 4 years and 14 months ago I decided to do all-in recovery. I wasn't very underweight when I started, only by a few pounds, however I was very ill and my bloods were funky, I couldn't concentrate on my school work and I would pass out a few times a week. I was also cold all the time and had extreme insomnia. All of these things made me decide to pursue recovery and the all in approach seemed like the healthiest way.

It felt so freeing to be able to eat whenever I thought about food and know it was going towards healing my body, I didn't even care about thr weight gain because looking back at my pre-ED body with a non-ED mindset I actually looked great and healthy.

Anyway for the first 3 months I ate over 10k calories a day, every day. After that, I eat 5-8000, some days 10k still like maybe once a week. And now 10 months on I'm still ravenous... all my physical side effects which I had due to my ED have gone away thank god but my hunger still hasn't stabilised. I've overshot my pre-ED weight by 50lbs and now I'm ""obese."" I don't care about bmi but it's getting really expensive to afford all this food, especially with recent price hikes, and I can't afford to keep getting a whole new wardrobe every few months but I don't want to squeeze myself into uncomfortable clothes either because I need to accept this is the weight my body will be at.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So I’ve been all-in for two months and I’ve been eating so much in this time period, that I’m now over my pre-ed/highest weight however my extreme/mental hunger is still very prevalent. 

Usually I’m a very logical person even when it comes to my ED, and I’ve always believed that all in is the best way for me to truly recover after being in quasi for 2 years. But now I’m having doubts, due to my eating habits. 

I’m worried that it’s turning into binge-eating rather than just honoring extreme hunger. Here are a few of the reasons why I think it may not be extreme hunger anymore: 

1. I almost always eat more in private, after having eaten a already large meal with my family. For example, I’ll eat dinner with my family and eat till satiety, but as soon as I’m in my room I’ll start eating the snacks I have in my room. 

2. I find it very hard to enjoy food ATM and even when I’m listening to my mental hunger, it’s as if I’m not enjoying the foods I’m eating and I get no real satisfaction from eating the things I “crave”. 

3. Every evening I have what I until recently called “eating-feasts”, but I now think that they may be binges. I’m not restricting during the day and after dinner I’ve already eaten thousands of calories, so there is no reason for my body to crave almost (sometimes more than) a full days worth of food. 

Like I mentioned I’m usually a very logical person, and I acknowledge that I sometimes have a tendency to mentally restrict (compulsive and uncontrollable calorie counting, fearing high fat foods, all or nothing mindset etc.), but I’m just finding it so hard to “trust the process” right now. I know I’ve only been all in for 2 months, but it just feels so wrong at the moment and I can’t seem to convince myself that I should keep going.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"(TW: mention of calorie counts, purging and weight)
So some background info- im 15 (will turn 16 in like 6 days lol) and had/have a diagnosed eating disorder. It had started last year with me trying to be healthy and lose weight, but of course i ended up with an ed. And so ive been in recovery for like 2-3(?) months.
Now the real problem is that im not actually recovering. Im trading one ed for another. I went from being scared to eat one fucking biscuit to eat 20 packets at once and god its frustrating. I didnt gain weight earlier but now that ive started gaining its getting scary.
I did have quite a good few weeks tho where I ate normally, but now theyre like.... gone. I am eating EVERYTHING around me. And the weird thing? I still fucking feel hungry for the next meal. Its like 2:50 pm rn and ive eaten approx 2,500 calories already and i feel like a fucking failure. I only have three choices in my mind rn, to go into the bathroom and throw up which im admittedly crap at, or take a little bit of laxative or to just lay here and keep thinking about how i should just die.
I just dont get it, i didnt even get THAT sick. 1700 cals sounds pretty good but i really dont understand why i lost so much weight with it. And i ate 1200 cals or less for like a month or two which really isnt that bad. And i didnt even get underweight??? My lowest bmi was a 19 which makes me feel like im just making all this up.
Ive tried REALLY hard to stop bodychecking or to stop counting but i suspect theyre what triggers this. I also always try to ""eat perfect""- basically 3 exact meals, two exact snacks and one small dessert . If i dont do this i feel VERY out of control just like now. I feel FULLY LOST UGH!!! I really don't know what to do. I feel disgusting everyday whenever i eat something extra and then lose all control and feel even more pathetic.
Also about extreme hunger, im pretty sure it should have gone considering my ed was barely even there? So idk what im supposed to do.

I just don’t want to be at another restaurant. I don’t want to be with my new pushy family members that love food. “Eat this” “try this” “eat more, don’t you like my food”  guilt tripping me constantly, my parents do it to. 

They will ask me over and over and over. “Try this” “common you will regret it”Never listen when I say no. I don’t want to but they won’t stop till I give in. My parents do this constantly.  Then they say, “oh see you did want it” making me seem like I wanted it. The guilt I get from this is to much. I’ve told them but they don’t stop. 

It makes me feel so bad that im eating a normal amount of food each day let alone being pushed to eat more . I’ve done so well I’ve done everything right, gained weight eat the right amount of food stop counting calories. Not weighing myself. I’ve done everything right.  Just let me be

But the constant pressure to eat things that make me uncomfortable is to much. I’m breaking, i hate this now im scared of it again now the constant thoughts are here. Im back like I never left this place in my head. 

My step mom has dealed with Ed for a long time 10+ years ago, she has been recovered for years now but… the things she says can be so triggering and upsetting. Both my parents know what I’ve been dealing with the past two years. My dad actually knows his boundaries and does not trigger me that much. 

But to have a parent that claims to have battled this for over a decade when she was younger to Constantly put me in triggering situations and say triggering things . It’s so upsetting. I tell her but she just does not get it. Like I’ve mentioned it so many times .

It just sucks that I think I’m gonna relapse , every thing is back in my head again. A stupid part of me wants this just to prove a point.  I wanna get very sick worst than last time.

Just a big fuck your to the world . But it won’t solve anything.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So, I live in Norway, about a 2 hour drive away from Sweden. A family tradition is to take a day trip with my family to Sweden to buy cheap food, clothes, electronics and most importantly, candy! Due to covid and ED I haven't been there for 3 years. I always used to buy 1+ kg of assorted candy, and that was always a highlight of my summers.

Fast forward till today, I went to Sweden again with my Dad, but also my ED. We did some shopping, and ate a delicious pizza for lunch, and I ate the whole thing. Then, I went to the candy store: literally being a kid in the candy shop! There are hundreds of different candies, chocolates, caramels, fudge etc. and I went absolutely insane! I picked all the candies I wanted (literally so much chocolate and fudge), and filled my bag with 2,3kg of candy! Not only that, I bought 2 large toblerones, 360g each, so in total over 3kg of candy :-)

So now for the next weeks I'm going to thoroughly enjoy my 3kg of chocolates. And also, dinner today is going to be pizza even though I ate pizza for lunch.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hey guys! I’m in recovery-ish from anorexia and it’s been a bumpy road so far. I’ve kind of been relapsing lately and since trying to recover a lot of conflicting voices are more present now, more than ever. Firstly, there’s the Ana-voice telling me to restrict. Secondly, there’s the recovery-voice telling me I deserve food and should eat more despite being terrified of weight gain. Third, there’s now this feeling of unstoppable desire to eat anything and everything- and a lot of it. I’ve read about others who’ve experienced the same; extreme hunger.

I feel like there hasn’t been a lot of official research on extreme hunger so I have conflicting thoughts on what the right thing to do is.

[Tabitha Farrar wrote a blog post](https://tabithafarrar.com/2017/02/anorexia-recovery-eating/) on the topic, encouraging recovering anorexics to let go of ALL forms of restricting, to let your body have as much food as you want in recovery. She writes about honoring you body and mind when it tells you to eat entire cakes or jars of peanut butter, for as long as your body wants it. She explains that, at least for her, the extreme desire for food settles after a while.

I’m curious if any of you guys have any experience with this? What I’m terrified of, besides weight gain🙃, is it turning into BED or bulimia (the latter is kind of the case for me now, after I’ve gained some weight in my semi-recovery).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So, to establish some background for myself. 

First things first: I'm eighteen and a cis guy, and I've been dealing with anorexia for, if my Snapchat memories are to be believed, about a year now. 

I don't know how it started, in all honesty. I don't know if I made the conscious decision to begin starving myself one day, but that seems to be the case. When I was at my worst, I went days on end without eating anything (not naming how long that was for obvious reasons), and when I'd deemed myself fit, I'd have a small bite to eat. Again, I will not be saying how many calories for obvious reasons. 

I remember going to the GP at my lowest and them telling me if I continued on I'd be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (in hindsight, I cannot fathom why I wasn't diagnosed there and then, my weight, eating habits, and over-exercising should've been more than enough for a formal diagnosis). I never made the mental decision to recover, I didn't go through the motions I am now, I just sorta started eating more, and I don't know if I even had an issue with it. I went back a few times; on all subsequent visits I had gained weight but can't remember what was said regarding the mental portion of the ED, if anything at all. 

Months later and I was still doing this.

I remember ordering lunch from Caffe Nero (on a delivery app but ordering nonetheless) without issue, ordering and eating a whole pizza without guilt nor an afterthought, grabbing each flavour of Starbuck's Christmas lattes over the holidays and talking with a friend about our favourites. 

During this I had started going to the gym, but was not counting calories or anything, though I was still restricting; eating less to compensate, adding up all the calories burned at the end of my cardio, like those habits were clawing their way back. 

Then the same thing happened again, and I fell into the habit of eating less, this time with a larger focus on eating 'clean', a slight interest in calorie calculating, and exercising even more. I'd wake up at 5am, eat overnight oats and a banana, go to the gym and run until I had shin splints, then I'd get home and have homemade jam on toast with fruit. I think I still ate dinner as well

I wasn't starving myself as badly, but I was eating well below my BMR, if I had to guess.

And recently I started really being inane with my calorie counting. I haven't gone to the gym in a month or so but still haven't been eating enough, I haven't weighed myself in ages either, I sorta stopped after gaining some weight back again.

Now I'm at the point where I've been researching recovery, I've been trying to eat more the past few days while still counting calories - though still eating less than I should - and I've been challenging some fears of mine. 

But I feel like this is too... easy? For me?

Don't get me wrong; I am unabashedly fucking afraid of gaining weight and to go through this journey, there are so many foods and things that scare me and that I haven't eaten in so long, and there is so much I know I'm going to have to deal with in terms of recovering and my body adapting, I'm already feeling some of them and I don't think I'm even eating close to enough.

If it's this... I don't even know. If I'm this ambivalent towards recovering was I ever even sick enough or am I blowing all of this out of proportion?",t2_dsvz185s,False,,0,False,"Feeling like recovery is too easy, or like I was never 'sick enough'?",[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_vza5yl,False,dark,1.0,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Struggling,False,11,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1657842849.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to establish some background for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: I&amp;#39;m eighteen and a cis guy, and I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with anorexia for, if my Snapchat memories are to be believed, about a year now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how it started, in all honesty. I don&amp;#39;t know if I made the conscious decision to begin starving myself one day, but that seems to be the case. When I was at my worst, I went days on end without eating anything (not naming how long that was for obvious reasons), and when I&amp;#39;d deemed myself fit, I&amp;#39;d have a small bite to eat. Again, I will not be saying how many calories for obvious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember going to the GP at my lowest and them telling me if I continued on I&amp;#39;d be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (in hindsight, I cannot fathom why I wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed there and then, my weight, eating habits, and over-exercising should&amp;#39;ve been more than enough for a formal diagnosis). I never made the mental decision to recover, I didn&amp;#39;t go through the motions I am now, I just sorta started eating more, and I don&amp;#39;t know if I even had an issue with it. I went back a few times; on all subsequent visits I had gained weight but can&amp;#39;t remember what was said regarding the mental portion of the ED, if anything at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later and I was still doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember ordering lunch from Caffe Nero (on a delivery app but ordering nonetheless) without issue, ordering and eating a whole pizza without guilt nor an afterthought, grabbing each flavour of Starbuck&amp;#39;s Christmas lattes over the holidays and talking with a friend about our favourites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this I had started going to the gym, but was not counting calories or anything, though I was still restricting; eating less to compensate, adding up all the calories burned at the end of my cardio, like those habits were clawing their way back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the same thing happened again, and I fell into the habit of eating less, this time with a larger focus on eating &amp;#39;clean&amp;#39;, a slight interest in calorie calculating, and exercising even more. I&amp;#39;d wake up at 5am, eat overnight oats and a banana, go to the gym and run until I had shin splints, then I&amp;#39;d get home and have homemade jam on toast with fruit. I think I still ate dinner as well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t starving myself as badly, but I was eating well below my BMR, if I had to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And recently I started really being inane with my calorie counting. I haven&amp;#39;t gone to the gym in a month or so but still haven&amp;#39;t been eating enough, I haven&amp;#39;t weighed myself in ages either, I sorta stopped after gaining some weight back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m at the point where I&amp;#39;ve been researching recovery, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to eat more the past few days while still counting calories - though still eating less than I should - and I&amp;#39;ve been challenging some fears of mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like this is too... easy? For me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong; I am unabashedly fucking afraid of gaining weight and to go through this journey, there are so many foods and things that scare me and that I haven&amp;#39;t eaten in so long, and there is so much I know I&amp;#39;m going to have to deal with in terms of recovering and my body adapting, I&amp;#39;m already feeling some of them and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m even eating close to enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s this... I don&amp;#39;t even know. If I&amp;#39;m this ambivalent towards recovering was I ever even sick enough or am I blowing all of this out of proportion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had KFC for the first time in 7 months and it was so meh. The greggs donut after was banging though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it’s because I deprived myself of these things, though I never craved them too much but I am on a sweet eating spree. If it’s not sweets it’s still fruit and shit which is sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say this fucking British death heatwave may be impacting me though. I haven’t been able to eat proper meals because heat death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your cereal guys, it’s really fucking good.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I have been in recovery from me ED for about 7 years. I would like to say that I am close to being recovered, but unfortunately that is not the case. I'm getting there though. Anyway...the reason for this post is to get some tips on how to bounce back from an unintentional restriction. Here's the backstory. My self care is shit. I mean, complete shit. It's particularly bad when I get very busy or stressed. I work in Human Resources (HR Generalist) and have recently acquired a HR Manager (my boss) who, after a year and a half, still knows jack shit about how to do her job. Prior to her arrival, I had no boss and had picked up a lot of the HR Management tasks that I had hoped to pass back to another HR Manager. However, since my current boss knows nothing after, again, a year and a half of being here, my workload has not been reduced. Talks have been had with said manager, however, no progress has been seen. About 2 weeks ago, she coincidentally enough tested positive for COVID on Monday and would be out of the office the remainder of the week. I say ""coincidentally enough"" because that was the same week we were rolling out new incentive programs for our employees and meetings were being held at shift meetings which are at 7AM and 7PM. Well, needless to say, with her being out the task fell to myself and my co-worker who is a recruiter with legit problems of her own. And before you say anything ... Yes- my HR department (which consists of me and these 2 ladies) is filled with a lot of drama that makes my life seem very boring. Anyway, since my HR manager was out, this resulted in very longs days that stretched from 13-15 hours. I'm the type of person that when I get really busy, I legitimately forget to eat and then it gets too far my body is then like ""Nope ... we're done..prepare to feel our wrath"" and then it goes downhill from there. I get exhausted, moody, emotional and any thought of food makes me sick to my stomach. I am then forced to choose the lesser of two evils ... 1) force down some sort of nourishment and risk throwing it back up (unintentionally) because I feel so icky or 2) continue on this path of no eating for fear of getting sick and sliding down the rabbit hole even farther and feel even more more icky. I have been trying for 2 weeks now to bounce back. I have been trying to eat regularly, even if I only finish half, that's better than none at all, but I'm still struggling. 

So, my dear redditors who I know have ridden or are riding this insane rollercoaster, can anyone provide me with tips? I was supposed to have a nutritional appointment today, but it got rescheduled for next week, so I'm just trying to keep my head above water until then.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"This is my first comment ever on Reddit so bear with me :). This site has been so informative, helpful and reassuring ever since I stumbled upon it about 6 weeks ago when I started recovery from anorexia. I am 5’6 and maintained a weight of about 103-107 for 6 years . I suffered from all the symptoms of anorexia (light headedness, heart rate going from super low to super high, hair loss, lots of people commenting on my weight , obsessed with food, tired, blue fingers, always cold). Anyway, I’ve never been formally diagnosed but I always knew this was a huge problem problem and want to be free of it. I started eating much more normally 6 weeks ago and slowed way down on the exercise. Surprisingly I feel much less anxious and shockingly unfazed about a 10 pound gain. It’s like I just got sick of it all, after years and years and kind of quit, just like that. I really wish I had done this sooner.

Questions:

Is this some kind of honeymoon and I’m just so relieved to be eating but I will at some point panic?

My stomach is INSANELY loud after I eat. For hours. Why? 

Why was my heart rate so wonky? That was a huge factor in me seeking recovery. It could be 39 or 180 on any given day. Will it even out as I recover?

I’ve been reading a lot about extreme hunger and feel weird that I don’t have it at all. If anything, I’m not really hungry unless I start eating. In the thick of my illness I could easily and frequently eat nothing until 5:00 pm along with 10 mile runs etc. I just kind of ran on this wired energy that is now gone, but it hasn’t really been replaced by hunger? Should I expect EH to show up?

I am not going to lie. I made quite a happy post two month back and I still want to keep up that energy. However, currently I am on a thin line between relapsing and binge eating and I want to get out.

My restriction isn't even physical anymore. I fantasise about starving myself once I move out, because I hate my body at the moment. I think I allow myself to eat everything yet I constantly think about food. Maybe I give up too easily, but I will try to explain why I think I am heading towards BED

1.  I do not count calories, I do not excessively exercise and I do not restrict any type of food (except for animal products for which an animal had to be killed ex: whey, gelatin and all meat and fish).

2. These binges are only at night, when I am bored and do not know what to do with my time

3. It is always caused by a fuck all moment or tonight by my stomach feeling like a never ending pit.

4. My body genuinely shouldn't gain any more. I wish I could be like yes yes no problem but gaining more weight would cause horrible bone and muscle pain. It would severely restrict my ability to move and I genuinely do not want this. This is caused by a separate health condition.

5. I feel guilty for eating like this and have started doing it secretly and fantasising about going out and buying everything I want and stuffing myself. Which is weird because I have a stash of my favourite food at home.

6. I constantly think about food like I am restricting or something. It has been worse I admit and I am distracted more easily but I cannot distract myself from binging. The meal planning never stops inside my head. I always look at food despite hating cooking and baking. 

7. I will eat until I am sick, Until my stomach acid is burning, my body is shaking and I can feel my heart pounding

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hey there. More recently in the past month I've been genuinely trying to kick my eating disorders ass and have it not be apart of me. I am trying to eat whatever I want no matter the calories and effects that it will change my body.

Since I've started this- my anxiety has seemingly sky rocketed, even causing me to quit my full time job due to the anxiety I have been feeling. I'm pretty sure this anxiety is coming from the ""lack of control"" feelings my brain is having now that I'm letting my body and food rules go. 

Everyday has been me dealing with anxiety to some degree and having a lot of days where I'm pretty much paralyzed and take naps to stop the uncomfortable feelings. I cant focus often and constantly feel nervous. I moved back into my parents since I feel like I cant work and make money due to my anxiety. 

Its making me feel sad a lot of the days or sometimes hopeless that I wont be able to function and live life.

Has anyone else experienced this when recovering?
Were you still able to be successful with recovery and taking your life back? Did the anxiety stop or reduce?

It's been extremely difficult to get myself to do anything or find anything that brings me joy. I'm not on any medication (I'm trying to enlist into the airforce so it's not an option right now).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I would like to hear your opinion, if it’s better not to react to reactive binge urges, that are not initiated by hunger, despite generally being under an appropriate calorie minimum for recovery in that day?

Hear me out, before you say that it is mental or extreme hunger. I do have my fair struggle with those as well and I think (hence the question) that it’s not the case this time. But EDs can be sneaky, so I just hope for a second opinion.

My question comes from occasions that I encountered the last days. 
Because it is summer where I live I stayed out longer than I usually do, which in return led to having dinner way later than I am used to have. I sadly still struggle with time windows and rules around time somewhat. But I still forced myself to eat something. Yay I guess.

However after finishing my later meals, my ED keeps screaming at me to now screw it (gotta love the fuck-it mindset), because I already “failed” and go buy things to binge on. I was not actually hungry or did really wanting to eat anything. It would have been just for a habit I picked up during ED times. (I am trying not to trigger anyone with behaviours and thoughts.)  
So I tried practising neural rewiring and not react on the thought and fight the urge.

So far so good. The only edge to the whole thing - why I am not sure if I am doing the right thing - is that at that point I definitely did not hit calorie minimum for the day. Which I definitely would, if I allowed myself that Binge. But again. In those moments it did not really feel like the times when I actually have mental hunger or hunger at all.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hello hello ! It's my first time writting here, and tbh i've created my reddit account just for this sub, bc I really need some advices/opinions, and it feels safe here
(btw I'm french so sorry for the mistakes/vocabulary)

Ok so most of my life, I've been fat, when I was small I was chubby and then after eleven years old I became overweight. I discovered with my recent diagnosis for anorexia that I had binge eating disorder without knowing what that was. 
At the age of sixteen I was obese according to my bmi. Because of lockdown, I stopped eating in between the meals and hadn't free access to food, and lost a bit of weight. But in may 2021 I still wasn't happy with my weight and started to dieting (🙄). 
I lost a lot of weight way too fastly but bc I was overweight, no one was worrying, they even encouraged me to lose more, always more. By december 2021, it was very hard (mentally) to have more than one meal, and I was restricting as much as I could.
By january I went to a dietetician and a psychologist. It was hard at start and I kept losing weight until april 2022, at this time i was really underweight, weak, tired, cold. 
I was so scared to eating normally bc even when I was having correct/big meal, I still felt unsatisfied, I felt like i couldn't control myself around food, I always wanted more. 
And guess what... That's exactly what happened lmao, I totally lost the control the first time I allowed myself to. 
The first times extreme hunger kicked in it was the messiest thing ever, I was eating as much as I could, during and between the meal. I was eating chocolate, sandwiches, cakes...

I gained a lot of weight. Like REALLY. After two month in, I'm at a normal weight, I even look a bit overweight (which is not a problem, even if diet culture try to make us believe the opposite)
I couldn't say my weight bc i don't weight myself anymore, and I'm not sure if i can mention numbers here, but I've nerver seen someone talking about a weight gain as important as mine. 
With my clothes, I can approximatively guess my weight which seems ""healthy""
BUT... extreme hunger still here. Every day. Before, it was mental/physical, I had a constant burning sensation in my throat, and couldn't handle the idea to stay more than 3hours without eat, even when i was physically full. 
But now... I just never fell full. I honestly have no clue about when to stop eating bc it feels like the food doesn't arrive in my stomach (except at some point). I am not hungry for real, just never satisfied or full. Always want more. 
My dietetician told me it was binge eating disorder, and he could be right but has also never heard about extreme hunger. He thinks I should eat more normally now, and warned me about the risk that I'll make my stomach go bigger. 
The thing is that i had binge eating disorder before. I have restricted for less than one year and I am back to a normal weight. I believed it was extreme hunger, but it seems a bit too much to be this for real.
(Btw I'm eating way more than when I was having bed) 

What do you think ?
Does someone have a similar story ?
And can anyone tell me about the weight gain in eh ? Like does it slow down ?

I couldn&amp;#39;t say my weight bc i don&amp;#39;t weight myself anymore, and I&amp;#39;m not sure if i can mention numbers here, but I&amp;#39;ve nerver seen someone talking about a weight gain as important as mine. 
With my clothes, I can approximatively guess my weight which seems &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot;
BUT... extreme hunger still here. Every day. Before, it was mental/physical, I had a constant burning sensation in my throat, and couldn&amp;#39;t handle the idea to stay more than 3hours without eat, even when i was physically full. 
But now... I just never fell full. I honestly have no clue about when to stop eating bc it feels like the food doesn&amp;#39;t arrive in my stomach (except at some point). I am not hungry for real, just never satisfied or full. Always want more. 
My dietetician told me it was binge eating disorder, and he could be right but has also never heard about extreme hunger. He thinks I should eat more normally now, and warned me about the risk that I&amp;#39;ll make my stomach go bigger. 
The thing is that i had binge eating disorder before. I have restricted for less than one year and I am back to a normal weight. I believed it was extreme hunger, but it seems a bit too much to be this for real.
(Btw I&amp;#39;m eating way more than when I was having bed) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think ?
Does someone have a similar story ?
And can anyone tell me about the weight gain in eh ? Like does it slow down ?
Ty for reading and for your help, sending love ☺️&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TW. Hi, I feel like I’m really struggling with food, body and exercise, but I don’t know if it’s enough to need professional help. I know you don’t need to be underweight to have an eating disorder but I’m not sure if I’m unwell enough to seek help or if it’s just disordered eating or yo-yo dieting. It feels like everyone has a shitty relationship with food, especially teenage girls so i don’t know if my behaviours are somewhat commonplace. About 6 months ago I mentioned to my mum about going to the GP but she said that I was yo-yo dieting and I should get off of social media. I know you guys can’t diagnose but I need help to see if I should book an appointment with the GP.

-I’ve been dieting since I was 13 and am now 17. During this time, I have been either in stretches of calorie restrictions or stretches of binge eating. In my stretches of restrictions, I have no energy, am irritable, food obsessed and don’t have my period.  I’ve probably had about 12 actual periods in my whole life. I calorie count and have to hit my protein goal as well or I feel like a failure. I have lots of memories of hating holidays because i had no energy to take part in activities because I hadn’t eaten. I get so hungry during these periods that normal portions of food don’t come close to satisfying me. I have to cook for myself as I’m scared people will add oils and butter. When I went camping with my family, I cooked all my own food and only ate chicken, rice and salad. However, I do feel confident in my body enough so that my family call me vein for looking in mirrors all the time. I don’t eat any processed foods apart from protein powder and spend hours on nutrition subrdeddits. I spend nearly all my time thinking of food, writing shopping lists, reading bodybuilding forums, looking at recipes, watching WIEIAD and trying to find different macro breakdowns and methods to suppress hunger. I had to quit my part-time job as I was getting light headed and weak but couldn’t rest. Eventually, I reach a breaking point in my restriction and I start binge eating. I don’t eat highly palatable foods either- just huge quantities of fruit, Greek yoghurt, oats, etc but still don’t feel full. About every 2 months ill make myself sick from eating so much. When I’m binging, my energy levels are so much better but my obsessive food thoughts are still there. If it’s a long stretch of binging, I’ll regain my period. My self esteem becomes awful though and hate seeing myself in the mirror. In terms of exercise, I have minimum step count of 12k and I weight lift 3-4 times a week. A couple of years ago I used to be way worse with exercise (crossfit, running 10ks and minimum 15k step count). I went to the GP during this time as I hadn’t had my period in over a year so they told me to stop running which I did.

I feel so trapped by food and my body and there is little space in my head for anything else. I went to the beach yesterday with my friends and we had dirty chips but all i can think about is how guilty I feel for eating them. I would never normally allow myself to eat junk food but there was no other options and it would upset my friends if I didn’t eat. I normally don’t go out to eat with friends for this reason unless there are calories on the menus. I despise eating in front of other people and it makes me feel incredibly anxious. I have no idea how to eat normally and am constantly terrified of weight gain but binging is causing me to gain weight anyway. I don’t see a way out of these cycles. I feel so lost. I have looked into intuitive  eating but have no trust in my hunger cues. I think I’d just end up binging until I hated my body enough to lose weight again.

If I book a gp appointment, I won’t be seen for over a month anyway and the CAMS waiting list is huge. I know so many people have trauma and other far more serious issues so I won’t be seen for a very long time. I’m worried that I’m making it more serious than it actually is and that by focusing on my eating issues makes them spiral. I thought about getting a part-time job again to see if I could go private but they require that I’m seen by a GP before as I’m under 18.

I noticed that I tend to have a big relapse that causes me to spiral and lose appetite and overexercise, and then some weird moment happens where I kind of ""wake up"" and see that my eating disorder is getting me nowhere, so I say enough is enough and start recovering (but only quasi really). I'm just really mad at myself and my brain for making me believe that I've been in recovery for years now and it's only led me to two relapses and recently a happy grace period that still consisted of me running my ass off and not eating past this certain time, or only eating this much of one food and not having anymore for the rest of the day, etc. I really just want to recover, to feel safe again. To feel normal and not like a freakshow walking around with my salad and carrots while everybody else is eating ice cream and having fun. It's like I know what to do, how to do it, and I have the coping mechanisms and techniques to get myself through the rough times, but I just can't seem to jump over that hump and start.

I know I need to get better because after this year ends, my life will take a whole new turn (hopefully for the best). I'm getting opportunities for this and next year and I want to be present for every single moment of them, and to not have my ED take another year away from me. I can see the consequences of my actions already right now; my sleep is becoming more sporadic, and antsy and feel the need to do everything all at once, and the next minute I sleep my ass off and never feel rejuvenated (legit I napped for 4 HOURS and woke up exhausted). I'm scared of weight gain, but I know that should be the least of my worries right now.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I got covid in late December (yaay /s) after being extra cautious the entire pandemic due to a shoddy immune system. It was awful, and now I have long covid. Simply leaving my bed is a draining process. For the first 3 months post-covid, I'd make a meal (usually just grabbing lone ingredients or heating something up) and I'd have to take a long nap before eating it because the act of making food was so exhausting I physically couldn't stay awake.

my body refuses to look sick enough in the right ways for people to think i really have an eating disorder. my eyes have dark circles, my cheeks are sunken, my salivary glands are swollen, and my knuckles are scarred. but the rest of my body? nope.

i turned 30 last week. my ED started when i was like 12. i kind of think that bc of that my body still holds weight like it did before puberty.

when i was 15 a boy told me i had “double boobs” when we were making out bc i had some fat on my ribcage. when i was 20 i was working out with a friend &amp; he told me i “gain weight like a dude” bc i mostly gain weight in my abdomen, but not in my legs.

one of my friends recently tweeted ab how she hates that people tell her they’re jealous of her body, but they don’t know she has an eating disorder. i’ve kind of always told myself she didn’t, bc she knows i have one and never brought hers up, and i wanted to tell myself her body was just naturally perfect. bc if she did have an eating disorder, then mine wasn’t bad enough. i’m jealous of her body, even more now knowing she has an ED.

another one of my friends recovered from anorexia. she was sick for around 6 years, “visibly” sick for around 3. im on year 18. my eating disorder could fucking vote. it could buy a gun. it could sign a lease, check itself out of a psych hold. it’s an adult. it’s not visibly sick though.

i hit puberty and grew breasts. i got my period, and i get it sometimes. my hips got wide to carry children that i don’t want because they’ll make me gain weight. i have a thigh gap as long as i stay thin enough, because i still gain weight “like a dude.” my legs will stay small and my hips keep them far apart. the irony isn’t lost on me.

for years i’ve been told by doctors that the only reason i haven’t had a seizure is because i take lamictal (an antiepileptic) to manage bipolar disorder. earlier this year, for the first time i willingly tried to get inpatient treatment. i spent months trying, but it’s not an option with medicaid where i live. i’m way too much of a risk to authorize a single case agreement for IOP or PHP. i’ve passed out and hit my head, the ER visit would get covered if i hit it hard enough for that. but not inpatient.

“living with an eating disorder” is such a fucking joke. “dying with one” is the reality. the world doesn’t take it seriously unless you look sick enough for concern.

I definitely had eating issues as a teen, I'm a trans man and when I was younger I was trying for ""force"" myself into femininity, and that included weight loss. I calorie counted and ate probably around 1100 calories a day and worked out on an exercise bike almost every night. I think most of my lunches at school consisted of water and cucumber salads.

I've tried to balance since then. I try not to eat too much at meals or overindulge in snacks, without restricting to ONLY vegetables or anything. But recently I can tell I've gained weight and I think I'm spiraling.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TLDR: After over 5 years of EDs I’ve finally gotten to a point where I can say I’ve recovered. It’s been so freeing and I’ve regained things like hunger cues that I thought I would never gain back again. Recovering is genuinely so worth it and has taken such a weight off my shoulders. If you’d like to ask anything or would like advice please feel free :D


Ive dealt with multiple mental illnesses/disorders in the past and still do but the one that affected me the most was definitely my EDs. 

I mainly dealt with binging and restricting for around 5 years along with pretty bad body dysmorphia that I’m still working through to this day. I thought I’d never get better and didn’t want to get better for the longest time but since I took the steps to just go all in and finally give my body everything it needed I have so much less anxiety and feel so much more free. 

It’s been around 2 years since I started fully recovering and I’m finally at a place where my body and mind feel healthy. I actually have my hunger and fullness cues again which I thought I’d never get back and can open packages without feeling the need to finish it all in one go. The times where I do eat too much, I rarely feel guilty about it and I just sleep it off. 

Not only that but I thought I’d gain a bunch of weight in recovery which was true initially as I went “all in” but after about a year and a half in I stepped on the scale and I’m pretty much back to my normal weight that I was at when I was binging and restricting except now i’m not going through mental hell worrying about food and calories. 

Some things have still stuck with me like the occasional thoughts of how it would be nice to be skinny again for certain events but since I changed my mindset from wanting to look small to wanting to look strong and healthy I find that my life has genuinely become so much less stressful. 

I find I’m still really easily upset and sensitive to anything regarding dieting, EDs or calories and have a lot of paranoia that people around me are lying and trying to hide their own EDs but I’m slowly working on that and have many years of self improvement to go.",t2_17ge0nht,False,,0,False,I think I can finally say I’ve recovered,[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_vwtlim,False,dark,1.0,,public,29,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Recovery Progress,False,29,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1657574746.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: After over 5 years of EDs I’ve finally gotten to a point where I can say I’ve recovered.

I wake up every day with an idea of what I will eat and how much; however, by mid-afternoon or early evening, I find myself feeling hungry almost all of the time and totally blow past what I had planned and eat much more. As an example, here is what I ate throughout the day today (censored with spoilers for obvious reasons):

Most of the carbohydrates came later in the day which is typical for me. I am always able to stop eating once I reach fullness but I always feel so much shame - especially when I find myself eating this much by 3 PM or so and the hunger keeps coming back again and again. I don't think that it's extreme hunger because I'm over a year into AN recovery. My stomach and face bloat so much that I almost look like a different person. All of this eating is beginning to reflect on the scale, too, and my exercise isn’t changing anything. I am about two pounds heavier than I was at the beginning of June and the number just seems like it will continue to go up which is so upsetting to me because I am not in a place where I need or want to gain weight. On the contrary, I should probably LOSE a small bit of weight as I feel very uncomfortable in my body right now. 

My family and friends tell me that they can’t tell that I’m gaining weight and that I’m not overeating, but 1) I can SEE how different I look now and 2) I really do think that I’m eating too much and may even have BED now based on the sheer amounts of food I am eating every day. My therapist has stated that I do not have BED since I am eating in response to hunger rather than emotions (I rarely if ever comfort eat) and am aware of my fullness, but it is hard for me to believe. I know that I was very sick, but I honestly miss when I had the ability to control my hunger.

All of this eating is beginning to reflect on the scale, too, and my exercise isn’t changing anything. I am about two pounds heavier than I was at the beginning of June and the number just seems like it will continue to go up which is so upsetting to me because I am not in a place where I need or want to gain weight. On the contrary, I should probably LOSE a small bit of weight as I feel very uncomfortable in my body right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family and friends tell me that they can’t tell that I’m gaining weight and that I’m not overeating, but 1) I can SEE how different I look now and 2) I really do think that I’m eating too much and may even have BED now based on the sheer amounts of food I am eating every day. My therapist has stated that I do not have BED since I am eating in response to hunger rather than emotions (I rarely if ever comfort eat) and am aware of my fullness, but it is hard for me to believe. I know that I was very sick, but I honestly miss when I had the ability to control my hunger. Right now I am in such an embarrassing rut that just keeps making me cry out of disgust and shame. &lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Hi, I think I have an eating disorder/disordered eating and started seeing a dietitian just last week. I wanted to reach out to this community and hopefully to people who had a similar experience or overcame their disordered eating, I would really appreciate any guidance :) 

My dietitian recommended eating every few hours, and what ended up happening is that every time I start eating I get into this ""mode"" where I never feel satisfied. I've had this really strong mental urge to eat really, really large amounts of food over the past week (especially at night) even though I feel very full physically. And so I ended up eating all of this food and responding to my cravings because I felt so tired and sad of denying myself food and I thought I would try things differently for once.

But I feel very afraid, I didn't want to give in to the anxiety and post about it but I would really want to know if this is normal and if I messed up and set myself back. I stopped counting calories because I think it would just make me even more anxious, but I would say it must have been around 3000 calories or so a day, more or less. 

What makes me feel the most worried is that I don't feel well physically, I am tired and full and haven't been sleeping well. It's like I'm very hungover (even though I didn't drink) and like I've been doing something very wrong. Should I stop responding to the cravings and urge to eat so much and be more reasonable (even though it feels very difficult in the moment)? Or is this normal and should I listen to what my brain is saying? Would you have any advice?

I really, really want to get better and would love to hear from you guys. I've felt alone for so long going through this and am opening up about it for the first time recently, and I really hope to pass it forward and help others out in the future as well once I am able to do so.

I’ve had difficulties with eating my whole life, I’ve always been very fussy with my food and the food that I do eat is very limited, and I have a bad relationship with food in general. My mom always tells me how I need to expand the food I eat because I’m storing health problems for myself in the future, which I am concerned about but I have a fear of trying new foods.

So that’s a problem, but in recent years (maybe since 2020?) I’ve started restricting myself too, and I’ve got to a point where it’s become difficult to stop. 

Food completely consumes my mind, I’m always worried about how much I’m eating, and calculating what I can eat in a day, and setting a cut off time for when I’m not allowed anymore food. I’ve briefly spoke to doctors, but in all honesty, when they’ve asked questions I haven’t been truthful with my answers because it’s an upsetting topic for me, so now I’m not really sure if I need help or not because it’s likely that I’m not that severe.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’m on my 8th week of recovery. Things were going well. I was able to honor my mental hunger, even when it scared me and resulted in me consuming far more food every day than I ever have. I was feeling more and more at peace about resting/not exercising. I was able to move further away from my safe foods and try more and more fear foods/different foods. And I was able to gain weight. I don’t know how much because we threw out the scale. It’s not been enough weight to need new clothes yet, but my clothes definitely do fit differently and a lot tighter now. 

I have noticed my resolve and my hunger changing though, and I am worried about it. I like the way I look now, and I think my ED is sneaking back in because I’m becoming fearful again of gaining more weight. It was easier to not fear weight gain as much when I knew I looked a bit sickly. But now that I look less sickly, people have commented on how pretty and healthy I look. And I’m scared to continue pushing myself as hard as I have been in recovery out of fear of gaining more weight. I’m scared of what other people will say if I continue past this current weight - if they will think I’ve gone too far/put on too much weight/should have kept my weight as it is now. And I’m scared of what I will think of myself too - if I will regret not just staying at this weight. 

But I know I’m not free of my ED yet. I haven’t changed and/or challenged all my ED behaviors and fear foods. I know I’m not done with recovery. I’m only 50+ days in, there’s just no way. But I do worry, because I’m barely having mental or physical hunger anymore. Even though I know I’m fearing further weight gain now, I know I would respond to my hunger if I was experiencing it, just like I have been the last 7 weeks - but it’s not really there. And I don’t know if that’s due to my body or due to my ED/fear. Food is kinda boring to me now and I often just don’t want to eat - sometimes out of fear, but often just because I don’t want to eat. 

It’s like some switch flipped in my brain and my mind is saying, “That was fun. You’re all better now.” Again, I know that can’t be true - I know I’m not recovered yet. But I’m not ignoring my hunger or cravings - I just don’t really have them right now. And that scares me because I don’t know if that’s my ED returning and my resolve breaking or if it’s my body being in a happy place. But I know the fear of weight gain is re-emerging in a big way now that my weight/appearance may go beyond what I’m comfortable with. And I know that’s highly disordered. 

Recovery is just so fucking hard. I know I can’t let my guard down now in this phase of recovery. All of this may just be my ED fighting its hardest to stay alive.

Things were going well. I was able to honor my mental hunger, even when it scared me and resulted in me consuming far more food every day than I ever have. I was feeling more and more at peace about resting/not exercising. I was able to move further away from my safe foods and try more and more fear foods/different foods. And I was able to gain weight. I don’t know how much because we threw out the scale. It’s not been enough weight to need new clothes yet, but my clothes definitely do fit differently and a lot tighter now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed my resolve and my hunger changing though, and I am worried about it. I like the way I look now, and I think my ED is sneaking back in because I’m becoming fearful again of gaining more weight. It was easier to not fear weight gain as much when I knew I looked a bit sickly. But now that I look less sickly, people have commented on how pretty and healthy I look. And I’m scared to continue pushing myself as hard as I have been in recovery out of fear of gaining more weight. I’m scared of what other people will say if I continue past this current weight - if they will think I’ve gone too far/put on too much weight/should have kept my weight as it is now. And I’m scared of what I will think of myself too - if I will regret not just staying at this weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I know I’m not free of my ED yet. I haven’t changed and/or challenged all my ED behaviors and fear foods. I know I’m not done with recovery. I’m only 50+ days in, there’s just no way. But I do worry, because I’m barely having mental or physical hunger anymore. Even though I know I’m fearing further weight gain now, I know I would respond to my hunger if I was experiencing it, just like I have been the last 7 weeks - but it’s not really there. And I don’t know if that’s due to my body or due to my ED/fear. Food is kinda boring to me now and I often just don’t want to eat - sometimes out of fear, but often just because I don’t want to eat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like some switch flipped in my brain and my mind is saying, “That was fun. You’re all better now.” Again, I know that can’t be true - I know I’m not recovered yet. But I’m not ignoring my hunger or cravings - I just don’t really have them right now. And that scares me because I don’t know if that’s my ED returning and my resolve breaking or if it’s my body being in a happy place. But I know the fear of weight gain is re-emerging in a big way now that my weight/appearance may go beyond what I’m comfortable with. And I know that’s highly disordered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery is just so fucking hard. I know I can’t let my guard down now in this phase of recovery. All of this may just be my ED fighting its hardest to stay alive. I have to stay committed and keep fighting for freedom in the areas I know I still need to challenge. If that leads to more weight gain, I’ll have to learn to be ok with that. Because full freedom is ultimately what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

,fuckeatingdisorders,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts over the past week or so regarding overshoot and worrying that it will never taper down.

Truth is? It might not. And you have to accept that. The product of overshoot weight is to restore fat to fat free mass; fat is always restored first, so to achieve 100% fat free mass the body has to gain more than 100% fat mass, which is what we call “overshoot”.

My issue with this term is that… you don’t know if it’s “overshoot” weight. Bodies change as we age, and you are *not* going to have the same body you had as a teenager as you do when you are a fully grown, fully mature adult. Hell, do you expect your 20 year old body to look the same at 30? At 40? After having kids? After health conditions you may develop? After various life experiences? Eating disorders are a *major* fucking strain on the body. There are damages to your organs, brain, bones, digestive system, immune system; you have undergone hormone disruption, catabolism, constant cortisol pumping through your body for months or years. Because of this, it is very likely you won’t end up with the body you had preED because, well, your preED body hadn’t yet undergone the damages of starvation. Your preED body didn’t *require* this weight the way it does now. It’s unrealistic to expect our bodies to stay the same indefinitely; they are *meant* to change. We see it from birth into old age.

Recovery can, and often does, take *years*. Your body isn’t stupid—it knows how much weight it needs to gain, and it will fight you tooth and nail to get there. It doesn’t care about some arbitrary BMI scale rooted in psudoscience, all it knows is that it needs more weight than it did before it was starved to function at its best and heal the various damages you’ve caused it. You will very likely feel out of breath often, feel fatigued more quickly, feel less flexible; it might be harder to do the things you did before at a lower weight, even a year into weight restoration… but again, you *have* to remember that your body is still doing a fuckton of repairs that you don’t outwardly see on the outside. For example: about 24 months into recovery, I was still dealing with all of the above; my legs and feet would swell from walking on them for only a handful of hours, I’d be exhausted at the end of the day, my lungs would burn trying to keep up with my partner doing simple things like going for a walk around the city or a basic hiking trail. It didn’t matter that I was going these things regularly… 28 months in, I no longer experience breathlessness or constant fatigue, my feet no longer swell up, and I can easily keep up with my partner or go for a simple walk. And I haven’t lost a single lb of the “overshoot” weight (I gained *at least* 30lbs above my preED set point). On top of that… you have all new muscle mass that has not been used/trained yet! You can’t expect to feel strong (at least as much as you’d like) without actually training the muscles first. You build it up like you would if you never had an ED, just like anyone else.

Is fearing it won’t taper down understandable? Absolutely! I am guilty of hoping my overshoot has tapered down as well! But it is rooted in disordered thinking. Is it *really* any different than when you were actively engaging in behaviors and hoping your weight would be lower? Obviously if you’re recovering you aren’t actively engaging in behaviors, but the thought process is the same. It doesn’t mean there is absolutely, positively *zero* chance that it won’t taper down, but hyperfixating on it is only going to lead to disappointment if it doesn’t, or if it doesn’t within a specific timeframe. **Body image is a state of mind, not a state of being.** Its not dependent on a set number, it’s something you actively work on improving. That is to say, you aren’t obligated to like your body post recovery—it’s entirely okay *not* to like your recovered body. But you do have to learn to accept it… which, yes, can be very difficult if you end up at a much higher weight in a fatphobic society that glorifies thinness, weight loss, and dieting at every turn. And I truly empathize with that. It’s not easy.

Here is a series of important questions to ask ourselves: why am I so hyper focused on this weight? How does this weight make me feel? Are these emotions and thoughts patterns productive? What are these emotions and thoughts patterns reinforcing about my body and my self worth; are they rooted in fact, or fear? Is this possibly a desire to conform to societal beauty standards (that are often unrealistic)? If the weight never tapers down, does that affect my commitment to recovery? If yes, then how can I work on that? If not, then is it *truly* worth hyperfixating over? What can I do to feel good in my recovered body *now* that is unrelated to my current weight? What has recovery given me that is not tied to to my weight and the physical appearance of my body?",t2_2n57xmai,False,,0,False,"Overshoot might never taper down, and y’all are gonna have to accept that",[],r/fuckeatingdisorders,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_vvpu92,False,dark,0.93,,public,61,0,{},,44428cd0-73c2-11e4-ae23-12313b0e44c9,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,61,,False,False,self,1657454510.0,,[],{},,,True,,1657453914.0,text,0,,,text,self.fuckeatingdisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing a lot of posts over the past week or so regarding overshoot and worrying that it will never taper down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth is? It might not. And you have to accept that. The product of overshoot weight is to restore fat to fat free mass; fat is always restored first, so to achieve 100% fat free mass the body has to gain more than 100% fat mass, which is what we call “overshoot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issue with this term is that… you don’t know if it’s “overshoot” weight. Bodies change as we age, and you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to have the same body you had as a teenager as you do when you are a fully grown, fully mature adult. Hell, do you expect your 20 year old body to look the same at 30? At 40? After having kids? After health conditions you may develop? After various life experiences? Eating disorders are a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; fucking strain on the body. There are damages to your organs, brain, bones, digestive system, immune system; you have undergone hormone disruption, catabolism, constant cortisol pumping through your body for months or years. Because of this, it is very likely you won’t end up with the body you had preED because, well, your preED body hadn’t yet undergone the damages of starvation. Your preED body didn’t &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; this weight the way it does now. It’s unrealistic to expect our bodies to stay the same indefinitely; they are &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to change. We see it from birth into old age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery can, and often does, take &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. Your body isn’t stupid—it knows how much weight it needs to gain, and it will fight you tooth and nail to get there. It doesn’t care about some arbitrary BMI scale rooted in psudoscience, all it knows is that it needs more weight than it did before it was starved to function at its best and heal the various damages you’ve caused it. You will very likely feel out of breath often, feel fatigued more quickly, feel less flexible; it might be harder to do the things you did before at a lower weight, even a year into weight restoration… but again, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to remember that your body is still doing a fuckton of repairs that you don’t outwardly see on the outside. For example: about 24 months into recovery, I was still dealing with all of the above; my legs and feet would swell from walking on them for only a handful of hours, I’d be exhausted at the end of the day, my lungs would burn trying to keep up with my partner doing simple things like going for a walk around the city or a basic hiking trail. It didn’t matter that I was going these things regularly… 28 months in, I no longer experience breathlessness or constant fatigue, my feet no longer swell up, and I can easily keep up with my partner or go for a simple walk. And I haven’t lost a single lb of the “overshoot” weight (I gained &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 30lbs above my preED set point). On top of that… you have all new muscle mass that has not been used/trained yet! You can’t expect to feel strong (at least as much as you’d like) without actually training the muscles first. You build it up like you would if you never had an ED, just like anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is fearing it won’t taper down understandable? Absolutely! I am guilty of hoping my overshoot has tapered down as well! But it is rooted in disordered thinking. Is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; any different than when you were actively engaging in behaviors and hoping your weight would be lower? Obviously if you’re recovering you aren’t actively engaging in behaviors, but the thought process is the same. It doesn’t mean there is absolutely, positively &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; chance that it won’t taper down, but hyperfixating on it is only going to lead to disappointment if it doesn’t, or if it doesn’t within a specific timeframe. &lt;strong&gt;Body image is a state of mind, not a state of being.&lt;/strong&gt; Its not dependent on a set number, it’s something you actively work on improving. That is to say, you aren’t obligated to like your body post recovery—it’s entirely okay &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to like your recovered body. But you do have to learn to accept it… which, yes, can be very difficult if you end up at a much higher weight in a fatphobic society that glorifies thinness, weight loss, and dieting at every turn.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"So basically I’d say that on average everyday I’m like 100% recovered. Only sometimes do I have any kind of disordered thoughts patterns.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Okay so due to this community I have come to realize that I actually was not in recovery after my relapse 2 years ago, but rather quasi recovery. I have been giving into my mental hunger the last 5 weeks and, as you can imagine, have been eating a LOT.

Naturally, I am gaining weight rather rapidly, which technically I know is a good thing, a necessity. Surprisingly, my issue doesn’t lie in the fact that I am gaining weight, but rather with my body changing so, so quickly. I can’t keep up. I look in the mirror and just don’t recognize the person I see anymore, which is upsetting and confusing my brain a lot, especially since I also don’t feel like the person I was anymore, with the active neural rewiring and letting go of my disordered habits. How do you deal with this? When I first was in recovery when I was a teenager I just covered all of my mirrors, but I can say that that was not a good or healthy approach for me. Any tips would be welcome.

Additionally, I’m starting to struggle with clothing. I’m starting to outgrow all my clothes, however, I don’t know how I should proceed from here. I’m a student and don’t really have a lot of money to spend on clothes (even though I already tend to but second hand) and since I don’t know where this journey is gonna take me and my body, I’m worried to buy new clothes only to outgrow them shortly afterwards due to weight gain. Do you just buy really stretchy clothes? I also don’t want to buy clothes that are way too big because what if I will never fit into them and just bought them for nothing in the end? This is really distressing to be honest. How did/do you approach this topic?

,fuckeatingdisorders,"TW: Self harm, eating disorders.

For some background, my mental health problems began at age 10 when my dad went to prison for fraud. My family dynamic immediately shifted into survival mode; my 20 year old brother became the breadwinner and my father figure and my mum began working three jobs to keep the mortgage paid off, my dad also very kindly left many maxxed out credit cards, because he was in jail, they all came after my mum for payment which was hell, all these banks calling the housephone multiple times a day, every day.

I became introverted when my dad went to jail, and my nervous/anxious picking and scratching at my arms turned into &gt;!cutting!&lt; , I managed to hide it until when I was 11, when I reached for something in the supermarket and my mum clocked on when my sleeve slipped. Understandably, she was angry, upset and distraught that she hadn't noticed my SH until that point. I got put in therapy and my mum was mega supportive in that she wanted to find a way to help me stop self harming and be around at home more when possible. A concoction of going into an all girls convent school, my dad getting out of prison and hitting puberty lead me to be feel uncomfortable in my body. My self harm became less at points, but I began restricting and purging when I was 13. I went through cycles of this throughout my teens, until I turned strict vegan at 18 and found that it was 1) a huge part of my identity. 2) A way of restricting food groups which people were unable to really challenge or take away from me. 

My mum has historically been a fad diet lover and complete gym bunny. Many of my childhood memories are being taken to the gym playing around whilst my mum worked out 5 days a week. She never directly spoke ill of my appearance, but I was always more of a tomboy that the typical pristine-made-up Essex girl that I think she would of liked me to have been. I met an older guy at 20, and jetted off travelling for a year and a half. unfortunately, this wasn't great for my mental health, and in order to grasp any type of \*control\* over my life, my ED came out full swing.

My ED lead to the eventual breakdown of my relationship and me moving back to the UK where I was to recover at my parents home (which had it's pros and it's cons). I was diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia/OSFED and put into an OP treatment programme. I remember having my first ""monitor meeting"" and being given my food schedule to follow at home and was dreading following it at home due to, what I now realise, my mother's disordered views on food/eating. For example:

* Eating once a day: My mum will only eat dinner, and drink coffee instead of eating food. 
* Labels foods as: Good, bad, treats.
* If a meal is of a substantial size, it's a ""feast"" - she would call my meals this when I was actively trying to recover, which would set me back.
* She's fatphobic - actively comments on peoples weight or eating habits, which often made me feel scared to recover (as someone with body dysmorphia, I believe I was of a much larger body size than I was at this point).
* If she eats a takeout or what she feels is ""too much"" will reguarly joke or say that it was enough for a week, ""I've eaten this so I can't eat dinner"" ""It's only light so I can eat  \_\_\_\_"".

By some miracle of God, I recovered well whilst in OP and entering the pandemic. Even to a point where I was able to move out and maintain recovery which felt amazing, even though I struggled with my body image at times. However, moving out, I was able to see \*so clearly\* the comments that my mum would make as I was seeing her less. I realised that I would be doing well, on the straight and narrow, and see my parents in which comments would trigger me and make me question my recovery, my body image, everything: at times coming close to relapse because of it.

Last October, my MH took a dip so I began taking antidepressants. I also chose to start the pill because I was starting training as a Nurse I didn't want to fall pregnant before I graduate. Although I was nervous about potential weight gain, my studies and very supportive relationship kept me grounded in my recovery. My mum was proud of me for studying, and I really want to achieve well for myself to show myself I can do it. However, I am aware that I feel like I want to reach my mum's expectations, or to feel commended by her. 

Recently, I have felt selfconscious and unformatable around my mum. She has, for some reason, pass comments on my past body; particularly items of clothing she loves me in, clothing from my active disorder. She'll tell me she worries, because she can tell im selfconscious, that I'm not happy in my body, but the thing is, I will feel fine, until I am around her again. I feel like it's a mindgame, a totaly headf\*ck. Because in a time of seeing her, she'll tell me she's proud of the progress I've made, talk sadly of how poorly I was, but then in another conversation compare my ""build, limbs, genetics"" to that of my dad's side (who are overweight, obese). It floors me.

My mother has low self-esteem, she barely eats herself; my mum, has an eating disorder? I think back to how challenging I could be when I was actively in my ED, the way I would talk about myself or even about others at times; it was my ED talking. One thing I know for sure, I need boundaries and to protect myself from relapse. I so wish, my mum could receive help, therapy to find more confidence in herself. If she knew how  this has affected me, impacted me, she would be hurt, broken, feel like she's failed as a mother (she has mentioned this when talking about how she feels she failed as a mother when I began struggling with my mental health at 10). 

It makes me scared to become a mother, this trauma I need to work through. Yesterday, my mum made comments again about my weight, my body. I spend the drive home and all of this morning wondering If I was to shrink myself, to go back to my disorder, would she love me? Would I be good enough? At present:  I am at the best health I have ever been at 26, have a stable relationship, achieving great grades. But because I'm not a size X, I don't feel good enough for my mother, and I wonder if I ever will be.

TLDR: I am in a constant head-f\*ck with my mother, she says she's proud of me, but clearly misses how my body presented in my active disorder. I think my mum has an eating disorder and I have adopted many of her disordered behaviours in order to feel accepted by her.

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Okay, so in my stupidity I looked around online for resources surrounding mental hunger. I think about food all the time despite being full, even if I eat meals and snacks every day and have done for years, and lately I've been eating more calories than before, so probably &gt;!2500+ calories!&lt; each day. I don't know how long/much I restricted, but considering my weight and height &gt;!170 cm and 51kg!&lt;, it makes sense that I'm thinking about food all the time despite eating properly, at least according to this sub and other people in recovery.

Cue the trigger warning. Some nurse and/or nutritionist (not sure if clinical or not) responded to someone who also had mental hunger despite feeling full from eating all the time. They said something along the lines of ""You've taught your brain to think about food all the time, and should do some sort of activity to get you mind over on to something else. It can be taking a walk, a bike-ride, maybe organized sports or other hobbies. No wonder you're hungry all the time, thinking about food would make you hungry!""

So this really rubs me the wrong way, and COMPLETELY invalidates mental hunger, stating it to just be ""habitual"" and ""something you've taught your brain to do"". So... am I just mentally weak? Did I just, TEACH my brain to look up pictures of food after eating a huge dinner? Should I go for a f\*cking walk every time I think about food (which would in my case just be an excuse and justification to eat even more)?

I want to hear your thoughts on this, because now I'm convinced that I'm not actually mentally hungry, I just happen to have taught my brain to obsess over food. (Oh, and when I play video games, talk to people, take walks, sit in a lecture taking notes - I STILL THINK ABOUT F\*CKING FOOD!

,fuckeatingdisorders,"Since Netflix recently added Zoey 101, a Nickelodeon show, to their roster, I revisited it for my childhood nostalgia. Like other kids shows, although the humor was cheesy, there was a charm to it. But OMG. It’s like the writers on this show were TRYING to instill a fear of food and weight gain into young girls and boys at such an early age. 

For example, the main character and her friends (all thin young teenagers)are all staring at ONE slice of chocolate cake. One of the friends says she feels “weak” because she got the chocolate cake and tries to pass it off to her friend, who then refuses it because “she’s trying to be good”, and then passes it to the other friend, who also refuses because “that slice of chocolate cake has like a billion calories in it! 😱 “. The friends then decide to “only” take one bite of the cake slice and that’s it. They savor it, and then take one more bite. The friends all exchange satisfied, but guilty looks and the scene ends -_-.

In another episode, the opening scene starts with the main character saying “Ugh, bagels have 300 calories in them”. Along with instances of characters (both girls and guys) saying that macaroni and cheese is “too carb-y”, calling Thousand island salad dressing “fattening, slapping candy out of each other’s hands, and feeling guilty for eating salad with a bag of chips, it’s no wonder I felt influenced to restrict certain foods even at a young age.

Another Nickelodeon show, iCarly, shows a teen girl and her guy friend being angry at another girl for DRIZZLING BUTTER on their popcorn, because now it has “tons of calories and is super unhealthy.” 

Yet another show, Victorious, shows guys complimenting a petite character for weighing 90 pounds -_- (This was Ariana Grande’s character).

The common theme? They all demonized food and showed unhealthy food relationships to generations of impressionable kids. (They were all directed by Dan Schneider too, a recently revealed pedophilic show director).

,fuckeatingdisorders,"
I'm having a very hard time lately. I've always been naturally slim, but after the initial weight gain, I gained the same amount on top of that. I've weight restored a little over a year ago, I'd say April/May 2021, also got my period back around that time.

It's not even just about the weight, but I just can't get used to having such a completely different body type. I've had to buy an entire new wardrobe, even tshirts didn't fit me anymore. Literally had to give everything away that I wore before, even lose, oversize cut dresses are so tight I can't wear them anymore.

It's also difficult because I feel like I'm just too heavy for my body, if that makes sense. I'm getting sweaty and hot extremely fast now, I've actually started sweating a lot, having sweat run down my face even when I'm not being active which never happened before. I'm having a hard time doing yoga because, no matter how hard I try, my arms can't seem to hold up my weight, even in relatively easy asanas. I get out of breath when taking the stairs, and I don't have a lot of energy (bloodwork's fine, everything's fine according to my doctor).

My anorexia started when I was 20 (I'm 25 now), so it's not like I was a teenager. I'd been at the same weight and size for years pre ED. 
I miss the body I had before my ED, I'm scared that I've ruined my metabolism and the overshoot weight will never go down. How long did it take you to lose the overshoot weight? Did you notice anything different about your appetite, your energy levels, anything? Did you do anything differently around that time? Please give me some reassurance that it actually is possible to lose the overshoot weight. I'm losing hope and I miss the way I used to look pre ED.

(And on a final note: I'm actually begging you not to tell me that worrying about my weight is disordered. I haven't weighed myself in a year. I've been in therapy for 3 years. I eat enough. I have a balanced diet. I stopped working out excessively, mainly doing yoga these days. I think it's normal that I want my old body shape back, that I want to feel like ME again in my body. And I just want to wear my vintage levi's and my old summer dresses again, buying new clothes all the time is getting so expensive and thrifting is not an option where I live.)",t2_3zuazs66,False,,0,False,Will the overshoot weight ever go down?

I know this may seem not that impressive or important at all, but I just wished to share because enjoying food is such a great feeling. I hope good days like these keep on coming! So, if you&amp;#39;re reading this, this is also a sign for you to go ahead and eat what you&amp;#39;re craving! :)&lt;/p&gt;
