,EatingDisorders,"So about 9 days ago I ate something and it made me feel really sick.. (I have a phobia to throwing up) I went to the Hospital because of this and they did an endoscopic procedure and said everything looked fine. However I was admitted for inability to eat or drink. So my mind kind of screwed me up because I am no longer on any psyche meds and I ended up not being able to eat ANY food for about 4 days because of this, and on the 5th day I was able to slowly eat Jell-O/Italian ice, basically 0 nutritional value. On the 6th day I drank a Cranberry juice, and ate 2 Fruit popsicles, and half a can of Ginger ale, and I starting having very bad acid reflux. Which I am now on 3 medications for. On the 7th day I introduced saltine crackers, and every time I eat I just feel sick, nauseous and kind of painful. The Doctors at the hospital said I was anorexic, and severely malnourished. (very underweight). I was released today after being in the Hospital those 7 days and I ate a piece of toast, and 6 crackers, but I just feel sick every time I eat. It is making me very depressed because I don't wanna feel sick anymore, and when I eat I feel sick, and when I don't eat I feel sick because my body is starving itself.

I guess my question is has anyone experienced something similar? And if so how long was it that you were able to eat without pain or nausea after going an extended period of time (5-7 days+) without solid food. Will it ever go away? I feel as if it won't and I just eagerly searching for some reassurance that it will go away and sooner then I think if I continue eating at least some toast and crackers every day to try to train my body again to take food.

Everywhere I went; I was cornered and on the path to death. I never gave up, the rigidity they said ASD brings stopping me from getting treatment in their eyes was what gave me the mentality of no shades of grey - life or death. I chose life and I am here today to advocate that no matter the challenges, we won’t be forgotten or removed from a treatment because of a diagnosis they feel makes it harder for them. It’s not easy and still is not today, like many; I battle every day. 

I publish my work on a site who gave my a platform for my voice. I have gone to organisations who sent urgent letters for support to MPs, ministry of health, and so many more places that unfortunately let me down. I didn’t give up there, after 9 or so months I created my own platform for advocacy and where people can use their healthy voices to advocate or just tell their stories, share their art, use writing to help process their emotions or share their support companions for a break away from EDs. To seperate yourself from that identity and form a healthier one and thrive. They gave up on me but I made sure I created a place where you won’t be forgotten and you will feel heard. I welcome anyone with a healthy voice to share their story. There are rules; no hate speech, no numbers, I do not allow pro ana or any other form or pro ed content, this is a safe environment for recovery, no slandering and naming of people or places. Because we can voice our needs without the negativity we were shown. That’s how you make change. You can live the way you deserve, be loved and be heard. I did this at my worst and you can too.

I do not exclude any form of ED or mental health.

,EatingDisorders,"So this has been going on for over a year now, not my whole life. I basically go through these episodes of eating a lot, eating normally, and eating very little or nothing at all. I’ve noticed these episodes can last months, weeks, days, or even hours. Over a year ago, I suddenly lost my appetite one day and I started starving myself because of that. Then when I started gaining my appetite back, I started coming up with reasons for myself to not eat, and I managed to convince myself that I didn’t deserve food. I remember going back into my room after eating very small meals and straight up breaking down each time because I ate something. I would just feel this intense guilt, and I still feel that same guilt to this day whenever I eat. So after that I went on and off with my episodes. Although back last May it has gotten a lot worse. And I didn’t think much of it until I realized I couldn’t fit in some of my pants anymore, they were too big when just months ago they fit like a glove. Then in June this whole situation got even worse, I couldn’t fit in ANY of my pants without wearing a belt, I started noticing my body becoming skinnier, I would either eat a meal a day or nothing at all, and even then I don’t know if I’d count those as meals since they were such small amounts. I’ve slightly recovered since then, I’ve gained most of my weight back but now I’ve felt so overweight and fat even though I’m on the brink of being underweight. My body image used to be really good just months ago, and now whenever I look at myself in the mirror I cringe and tell myself that I look fat, I’m almost never hungry. So now I find myself skipping meals and just overall trying to avoid food cause I want to loose weight even though I know I shouldn’t cause what I’m doing is extremely unhealthy, but it’s so difficult. Cause now whenever I eat I’m only doing it for the physical energy, and half of the time it takes me about an hour to even eat a small meal. I throw away a lot of my meals because I can’t bring myself to finish them, I just feel extremely full once I sit down with my food and it’s like this voice in my head telling me to “stop eating” “don’t eat that” “don’t eat until__” “you’re overweight” you get the point. So basically I’m asking if anyone thinks this could be a possible ED. And if so what should I do? Nobody in my personal life knows about this, although I’m sure a couple of them suspect something is up since some of my family has expressed concern about how little I’ve been eating, but also I can just kinda feel a few of my friends and family’s eyes on me whenever I eat really slowly or very small amounts.",t2_rkjuglko,False,,0,False,Do I have an ED??,[],r/EatingDisorders,False,0.0,,0,,,False,t3_wqe85f,False,dark,0.75,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1660706773.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.EatingDisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this has been going on for over a year now, not my whole life.

,EatingDisorders,"I'm not gonna come right out and assume I'm developing an eating disorder, but I suspect that I am. I only started having problems like this recently, but they feel pretty uh, serious. I dont like eating anymore, I have lost my appetite for pretty much everything.

,EatingDisorders,"so i’ve struggled with eating disorders for about 5 years now and i would really like to know what this means and what i can do to change. 

my ED story actually began with me being a very dedicated athlete and feeling little to no hunger which led to me getting injured constantly. i never knew this was an eating disorder until about a year later when i noticed signs of restriction and weight watching. during this time though, i was never a calorie counter or a number watcher, i just couldn’t eat. during quarantine i fell back in love with food and began cooking for my family every night as well as enjoying the meals! then flash forward to about a year ago from now, i started to obsess with the numbers. in a couple weeks i lost a number of pounds and woke up to not being able to feel my hands or feet. i was already underweight so losing that much took a toll on my body. i knew i had to change something so i began to self recover. i felt like i had recovered to a very healthy point so i stopped focusing on it, now though, i am at an even lower weight than i was at my “rock bottom” and i just can’t eat. i don’t want to lose weight or anything, i just want to be healthy. i feel hungry but whenever the food is infront of me i get nauseous and can’t eat it. i’m scared of letting this get too far, and i’m worried about my body. my family doesn’t understand this and it’s very hard to get help when those who can help you don’t understand or listen. i’m not sure what to do, i appreciate all advice.

,EatingDisorders,"Hello all. I am new posting here. Here is a background of my ed. 

In high school I developed and eating disorder. My family always made comments about me being thin since I was a child. My nana would call me a little colt, my parents would always talk to others about how I was itty bitty and how I stayed in small sized clothing for such a long time between ages 7-9. As a young teen my friends always said how jealous they were of my thin body and so did my family. I was discouraged from saying how I felt fat because all my family members and boyfriend were bigger than me and it hurt their feeling and made them feel fat. I wasn’t allowed to diet when my whole family was allowed. I was very controlled in a strict religious household as a child and I resorted to controlling the only thing that I felt I could, and that was what I ate and my weight/appearance. 

Fast forward. 

I am going through an incredible amount of stress right now. I don’t even want to write about it because it’s too much. I feel like my whole life is out of control right now. I am feeling the need to control my food coming back. I am obsessing over losing the weight that I put on this year.

I’m on day one (again) of my recovery journey. I’ve had bulimia for nine years and I am twenty- two years old. I binge and purge multiple times a day sometimes, other times I’ll just throw up everything I eat. 

To do anything, people need support. That’s why I started writing a ‘recovery log’ so to speak on Wattpad. I started yesterday, and I would love if some people joined and helped me through the process. It’s going to be a lot of ups and downs, and any support would be great.

,EatingDisorders,"quick history: i had a restrictive ed, currently trying to recover, still struggling with binging and having a healthy food intake. still has a lot of food fears, incredibly picky regardless and lots of food anxiety\* this is important.

i recently admited to my bf about my food anxiety. he doesn't know im recovering or that ive ever had an ed. i explained how chosing what to eat gives me loads of anxiety as my parents have always made/given me food and ive never had choice, (not telling about how the only time i did have choice and control was during my ed so chosing food during recovery stresses me out). this was in context to eating out on dates and stuff, and how id prefer if he just chose the place and ill happily go along and it would be better all around. 

he's always had body image issues, even though he is quite skinny and definitvely not fat or anything, even though he thinks he is. I don't care about what he looks like in the regard he is insecure about, and i do find him attractive anyways and ever since i started dating him ive known of his insecurity from sending like, shirtless mirror pics and from when he takes his shirt off. 

I always comfort him and say all the things to make him feel better etc, (all while thinking how hypocritical i am as im tetering on the edge of my ed). I want to tell him about my ed and everything, especially as im attempting recovering etc but i don't want to like, trigger anything or incite anything in him, as he seems to be very vunerable to such an introduction to a sensitive topic.

,EatingDisorders,"No. It’s not a choice.

Have you ever walked barefoot on the wet grass, in the early hours of a morning, to an apple tree upon which the fruit hangs low and sways heavy with juice, dew-dappled, like sequins of a little girl’s bow?
And then, have you reached up, as easy as one, two, three you tugged it off the branch, the droplets slid down your fingertips, down your elbow, your teeth snapped the skin with a loud crunch. For an interval you simply stood there, relishing the burst of juice that filled your mouth.
I have.
Our apples come out late summer, early fall, when the incessant susurration of cicadas that always herald summer heat, dissipates, and the air is then held by the gentle trilling of crickets, and the occasional screeching of blue jays instead.
Our Arkansas Black are tart, sweet and tangy. Their flavor is sharp, with nodes of vanilla and cinnamon. They are small, swarthy, with flushes of yellow on the sun-shy bits.
There is nothing like the freshly picked apples in the early morning of a day.
My life is that apple. It has everything one should want: sweetness, crispiness, tang, crunch, spice, sourness, with cherry notes on top. There are endless possibilities, and the whole world is laid out before me, for my picking. But most importantly, I have freedom. I have the freedom, to choose.
I could just reach out, and as easy as one, two, three I could pluck that apple off of the tree. I could have it all, should I choose.
So why? Why am I not making the choice to choose it?
Why am I not choosing life? Why am I choosing death instead? Why am I not choosing to feed my body, why am I choosing to feed the hunger instead?
It is so easy, just swallow that apple. SWALLOW IT, damn it! Why can’t I simply… let it go?
One day, feeling largely discouraged, Ron reached out to one of the therapists we were working with, sharing his frustration with her.
“It is her body, her life, her decisions.” She told him.
But that is, quite literally, an insult to Anorexia. And it’s dumbing it down to the highest degree.
Because no. It’s not a choice.
No one chooses Anorexia. Not conscientiously. No one chooses the hurt. The deprivation. The torment. The despair. No one chooses to cut, to purge, to starve, to break yourself anew every day. It’s not a diet you can simply turn on and off anytime you ever so wish. It’s not an act of attention-seeking. It’s not a pastime hobby. And you don’t do it just for the heck of it.
You don’t choose to lay in bed for hours, with hunger pangs so bad that they twist your stomach into knots. You don’t choose to chew your food and never have it.
That proverbial cash register sound dings in my head, every time any food item finds its way into my mouth:
1 medium-sized strawberry- cha-ching! x calories…
6 blueberries- cha-ching! x calories…
3 almonds- cha-ching! x calories…
1 Oz chicken- cha-ching! x calories…
The bill adds up very quickly for a serial Anorexic’s daily intake.
STAY IN CONTROL. The echo blares as loud as a bugle sounding reveille in the early a.m. It buzzes deafeningly in my ears like a blood-feeding insect:
bzzz… weight weight weight weight weight weight weight weight gain = you lost control, you big fat loser you… bzzz…
Chaos starts with this one bite, and then, like dominos, you’ll see, a panoply of perfectly awful results will ensue. One, after, another.
This strawberry… tastes… like… heaven. I am chewing it carefully, slowly, methodically, with intention. And the smell, oh, the smell. My mouth engorges with the juice, a rush of saliva. I know I already had my ‘allotment’ for the day, but God, I want to have it too. Perhaps just this once. Perhaps just this time… SPIT IT… SPIT IT OUT YOU FOOL! I apologize for screaming, but you know, that’s how I roll. And the rules must obeyed, for THIS is how you stay in control. You have a choice, you idiot, right here, right now, let yourself slip once, and it’s down hill from there my friend, like the Gemini VIII “tumbling end over end”.
There is always a moment, a fragment of a space, that gray area that swings between possibilities, the moment when opposing voices swirl in your head, coalescing to a blur like the ochre yellows and blues of Starry Night; it’s the moment wherein lies the choice. You can choose to spit out the food, or you can choose to ignore the echoes in your head, and nourish your body.
I have been so malnourished, for so long, that my body literally does’t know how to eat naturally anymore. It actually requires a conscious decision and effort to do so.
I am fighting it every waking moment. I think, it’s like attempting to overcome a drug addiction.
Because you can’t stop.
You want to WANT to stop, but you are so severely constrained, restrained, chained to the spot by the echoes of this addiction that is Anorexia, that making the right choice is… virtually impossible. When you are in the bottom of that chasm, bridging the gap to WANTING recovery, is like leaping over the San Andreas Fault. It’s like jumping across continents. Wanting to WANT to make the right choice, is the difference between galaxies.
The truth of it is, that it is a dilemma everyone encounters, at some point in their lives, to the lesser or greater extent.
Maybe its deciding to break some insalubrious habits; perhaps it’s biting your nails or skimping on sleep, or a couch potato turning gym rat (cue in New Years resolutions), to something more detrimental such as overcoming a severe, lifelong addiction.
But really, what it boils down to is the INABILITY to make a different choice. More precisely, the incapability of WANTING to make the right decision. Although, deep inside, we know what we ought to do.
So… No. It’s not a choice.
Not at the moment, anyway.
But I hope, that one day, in the early hours of a morning, walking the damp sward and with the fringes of my pants sopping wet, I will finally be able to reach up, as easy as one, two, three and pick that sour-sweet apple from my Arkansas Black tree.
Crunch.

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever walked barefoot on the wet grass, in the early hours of a morning, to an apple tree upon which the fruit hangs low and sways heavy with juice, dew-dappled, like sequins of a little girl’s bow?
And then, have you reached up, as easy as one, two, three you tugged it off the branch, the droplets slid down your fingertips, down your elbow, your teeth snapped the skin with a loud crunch. For an interval you simply stood there, relishing the burst of juice that filled your mouth.
I have.
Our apples come out late summer, early fall, when the incessant susurration of cicadas that always herald summer heat, dissipates, and the air is then held by the gentle trilling of crickets, and the occasional screeching of blue jays instead.
Our Arkansas Black are tart, sweet and tangy. Their flavor is sharp, with nodes of vanilla and cinnamon. They are small, swarthy, with flushes of yellow on the sun-shy bits.
There is nothing like the freshly picked apples in the early morning of a day.
My life is that apple. It has everything one should want: sweetness, crispiness, tang, crunch, spice, sourness, with cherry notes on top. There are endless possibilities, and the whole world is laid out before me, for my picking. But most importantly, I have freedom. I have the freedom, to choose.
I could just reach out, and as easy as one, two, three I could pluck that apple off of the tree. I could have it all, should I choose.
So why? Why am I not making the choice to choose it?
Why am I not choosing life? Why am I choosing death instead? Why am I not choosing to feed my body, why am I choosing to feed the hunger instead?
It is so easy, just swallow that apple. SWALLOW IT, damn it! Why can’t I simply… let it go?
One day, feeling largely discouraged, Ron reached out to one of the therapists we were working with, sharing his frustration with her.
“It is her body, her life, her decisions.” She told him.
But that is, quite literally, an insult to Anorexia. And it’s dumbing it down to the highest degree.
Because no. It’s not a choice.
No one chooses Anorexia. Not conscientiously. No one chooses the hurt. The deprivation. The torment. The despair. No one chooses to cut, to purge, to starve, to break yourself anew every day. It’s not a diet you can simply turn on and off anytime you ever so wish. It’s not an act of attention-seeking. It’s not a pastime hobby. And you don’t do it just for the heck of it.
You don’t choose to lay in bed for hours, with hunger pangs so bad that they twist your stomach into knots. You don’t choose to chew your food and never have it.
That proverbial cash register sound dings in my head, every time any food item finds its way into my mouth:
1 medium-sized strawberry- cha-ching! x calories…
6 blueberries- cha-ching! x calories…
3 almonds- cha-ching! x calories…
1 Oz chicken- cha-ching! x calories…
The bill adds up very quickly for a serial Anorexic’s daily intake.
STAY IN CONTROL. The echo blares as loud as a bugle sounding reveille in the early a.m. It buzzes deafeningly in my ears like a blood-feeding insect:
bzzz… weight weight weight weight weight weight weight weight gain = you lost control, you big fat loser you… bzzz…

,EatingDisorders,"# My boyfriend triggers me, and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

My bf and I met in college and have been dating since May. We lived separately when we started dating, I was in catered accommodation, he had his own place with a friend.

He's pretty skinny, which is something I'm kind of insecure about. He doesn't know this is something that makes me feel guilty, as it's not an issue (definitely not *his* issue), and is not something I want him aware of, or knowing him, feeling bad about. It is simply something I'm working on regarding my own perception of myself. I've never dated a guy who has thinner thighs than me. I know this sounds dumb, but sometimes when we're sat beside each other, and I look down, it makes me feel super insecure. Anyway, thats not the problem. Past my own insecurities about my own body, I really think that everyone else's are beautiful.

My issue is that I used to have an ED. Nothing super severe. I don't even know if my issues would be considered an ED. My cousin is the only one I've spoken to about it, and suggested I had one.  I still don't feel super comfortable calling it that, and wouldn't generally. I just didn't know how else to refer to it, or where else to ask.  It's been something that started most prominently during my teenage years, and got especially bad during COVID. I always felt proud of myself when skipping meals, or going extended periods of time without eating. I would exercise extensively for days, then get burnt out and stop.

Recently, I've been making steps to overcome this. It gets bad sometimes, especially when I'm not occupied with things like classes, but generally I've been getting better. I've been actively forcing myself to not feel guilty about eating. I've actively been making myself  eat three meals a day. I still get some serious guilt surrounding snacking, even when I'm hungry, but like I said, I'm working on it.

My friends all eat very healthily, and they are who I had most of my meals with in college. It was actually kind of easy, especially in the dining hall, as portion sizes were given to us (rather than serving yourself), and there were set meal times throughout the day. 

The issue comes with my boyfriends attitude towards food. He barely eats. This was something I kind of noticed when we first started dating. He has nothing against eating (apparently), but thinks as hunger as nothing but a mental thing that you can ignore, and food as barely maintenance. Sometimes he would offhand mention that he hadn't had breakfast or lunch that day, and I would ask ""are you not hungry?"" and he'd just shrug and say stuff like ""nah, I can just ignore hunger"". I'd urge him to eat healthier, and make him promise to have dinner when he got back to his place, but feel guilty for the rest of the day. I'd often skip meals after we spoke about it, despite myself knowing better. I know that his eating habits should not influence mine, but I hear him say that and I think somehow, like it's some kind of competition. Like, he hasn't eaten anything all day, but I've had two meals, so better skip dinner to compensate. If he can do it why can't I?

I would get super upset by his ability to just ignore hunger, because I couldn't. It was something I wanted desperately to be able to do. I would try everything, but just couldn't. But he can. He doesn't even seem phased. Why couldn't I do that?

(Also, I've tried to mention it a few times, subtly, to see if he was struggling somehow, and I might be able to help, but he assured me he has no issue with eating. He just finds it boring and wishes he didn't have to do it. He says sometimes he'll just eat loads in one go at breakfast so he doesn't have to eat for the rest of the day. He says it's inconvenient to have to stop what he's doing to eat if he gets hungry, so he doesn't. He doesn't get any enjoyment from it either. He says his attitude towards most flavours are neutral, or negative. There's no particular meal that he's fond of.)

I think the bigger incident for me came a couple months after we got together, and I went to his place for the weekend once classes ended. It was Saturday, and we decided to go do some tourist-y stuff. Whilst we were out, it got a little past lunch time and I mentioned grabbing lunch. He seemed unfazed by this, and we went to fast food place since it was close by. He was talking enthusiastically to me the whole time, but barely touched his food. He ended up finishing like half, then looked down and said ""oh you're done? We can head back out if you want"", I asked if he was hungry and he basically said ""nah, I'd rather go back out than waste time eating"", then we left.

Later that night, we went to his place and watched a movie. I didn't have it in me to mention getting snacks. It was past the time I'd normally eat dinner.  It was already dark, and I'd only had lunch that day. I was getting really hungry, but I just couldn't bring it in me to mention food. The guilt was too strong. About 2 hours later, once the movie was over and we were just talking, I had to mention it, motivated now more by the fact that I didn't want my stomach making noises. I still feel guilty about giving in and saying something. He didn't have any food in the house, which made sense because he'd been visiting his parents for like a week and a half before this, and his roommate had gone home for the summer. So I suggested we ordered something. He seemed reluctant. Or maybe I was paranoid. He said he wasn't really hungry, so I can just order what I wanted. I couldn't. It just had to feel mutual, otherwise I don't think I could fight off the guilt. After a while, we ordered something for us both. Two separate meals. Neither of us finished them.

The next morning we woke up and just hung out for a bit, chatted, watched some youtube, etc. He never mentioned breakfast. We were set to go out around 2/3pm-ish and meet some mutual friends. I was starting to get really hungry. Even as I got ready to go out, I didn't have it in me to mention lunch. I snuck a few fries from yesterday's leftovers to ensure my stomach wasn't making noises when we went out, and still felt bad.

I went back to my own place after we met our friends, even though I was meant to spend another night with him.

We hung out a few more times before I went home for the summer. I was distant for a while. I didn't mean to be, but I just was.  Now, I have a lot of anxiety surrounding going back next semester, and one of the issues I keep thinking about is the guilt I feel eating around him. It's not his fault, I know that, it's my own issues that are getting in the way, but knowing that doesn't make it any easier.

I've had a kinda bad summer with it, counting calories and stuff, but nothing too bad. I'm just worried that being back there will make me bad again. I won't have a dining hall either this year. I'm cooking for myself.

I know there's not really a clear question that I'm asking here, I just don't know what to do. I really like him, a lot, and he's not doing anything wrong. I'm the problem. I need to be stronger. But it's just so hard. Surely, what's he's doing isn't healthy either? But when he explains himself so confidently, I can't help feeling like I'm failing somehow, and I'm weak for not being able to do the same.

If this isn't the right place for this kind of post, just let me know. I've never used reddit before, and didn't know who else to ask about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Some side information:

I haven't really spoken to anyone about my relationship, besides a cousin of mine who I'm pretty close with and has similar struggles. But this never went beyond guilty confessions and an agreement that it was unhealthy. Family and friends are aware of how little I eat and I think my sister knows I have some guilt surrounding eating, but I've never mentioned this specific issue to anyone.

Also, my ex often hinted at me being fat. I'm average weight for my height, I know this logically, but a lot of his influence still impacts my mental process.  I won't mention specific quotes, since I don't really want anyone finding this, but they're hard to describe.

Sometimes I have these more severe episodes in which I restrict for days to a few weeks. I find this happens when I'm really stressed or anxious about something too. And throughout the day sometimes I get the feeling that I'm starving. But I can't take more than a few bites out of anything without feeling sick or getting full right away.  And so I'm walking around places feeling this horrible pit in my stomach. 

It's an odd feeling I can't explain, and I haven't had one in a bit so I'm having trouble remembering. It gets hard to function and try to go back into a somewhat normal state. I've been regularly hungry before -- but this feeling is something else. It's like I don't even feel half there. It's so odd.

And throughout the day sometimes I get the feeling that I&amp;#39;m starving. But I can&amp;#39;t take more than a few bites out of anything without feeling sick or getting full right away.  And so I&amp;#39;m walking around places feeling this horrible pit in my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an odd feeling I can&amp;#39;t explain, and I haven&amp;#39;t had one in a bit so I&amp;#39;m having trouble remembering. It gets hard to function and try to go back into a somewhat normal state. I&amp;#39;ve been regularly hungry before -- but this feeling is something else. It&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t even feel half there. It&amp;#39;s so odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what this is or if theres terms for it. I want to know why this happens, and if anyone else experiences it too?&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"I've heard that a lot of people start losing their hair in recovery. My case has been a bit different and I'd like to hear if anyone has gone through the same. 😅


So my whole ED lasted about 8 months. I did eat whole meals throughout the whole time but just in calorie deficit so I lost some weight. I didn't go severely underweight and didn't lose my period but I lost like 70% of my hair...


The weird thing is that I never noticed my hair falling. 😅 Now that I think back, there were definitely some clumps in the drain but I've always lost a little bit of hair in the shower and so I wasn't too worried. And I think my ED brain just made me focus only on my weight... This May however, I noticed that my hair was EXTREMELY THIN.

Ever since then I've been very observant with my hair and it doesn't seem to shed. 🤯 (just a tiny bit in the shower) I've been eating well and taking vitamins (I had low ferritin too) but I just don't understand: 

How did the shedding end even before I had fixed my diet if it's due to malnutrition? I mean at this point I haven't seen any shedding at any point basically and it's all gone 😂 First I thought that it was going to shed more after I start eating better but it hasn't. 


That's obviously a good thing but I just don't understand cause from what I've heard, it takes at least 6 months to correct the malnutrition.

&lt;p&gt;Ever since then I&amp;#39;ve been very observant with my hair and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to shed. 🤯 (just a tiny bit in the shower) I&amp;#39;ve been eating well and taking vitamins (I had low ferritin too) but I just don&amp;#39;t understand: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the shedding end even before I had fixed my diet if it&amp;#39;s due to malnutrition? I mean at this point I haven&amp;#39;t seen any shedding at any point basically and it&amp;#39;s all gone 😂 First I thought that it was going to shed more after I start eating better but it hasn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s obviously a good thing but I just don&amp;#39;t understand cause from what I&amp;#39;ve heard, it takes at least 6 months to correct the malnutrition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already looks like there&amp;#39;s a regrowth (some of the growth is pretty long already) but I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m just imagining it cause how could it happen this fast?&lt;/p&gt;

Then there’s the days that I feel so bad and panic so bad that I can barely force myself to eat something.

I’m also five months postpartum and I’ve never been this big without being pregnant in my life. I’m terrified to get a scale bc I’m scared I’m gonna trigger bulimia/anorexia disorders again. I have two little girls and I want so badly to be a better role model for my babies than my mom was to me.

I want to teach them to strive to be healthy but to also love yourself and your body where it’s at. They deserve that. They’re only two years old and five months. So I have some time to change this around more than I have in the past.

But I want to do this for myself too. Why do I have to keep beating myself up and putting so so much value as me as a person on my weight?? I hate this so so much. It gives me anxiety and makes me feel less of a person and worthy of love.

It even effects my sex life to a degree bc if I don’t feel sexy or attractive my husband and I have sex less often. I love sex with my husband but if I feel bad ab myself it just gives me anxiety):

I've been recovered for a few years now and I've been doing really well. Soon I will start my psychology internship in a clinical setting for eating disorder treatment (teens/young adults). However, because of recent illness I have lost quite a bit of weight and am now technically in the underweight category.

I remember that I was constantly comparing myself to others while I had an ED and also did this with therapists. Im not sure if this is a universal thing.

Do you think this will be a problem? If so, anything I can do to change that? I don't want people to feel like I'm ""flaunting"" my body shape in their face...

Every once in a while, I’ll deal with urges to act on old restricting behaviors, but I’d typically either be able to talk myself out of them or I could lean on my husband or others around me for help and support (typically distraction or reminders that, hey, it’s time to eat/I need food to get through my day). However, my husband recently got a job that keeps him out of the house for most of the day, and I’ve been struggling with not falling into old patterns. I work from home, so I’m *completely* alone most of the time, which also makes it hard to like, just eat when other people are eating as a social thing.

,EatingDisorders,"i’ve been struggling with not being able to eat enough or eat at all since last august. i suffered a traumatic experience as of last year and i’ve been dealing with the consequences with my stomach. so for background information, last august i was fresh out the hospital for a rhinoplasty surgery,my boyfriend at the time broke up with me second day i came out the hospital, while i was bedridden in a neckbrace and couldnt do anything but just lay there and listen to him break up with me. 

i WISH he could have done it any other day but this deeply affected my recovery procress, first of all i was not allowed to even cry about it because i had tubes up my nose and stitches hold it in place, my face swelled up and i was on 7 different medications, that i was throwing up all of them. No it wasn’t the meds making me throw up, I’ve had anxiety and im the type to struggle breathing and i throw up and shake. 

and i took every kind of nausea relief medicine that i ended up throwing back up. i am not kidding when i say this, but i was throwing up for an ENTIRE month straight, EVERY single morning id wake up at 7 am to throw up and from there id sit in my bathroom until 11 am because if i went back to bed before id feel like throwing up. i threw up so much it was just blood and bile at one point. i couldnt even eat soup or jello because id throw it up. my throat burned from the pain and my stomach physically hurt from the pressure of throwing up so much. 

i never visited the doctor after because i thought i was “fine,” not even my parents know what i went through because i hid it from them and they’re the type to be like “get over it.” i dont know what exactly happened to my stomach but all i know is that ive dropped a noticable amount of weight, i am a few pounds away from being underweight and im mildly lactose intolerant now or idk if its ibs d lol. 

i dont know if i should see a doctor yet im so used to being invalidated ab my shit. but i will say i was working out but i noticed i dropped more weight because i couldnt eat enough to sustain the muscle i was gaining, with or without protein shake. just drinking one is already so heavy on my stomach and its hard to eat anything. the only thing i mainly eat is fish in all kinds of forms cooked raw whatever and chicken and rice veggies and overall healthy shit. 

i dont know how to explain it but every time im eating i get a wave of extreme disgust and sometimes i gag in the middle of eating and i have to stop otherwise i feel like throwing up. because of that its hard for me to even get full in the first place. 

i just wanna look healthy again because my family pointed out how thinner i got and its noticable in my arms and legs and face. ive been told working out is supposed to make you more hungry but for me it sometimes makes me wanna throw up or sometimes i still wont have appetite even im dying and sweating. idk what to do anymore :/",t2_5hoftgj8,False,,0,False,"do i have an eating disorder, and how do i deal with it",[],r/EatingDisorders,False,0.0,,0,,,False,t3_wkd0o9,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,1660075271.0,,[],{},,,True,,1660074966.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.EatingDisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i’ve been struggling with not being able to eat enough or eat at all since last august. i suffered a traumatic experience as of last year and i’ve been dealing with the consequences with my stomach. so for background information, last august i was fresh out the hospital for a rhinoplasty surgery,my boyfriend at the time broke up with me second day i came out the hospital, while i was bedridden in a neckbrace and couldnt do anything but just lay there and listen to him break up with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i WISH he could have done it any other day but this deeply affected my recovery procress, first of all i was not allowed to even cry about it because i had tubes up my nose and stitches hold it in place, my face swelled up and i was on 7 different medications, that i was throwing up all of them. No it wasn’t the meds making me throw up, I’ve had anxiety and im the type to struggle breathing and i throw up and shake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i took every kind of nausea relief medicine that i ended up throwing back up. i am not kidding when i say this, but i was throwing up for an ENTIRE month straight, EVERY single morning id wake up at 7 am to throw up and from there id sit in my bathroom until 11 am because if i went back to bed before id feel like throwing up. i threw up so much it was just blood and bile at one point. i couldnt even eat soup or jello because id throw it up. my throat burned from the pain and my stomach physically hurt from the pressure of throwing up so much. &lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Basically I got beat down by my binge eating &amp; wt loss attempts. I started as a child to use food for comfort, boredom, entertainment, lonliness and any other reason. I started dieting at age 12.  I tried the things most people try. I'd have success and wt loss. Get patted on the back and feel good, but it wouldn't last. Why? Hadn't i arrived? Hadn't i achieved what i worked so hard for. For reasons i didn't understand and put much time into therapy trying to unpack i would go back to compulsive eating. It would get worse overtime. I would go to exremes with food/eating/wt. At times i was morbidly obese, other times i looked like a fitness insructor.  To compensate for my eating I would compulsively exercise, throw off my hormone balance and gave myself a hernia. I cut out all carbs at one point and then started to compulsively eat salad. I worked in a career where i needed to model good health - why couldn't i do it for good and all? 

 With all this I came to realize I was screwed between the ears when it came to managing food/wt/eating. I tried all the options normal eaters try. I'd have temporary success. Eventually I'd go back to compulsive eating (eating outside of nourishment). I was baffled. Why did the things that worked for normal eaters not work for me? I learned in the 12 step program that I have an actual illness of the mind and body, but it centers in my mind. My mind will always take me back to compulsive eating as a solution because i am just wired that way. At rest my spirit is disturbed and it's only a matter of time before i compulsively eat. That is why i keep going back to it even when i swear off and have every reason to stop. I could stop compulsively eating, but i could not STAY stopped. Also, I could not stop myself in the middle of a binge - I'd lose control and go on a spree eating way more than intended. I wondered if i was doomed? It sure felt that way. 

Then i came to OA. I got on a meeting &amp; listened. Later spoke with a sponsor, heard her story and it resononated with me. I asked her to sponsor me. The vital actions i took were getting a sponsor (someone already recovered who could guide me through the steps and help me see things my sick unrecovered mind could not see) AND work the 12 steps quickly out of the big book of AA, adapted for compulsive eating to get recovered. OA was definitely the last house on the block for me and it needed to be. How else would i know how powerless I am.  I had to hit rock bottom with my compulsive eating before I'd have the willingness, open-mindedness and humility to say i can't do this on my own. My logic &amp;  willpower can't fix this! I needed help and became willing to do anything to recover.  My behavior was leading me to a life full of health problems and an early death if i stayed on that path.  Today, miraculously I CAN eat for nourishment.  I no longer turn to food to ""fix"" the way i feel or ""to deal"" with life stressors or situations i feel I have no control. I am free. I am grateful to have the 12 step program and work the steps because life is so much now. I'm a saner, happier person.

,EatingDisorders," I think I have an eating disorder.

I’ve always had a bad relationship with food esp now that I have a chronic gastro condition that causes me to throw up on a pretty regular basis. Thus, I’ve become really avoidant of food and always feel nauseous.

In many ways, I do genuinely try to eat but struggle a lot. I’ll have little interest in food or when I try to eat something I typically like it can feel “wrong” in my mouth and almost make me gag. But I really realized that this might be an actual eating disorder after yesterday; I hadn’t eaten much in the past few days so I got a bagel. I pushed myself to eat half and was proud of myself, but then the whole day went by and I didn’t eat anything else, and when I realized that late at night I was kind of felt…happy? Powerful? Which obv is bad.

I’ve been small the entirety of my life and plenty of people tell me I should bulk up to try to help me pass as a man, so I would try harder to eat and start working out with a trainer, but every time I went to weigh myself and check on my progress, I would be relieved when I was still under what’s considered a healthy weight. When I was a girl, I was always praised for being petite and having a “perfect” female body, and for a while it became that if I had to be a girl I wanted to be the most attractive of girls, and I guess a lot of that still lives within me.

I’m not really sure what to do about all this since I have no job, no insurance, and have just moved state so have no established relationship with any medical professional. Who knows how much longer until I’m homeless too, which makes it worse; the less I eat the more money I save.

,EatingDisorders,"I’ve avoided seeking help because I was overweight and anytime I was trying to get help for my PCOS doctors told me to lose the weight. This started at age 16-17. 

Sometimes I genuinely forget to eat and because I have ADHD I can zoom through the day on nothing but the power of whatever excites me. I loved school because of the structure for eating - breakfast or breakfast programs but when I hit post secondary onwards everything fell apart. I would not eat, come home, and eat everything with no control. 

The ADHD would have me hyperfixate on one type of food and luckily last year it was healthy foods, but now I can’t seem to eat enough at a consistent rate and make up for it by eating too much at night (eg - 1 full standard bag of chips) because of this it would affect my pcos and then insulin and it becomes an ever ending cycle. 

When I am particularly anxious or burnt out I have no urge to eat which has been detrimental to my adult life — 10 years have gone by and I’ve not gotten much done with my life meanwhile my peers and friends with similar struggles have moved on and found strength and courage to push forward. 

I don’t think people at home take me seriously when I mention I may have an ED because they still continue with the fat jokes. I have a close friend who I love a lot, and grew up with and she’s always been slim and fit but since we were kids she’d always point out her “pot belly” and hate on it so much. I’ve always been the fat one but I know her comments are self directed but I feel like hearing that kind of dictated how I started to see my body as it was growing and changing. I still get triggered by it but I don’t have the guts to shoot it down, instead I try to keep it lighthearted. 

I do want to lose weight so my insulin levels are stabilized and my periods can regulate themselves but the biggest blockage in my future journey is my ongoing eating struggle. The anxiety doesn’t help, neither does me wanting to eat in privacy. 

I found strength training to be amazing for my body and mental health, but without the right eating habits I won’t be able to fuel my progress. My brother, someone who is very precise about things advised I use a scale to measure my portions but as I do that I’m worried I may trigger a new set of eating issues.

,EatingDisorders,"Like a lot of our diet-crazed parents my mother has always has a very strict relationship with food and unfortunately it has rubbed off on my brother [28M] and I [24F]. Ever since I can remember she always excessively complimented me for being naturally thin (which i think encouraged my food restrictions and severe body dysmorphia as a young adult) and berated my brother for being overweight. 

I was lucky in that I was able to move away in college and spent a lot of time in therapy, working on myself and building a healthier relationship with my body and food but my brother has not. He spent his college years living at home and sees my parents often and has very easily picked up that my mother’s opinions on food and fatphobia are fact and he is essentially hideous unless he loses weight. This absolutely breaks my heart. 

I have talked to her in the past about not making comments on my own body or commenting on what I eat, and mentioned the damage I was facing with my mental health and for a while the comments about me stopped but they have slowly picked up when I moved back close to home. In her opinion I am being too “sensitive” and that she is trying to help us.

But I’m sick of it and don’t know to get her to stop. Today we we’re taking family photos and my brother mentioned how he hates how he looks in photos and she told him “well youll look good once you lose the weight” (he is currently on a “diet” that consists of heavy calorie counting, skipping meals, and guilty binge-eating). He looked hurt and I told him that he already looked good to which he said “no i look fat”. I tried to console him saying “your weight does not make you unattractive, you look great already” and she started LAUGHING. I gave him a hug and she made a hand motion at his size and sarcastically said “yeah you look GREAT”. 

I’m fucking infuriated. I snapped at her and had to leave the room.

How do I approach this? i want him to know shes wrong and help him take care of himself in a healthy way but I don’t want to make him more self-conscious or uncomfortable and trigger him. I also am unsure how to talk to my mom about it since last time I tried she told me i was calling her a bad mother and got defensive. I think therapy might help him like it helped me but I don’t know how to bring that up lightly. Please help.

,EatingDisorders,"Today marks 2-YEARS E.D. free from my 16-year battle with that damn Bully! (bulimia)💪 
I’ve never known what if felt like to sincerely love my body until now.


In reality, MANY people battle relationships with food… like many, mine had nothing to do with weight, looks, counting calories, etc. 

I didn’t lose weight with it — my ED made my body look less physically fit when I relapsed too! 

THE PAIN of the aftermath (the total body bloat, nausea, stomach pain when trying to digest food later, etc.) was simply too much for me to handle anymore. 

I WANTED TO LOOK and FEEL HEALTHY, LEAN &amp; STRONG!

So, one day, I gather all the strength I had left and I finally made the choice to quit purging, once and for all. And I stuck to it by reminding myself that I couldn’t repair my metabolism if I didn’t stick to the mfing plan. 💯✊

My ED was the ONE THING in my incredibly dysfunctional childhood that I was able to control — and that control was ADDICTING. 🧠⚡️

I hated that it was my reality — No one truly understood, and almost no one even knew I had an issue. I battled it alone, without groups like Reddit, etc.
I was subconsciously humiliated that I couldn’t get ahold of myself… and I realize now that I thought no one would ever love such a broken being, so purposely I stayed single for 8-years (after divorcing my high school sweetheart in my early 20’s).

• I’ve never owned a scale; I don’t measure myself; I don’t beat myself up over the daily 5lbs that the body fluctuates.
• I eat very heathy, wholesome meals and I take herbal supplements; I exercise consistently &amp; I enjoy being active!

But still, that nagging voice in my head would occasionally take over and I’d sometimes relapse.😪 (And NOTHING feels worse than disappointing your own damn self! 🙄)

Now that I’ve come this far…
I’ve never looked or felt SO good. Even when I don’t  have as much time to exercise like I used to, I still feel great &amp; feel proud of myself overall. 🤍

,EatingDisorders,"Hi all,  I've recently started a sub dedicated to challenging lookism in Society. I suffer from body dysmorphia and developed binge eating disorder as a coping mechanism for trauma. I believe that we are victims of both our own psychology and society's unattainable aesthetic ideals.

Body image distortion is not a new phenomenon, but society's hyperfixation on beauty and body image has intensified the condition for many,  and worsened morbidity. Bdd and ed's are actually becoming more commonplace. Their prevalence is rising among adolescents.

Airbrushing, selfies and the normalisation of advanced photo editing tools are all , in part, responsible. The result is an escalation of body shaming, and self hatred. 

I started r/antilookism because of my BDD. It led me to self harm and suicide, and it has wrought mayhem in my life. I believe that, while neurology plays a part, we also have to challenge and question lookism in society, as this is a massive contributory factor. 

R/antilookism encompasses eating disorders, facial difference, bdd and the plus-sized. The idea is to create a space for activism and mutual support. 

I'm hoping that people will be able to use it to promote protests and matches. Certainly we have just cause to protest about appearance based discrimination in the workplace; the total lack of legislation and the media's perpetuation of beauty myths.

Society expects us to achieve a kind of aesthetic perfection.  For many of us  it is this impossible demand which led to our conditions. At r/antilookism  I'm hoping we'll be able to raise awareness.

,EatingDisorders,"Hey there, hope y'all are doing fine

Have any of you experienced this almost unbearable brain fog and tiredness during your recovery and how long did it last?

I just recently started to work full time again (in a cafe). I'm seriously feeling so drained all the time and I really cannot concentrate at all, I have ADHD anyway but it's never in my life been this bad. Sometimes when the customers talk to me my mind just wanders off and I have to ask them what they were saying or when they're ordering I noticed that I have trouble memorizing what they wanted (I used to work in restaurans before and it didn't happen to me in such a way, not even under severe pressure) or my supervisor tells me to get something which I don't know about yet and it's literally infront of me but I just don't grasp on it and the way I approach tasks is just so cumbersome and sloppy and don't get me started with mental arithmetic (I always sucked at it but still lol) I make many mistakes with the customers change that my supervisor had to point them out to me.

,EatingDisorders,"Cw: food, making food, not eating, food craving, health, food denial??

I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, and I'm not asking anyone here to confirm or deny the possibility or diagnose me. I am having an issue that I feel like this community may have experience with and could offer some advice.

I am having a hard time picking something to eat or making myself eat something that is not the food I am craving. Many days, I really really crave fast food, but I want to limit my intake due to health concerns. Diabetes runs rampant in my family and the older I get, the more concerned I am with the direction my health could go if I don't start eating foods more suited for diabetic or pre-diabetic people. Also, eating fast food all the time is expensive and I'm trying to save money. (I mean, look at this economy, amirite?) Additionally, I've realized that I've internalized some judgement now that my significant other and I are living together and they have never been one to eat fast food a lot. They are smaller and I am a big person. They've never judged me for my body size or commented negatively on what I eat, but I accidentally created a dialog in my head about it anyway. 

The problem is, if I can't eat what I'm craving, picking something else feels impossible. I feel frustrated and angry and sad that I'm not eating the thing I want to be eating. I want to cry. My partner tries to help by suggesting things I could make, but that honestly makes me even more frustrated and want to cry more. I SEE everything that I can make. I already have gone over every possible thing I could make in the house and none of them are going to replace what I really want to eat.

On top of this, whenever my partner leaves to visit parents or hike or something, I always immediately go out and get fast food. And then I freaking HIDE the evidence like I committed a CRIME or something.

On top of ALL of that, I have huge anxiety with cooking. So trying to foods, new recipes, etc is so stressful for me. I look at a recipe and I want to break down in tears. My mother never taught me how to cook so as an adult on my own, I've always ordered in or just ate chicken nuggets. I feel so inadequate compared to my partner whose family has always cooked meals at home.

I'm so lost. I've tried explaining some of this to my therapist but I don't think she understands or is qualified to offer coaching (on eating disorders??? That's what I'm starting to feel like this is becoming).

Although now I feel in good shape and look the best i’ve ever looked. I feel like I may be damaging my mental and physical health through eating.

,EatingDisorders,"It made me fat. 13 years of barely eating, Just only snacking on veg. And after a few years my body slowly started to gain weight, at uni I had an extreme blow up. So I went to work in the USA doing conservational physical work. I lost most of the weight (was still a healthy bmi)  but I stopped eating entirely. Just CHSP every day. 

My weight yo-yoed over the years and after travelling and loosing a lot more weight, the pounds piled back on. 
I was baffled how this could be when I WASN’T EATING 🤯

I had my metabolism checked at a university in london and my results were shocking. My RMR came back shockingly low, far less than what they calculated it should be. They said they would expect someone half my size to have a metabolism like this.

 I decided to start eating proper meals (for the first time in 13 years) to begin with, I felt like I gained a lot of weight but after a few weeks this levelled out (I believe it was water weight) I incorporated weight lifting and ate lots of protein and eventually I lost a bit of fat only a small amount and still a healthy BMI - but this time actually healthy for the first time in my life.

But here’s where I went wrong. I didn’t increase my calories enough. I still wasn’t eating enough and eventually that caught up with me. My body refused to lose any weight, I gained fat, yet eating half the amount I should be. My metabolism sped up slightly (as I weigh more) but now my body holds on to every bit of fat.

I decided enough is enough, my body needs to recover, I need to eat normally and I need to accept the weight gain that comes with it.

I weigh so much more, I’m very unhappy with the way I look but I’m happy with the energy I have, my sleep has improved!

If I could do it all over again, I would have recovered before my body started holding onto fat. Before my metabolism was utterly destroyed. I would have started gaining weight from the time I was skinny and not when I was already a normal weight 

If you want to be slim you have to eat. Because that my friends is what we were made to do.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi, I have struggled with disordered eating all my life.
In high school I became obsessive after a traumatic event and developed anorexic habits. After a year I couldn’t stand the comments and the low energy anymore so I started to eat again but this turned into binging. And that turned into taking laxatives. To this day I wonder if I severely impacted my health putting myself through all of this.

I remember being angry with my parents because I was obviously hurting and they couldn’t help me. As an adult I realize the eating habits they passed down to me and the environment that created for my eating disorder.

And now, I’m at my healthiest concerning my relationship with food, but I still get triggered by my parents comments. It is difficult to eat with them. They often eat large amounts of food in one sitting and designate (or justify) it “the meal of the day”. This is unhealthy because they will go long periods without eating and then eat something relatively unhealthy. They also have developed bully habits possibly out of insecurity and will make comments about how much food is left on some one else plate. Even mine- after all we have been through, they continue to make comments about what I choose to eat and how much I eat.

,EatingDisorders,"hey guys— i wasn’t sure where else to go, so i’m just popping by on here. i was wondering if i have an eating disorder, have disordered eating, or if what i do is sorta normal. 

i typically stick to one meal a day, and i usually eat less than a “healthy” (recommended) amount of calories when i do eat more. i don’t purge, but i do fast. the longest i’ve gone without eating is three days.

if i do binge (this is rare, maybe a couple times a month) i can eat about double the recommended caloric intake for someone and it’s all junk food (chocolate, chips, candies, pie, etc.) if you guys couldn’t tell, i count my calories.

it’s gotten to the point that my weight fluctuates a lot monthly. 

i have food guilt every single time (without fail) when i do eat— so much so that i’ve been contemplating purging via vomiting or dieter’s tea.

this all probably stems from food insecurity throughout my life and my mom’s own dieting habits.

i’ve told my psychiatrist about this before, but it was sorta waved off and not talked about in depth. 

i would just like some answers for some peace of mind.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi! My girlfriend's mom has always told her that she needs to look skinny and needs to eat less, and has basically a terrible parent her entire life. She always feels fat, and her family always tells her she looks fat, but she's actually super thin. In her last visit to the doctor, she was told that she's underweight by a fair amount. Even so, she barely eats. Most days she has only one, tiny meal. Today she had just one quesadilla and a cup of coffee. Because of this, she constantly has a headache, is super tired and dizzy, and sometimes she even passes out (these symptoms are probably related to her low blood iron and lupus). She also says she's not hungry.

I’m a 17f. I am very active in that I workout and play soccer. I ran cross country for several years, play outdoors with family and friends, and I spend lots of time in nature hiking, fishing, and kayaking. Because of all this, food intake is really important to me. I log everything I eat. I weigh foods out when I can, and I consult nutrition guides at restaurants. If I eat it, I will track it. I also weigh myself at least three times a day when I can. I know it’s not a good measure of how much I’ve actually gained or lost, but I track it because I want to know how it affects my performance. I am a healthy weight, and I don’t have plans on making big gains or cuts. Therefore, I try to keep my weight within 2 pounds of my preferred weight. If I’m up or down 2 pounds, I don’t see it as a problem as long as it starts trending back to where I want it. I think I’m done growing or at least close to it, so I don’t want to fluctuate too much anymore. I’m not bulimic or anorexic, I just monitor how much to take in very closely. 

Right now, I attend monthly talk therapy sessions for anxiety and depression. It’s been helpful to just talk things out with someone who won’t use my mental health against me. I just don’t know if talk therapy is helpful for how much I obsess over food. I think about it literally all the time, not in a way like I’m hungry, but I just can’t get it out of my mind sometimes.

,EatingDisorders,"Hey all,
I've been struggling with eating disorders for almost twelve years now and I've been in recovery for a little over a year.

It's going okay except that my hunger cues never really seem to settle. They're all over the place. I can get hungry but by the time I've walked over to the kitchen for a snack I'm full again. I will feel full after a meal, but I rarely feel fully satisfied - at the same time, I usually don't want to eat more still (does that make sense at all lol).

Specifically this happens; I will eat plenty of food and feel okay during the day. No cravings or strong hunger indications. However, as soon as I go to bed, I will get hungry. I will, without failure, wake up EVERY night at around 2am-4am and be hungry. Like, ravenously hungry. No matter how much I've eaten the day before. This interfers with my sleep and is generally unpleasant since I can't fall back asleep for a couple of hours.

For a while I would get up and eat, but that reinforced a bad circle of making me less hungry during the day and even more ravenous when I woke up during the night. This is how my binge eating episodes started, so I'd rather not keep doing that.

I am also at a normal weight and have been for a while, but I keep gaining weight which freaks me out a bit. I just keep eating more and more during the day to avoid waking up in the middle of the night, which always fails. I never feel like I can trust my hunger cues and I have a strong feeling that I will keep eating more and gain weight forever and it sucks.

For the record; I exercise and everything in my body is working (my period is back and regular after 10 years of absence and I'm not cold or losing hair or anything like that). I usually eat 5-6 meals a day spread out so I eat like every 2-5h. No calorie counting at all.

,EatingDisorders,"My girlfriend's been stuck with eating disorder for 6 years now. As I felt she was getting better, she told me recently that she feels like she's never gonna be able to escape this. She's always stuck in the same cycle : she deprives herself of eating what she wants, then when she eats what she wants she can't stop, she feels guilty so she deprives herself of eating what she wants and so on.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi Everyone,

By way of introduction - I'm a fourth-year Honours/ psychology student in Australia, with a personal interest in studying Eating Disorders due to how it has affected my life personally (and continues to affect it). 

As part of my university degree, we are currently conducting a study to investigate how one’s self-perception relates to Eating Disorder symptoms, as well as other psychological symptoms including emotion regulation, Obsessive Compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphia symptoms, and depression.

To be eligible, you must be aged 18 years or older and fluent in English. **You do NOT** need to have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or an Eating Disorder to participate.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone. I’m sorry this is kinda long. I’m really struggling. I have had binge eating disorder for several years, and I think I have ARFID (my whole life), but I haven’t talked to a doctor about it. I’ve started getting bad anxiety about my health because I eat almost no healthy foods. A lot of fruits and vegetables are hard for me to eat because of the texture so I eat a lot of junk food (especially chips and dip as my comfort/safe food). When I eat something that doesn’t bother me texture wise, but isn’t a comfort food, I also get a little nauseous and I end up not eating much and then binging later. I’m also overweight. I really want to eat healthy but trying to educate myself on healthy eating is triggering. I’m also a stay at home mom and it’s triggering to plan and cook all of my and my son’s meals. I started going to a therapist recently, and a couple days ago at my second session I brought up my anxiety around my BED and I think he’s one of the people who doesn’t really think it’s a real thing. I felt really shut down. I don’t really know how to go about getting treatment. 

There’s a really good mental health facility not far from my moms house that I went to as a teen for other struggles. I had a good experience. On their website it says they treat BED and ARFID. It surprised me and made me feel good that they take those things seriously. I’m open to going but they have different levels of treatment that make me nervous. Ranging from intensive outpatient to full hospitalization which it says usually lasts 1-3 months. Since I’m a stay at home mom I would be flipping my entire family’s lives upside down to do any sort of treatment there. Plus if I had to go the longer period of time I would miss so many of my son’s milestones since he’s only a year and a half old. And I have severe social anxiety so doing any level of inpatient scares me too. I’ll still go if that’s right for me though. I just want to be healthy. How do I know what the right route for me is?

So, they live quite far away and in the countryside, so we always stay for couple days whenever we go for a visit. I usually cook vegetarian or vegan food when I'm cooking for myself and my bf, but I eat whatever is served when I'm at someone else's place. I don't want to be a burden and ask for anything special, because I don't even have any diagnoses of a lactose intolerance etc.

His parents are nice and I love visiting them, but the amounts of red meat, sugary/salty/creamy food and carbs the mom cooks and bakes for us is too much for me. We always eat together so there's no way I'd be able to skip anything. Once I tried to cut myself a smaller piece of pork ribs and his dad immediately commented on that. Feels like they expect me to eat the same amount as everyone else in the household (they only have adult sons, and his mom is obese). His mom usually has prepared at least two to three different kinds of cakes and/or pies for afternoon snack. She always adds extra sugar or salt to whatever she cooks or bakes. And every time there's still some food left, the dad pressures us to take another round and eat it all so it wouldn't go to waste. Since bingeing seems to be enabled and encouraged, I end up eating more than I normally do. Sometimes I continue to binge at home as well, because the cravings get out of control.

After the long weekend of eating all that, I get VERY bloated. And when I'm very bloated, I get the urge to start restricting very heavily. Now that I think of it, my longest and ""the worst"" restrictive episode was right after coming home from his parents three years ago.

Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you manage to overcome it?

And every time there&amp;#39;s still some food left, the dad pressures us to take another round and eat it all so it wouldn&amp;#39;t go to waste. Since bingeing seems to be enabled and encouraged, I end up eating more than I normally do. Sometimes I continue to binge at home as well, because the cravings get out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the long weekend of eating all that, I get VERY bloated. And when I&amp;#39;m very bloated, I get the urge to start restricting very heavily. Now that I think of it, my longest and &amp;quot;the worst&amp;quot; restrictive episode was right after coming home from his parents three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you manage to overcome it? I feel uncomfortable telling his mom about my problems, because I feel like she wouldn&amp;#39;t understand and maybe even take it as an insult. I hate having this battle in my head for weeks after every time we visit them..&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hi, so basically I have suffered with multiple eating disorders for around 5 years now and have had multiple relapses and never truly recovered. However, now I am truly choosing recovery

It started with a 'diet' which lead to anorexia and bingeing. This then spiralled into continuous binges so I got help at the hospital and the bingeing stopped, however I feel like I never truly recognised my hunger for years after that and would just eat whenever I felt like it and kind of overate, leading to weight gain. This weight gain caused me to go back onto a diet, spiralling back into disordered eating patterns and ana. Anyways, I believe I am recovering well from ana as I no longer aspire to lose weight and try not to body check and am at a normal weight now, however I still stress about when to eat.

I have started intuitive eating and I can feel hunger and fullness cues when I am distracted and not anxious, however when I am left alone with my thoughts I am constantly thinking when next I should eat and it sort of leads me to overeat cos its like my brain tricks me into emotional hunger. Also, I could be hungry however my appetite goes as the stress of deciding if im actually hungry or not causes me anxiety and guilt.

I have gone back to the gym as I do want to lead a healthy lifestyle and stay in shape, however do not count calories and eat what I crave as long as I am hungry (I try but still sometimes overeat).

Anyways, my question is how do I get out of this quasi recovery and stop thinking and stressing about food, like I am not trying to lose weight, I guess you could say I am trying to suppress drastic weight gain but isn't that normal? I just want to make sure I am healthy but feel like I am self-sabotaging myself. I feel like because I've been eating out a lot recently I have gained a bit of weight and that isn't the norm for me to eat out that much but it has triggered me.

Maybe I need to completely stop body checking but I am trying but I feel stuck on how to have the mindset of 'I eat what feels good to me,' as my anxiety causes me to think 'what if that causes you to gain loadssss of weight?' 

I just want to know how to brush off these thoughts after I eat and be able to focus on other things?

Recently, however, I've really been struggling with things like knowing when to stop eating but similarly knowing when it's an appropriate time to honour my hunger if that makes any sense?

I yo-yo'd with binging and restricting over the years so I have struggles on both sides, something I'm sure many of you can relate with. The past restriction has triggered a sense of fear in me when it comes to feeling hungry; if I feel hungry my brain gets scared I'm slipping back into those bad habits which then triggers a binge and so the cycle continues. 

My problem at the moment, because life has gotten so busy (and is only getting busier) I'm worried that I'll fall back into the full trap of it as I now has so much LESS time to really focus on it all.

,EatingDisorders,So for at least 2+ years my girlfriend has been doing things to loose weight. At first it was missing a meal to then not eating for a day and so on but for the past year and a half she’s started doing worse things like making herself sick after most if not every meal and counting calories and working out an extreme amount.

There’s also times when she’s not eating and everything else where she wants to get help and we talk and see what’s going to help her best what I can do what she needs to do and so on but then the next day she could just switch and refuse any sort of help.

I hate myself. It makes my current food struggles so much worse, I feel like the fat sister, the out of control one and I hate being out of control! I am still living at home and I wish I could leave to live with my boyfriend but I&amp;#39;ll be stuck here at least for the next 6 months to a year. I cannot cope. Someone help.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hi all,  
I've been in recovery from EDnos for a few months now and it's going generally okay, only lately I have absolutely no appetite most days. It started with the most recent heatwave -- I don't usually feel like eating a huge amount when it's hot (and I know a lot of non-disordered people who say the same), but even as it's cooled down I just have barely any interest in food. When I do feel like eating I only feel like eating something bland and flavourless. I did order pizza with a friend the other day, and could stomach it at the time, but my usual favourite foods are not enticing me at all and I generally feel sort of queasy all day too.   


I'm just wondering if this sounds like I might be subconsciously relapsing or if anyone else has experienced this, and am just after some general advice please.  


For the record, I see a therapist every week and wouldn't say I'm depressed right now, I take my medication daily, as I'm supposed to and really can't work out what's making me feel this way :(

,EatingDisorders,"hi, i’m a teen that’s been battling a restrictive ED for two years now. it’s been a tough and tiring internal battle with myself and it hasn’t gotten much better, in fact i relapsed recently :(

i always compare what i eat to my sister, who’s about the same size as me. even small things like if i ate a banana and she didn’t is enough to send my mind into complete disarray. coupled with my short temper, i can’t control or express my illogical feelings very well and this often results in outbursts of anger. 

hence ive been told many times to control my temper better. though i agree i have a short fuse, but i can’t help but think my ED has a part to play and that it isn’t completely my fault. i feel abit wronged and blamed sometimes for something i can’t control. or maybe i’m just not trying hard enough to control my temper? i’m so confused and frustrated. all i can do is say okay, sorry.

and another thing is my condition fluctuates every other day. some days i’m like i’m way too underweight, if i don’t do this for my body i’ll never be healthy or have my period back again. while on other days i’m just busy comparing myself to my sister and eating less than i really should be. i don’t know how to focus on myself and not on other’s food.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi, my much older sister, F55, has struggled with secret eating and binging for as long as I remember.

(Trigger warning: this post contains talk about weight, no numbers are mentioned, body image, mentions of behaviors such as calories counting, purging, excessive exercising, binging. Stay safe!)

Hi! I'm Lillith, just to put down some context, I'm a minor, undiagnosed, and while I can't officially say that I have an ED, it's pretty obvious that I do. My ED kinda consists of what I call ""phases"" I have a phase where I'm full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. Then the other is binging. It doesn't stsy long (a week or so) and doesn't happen often, it's triggered when I don't get food I'm body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, I then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. Sometimes when I have no choice I eat like a ""normal person"" but try to burn it off by exercising (I do at home biking and sometimes sit-ups). What triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. I had gained a lot during the summer bc I did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, I shed the pounds naturally when I got back to school because I would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn't snake at school. (TW: Numbers/talk about my weight) So I went from an average weight in August, to a low-average weight in November. Then I started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school (my friends called them my fangirls) they would say I was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you're so thin! That's so cool! 
I crave compliments, affection, I want to keep it forever, I have a past with bullying and parents I disappointed cuz I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until 8th grade (so really). I would rarely get compliments, so now I do everything to keep them. While I was someone who didn't want to care about they way I looked because I knew I was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. My mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack ""be careful you're going to end up like this summer""
I slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of being underweight made its way into my head. So here was the starting point of my ED. Now I'm kinda deep into it but it's summer break so skipping meals is hard, I try to exercise, I skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don't so I can't. But I also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. 
Here's the thing, I don't like throwing up, but that didn't stop me from trying to make myself purge, I've never been able to though. Until today, I was trying to purge but couldn't, I went on internet, searched ""how to make yourself puke"" found something, tried it once, succeeded. I did about three times until I just couldn't bc I still don't like to throw up. I exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. I felt the dizziness I feel when ""it's working"" I'm used to it and it's strangely satisfying since I associate it with weight loss. The purging too, while I still don't like to puke, I had this feeling of satisfaction. 

Now, I don't know what to think about this... did I just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ED? Or is it just me being dramatic about it, and I probably won't pick up on this behavior? Searching for some advice :)

,EatingDisorders,"Ever since i moved out of my parents house when i was 18, ive been struggling w money. When id pay for my apartment and car (i lived alone so all the bills were mine alone), i wouldnt have enough money to go to the grocery store for food. Consequently, i lost the habit of going to the grocery store; id mainly eat fast food or go to my dads for dinner. Food was no longer considered a necessity to me. Now, i have a better job with great pay, but i still cant bring myself to buy groceries. I might just be lazy, but even home cooked meals made by friends or family dont seem appetizing. If they do, i can only take a few bites before im finished. i feel like my health is in bad shape because of this. I wake up feeling starving to the point i feel like puking or fainting.

Consequently, i lost the habit of going to the grocery store; id mainly eat fast food or go to my dads for dinner. Food was no longer considered a necessity to me. Now, i have a better job with great pay, but i still cant bring myself to buy groceries. I might just be lazy, but even home cooked meals made by friends or family dont seem appetizing. If they do, i can only take a few bites before im finished. i feel like my health is in bad shape because of this. I wake up feeling starving to the point i feel like puking or fainting.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi, I need support, and there is nobody in my life I can even tell about this, so I am here. Back in 2015, I was diagnosed with anorexia. I lost a ton of weight in one year and was eating under 1/4 calories i should have been eating a day while working out every single day. At my lowest, I could see my ribs and was overall in really bad health. My mother, who I lived with at the time, was completely freaking out and made me watch slideshows looking at people dying of anorexia to force me to eat more. It did not work, but what did work was my school counselor coming to me and telling me that some teachers were worried about me and asked her to talk to me. I listened. It took a while to accept that I was anorexic, but I eventually did and gradually got better over the next three years.

Fast forward to now. I am married and have given birth to two kids (only one living), I am full-time in nursing school and working part-time, my husband got laid off and hasn't been able to find work, and I can't deal. Since having my last child, I have been trying to lose weight healthily, but all the stressors in my life conglomerated into a nervous breakdown. On top of that I still have major body dysmorphia. Over the course of the past 4 months, I have gained weight due to stress eating, making me now overweight. During that time, I started binging and purging. It's gotten to the point that I can't eat a big meal without feeling like I must throw up afterward, and I feel like I complete failure if I can't. I've managed to hide this from my family, but I can't keep living like this. I need to get a healthy relationship with food and get down to a healthy weight without being hospitalized.

Hi all - for background, I am currently in IOP following an AN relapse. I’ve been at my current program for a month and a half and have made some really good progress, but I’ve also somewhat plateaued and am still engaging in a range of ED behaviors. My treatment team is recommending I spend a couple weeks at a HLOC as sort of a tune up/jump start as they feel discharging me with my current frequency using certain behaviors could be very risky. I am a student, and they’re concerned that without extra intervention I’ll backslide at the start of the school year.  

Me and my outpatient team were all somewhat surprised by this suggestion as I have generally been eating adequate amounts each day even with some restriction/compulsive exercise (for example, might restrict at a meal but overall intake for the day is good, or might make ED driven food choices but they still minimally meet my meal plan, or do some compulsive exercise but at low frequency/intensity). My outpatient team basically said this would be a somewhat unusual step up in treatment bc it wouldn’t be the result of me doing super badly in IOP but instead a sort of safeguard/method to get me doing even better and get out of this “stuck” zone. IOP team confirmed that I’m very compliant and engaged and that a some things are going well, they just see areas I’m still struggling and that they think would be good to improve. My OP team definitely hasn’t discouraged me from trying a HLOC but agreed with me that it might not be necessary and that this is ultimately my choice based on what I think will help me and whether I’m willing to engage with the process. I’m not opposed to trying a HLOC for a short period because I really truly want to recover, but I’m also concerned being at a HLOC will surround me with people who are much sicker in a way that will be really distressing or something. I also feel a bit resentful towards my IOP team that what im doing now isn’t “good enough” and don’t like the idea of putting myself in a position with less autonomy.

Has anyone been in this position before? If so, how did you respond? Or if not, suggestions after reading through my ramble? 

I also want to acknowledge that, as someone with an ED, I am by definition not an objective judge of my behavior bc I’m biased towards minimizing and my ED fights very hard to maintain it’s control.

&lt;p&gt;I also want to acknowledge that, as someone with an ED, I am by definition not an objective judge of my behavior bc I’m biased towards minimizing and my ED fights very hard to maintain it’s control. I think a lot of my confusion/indecision now is because my OP team agrees this isn’t absolutely necessary, which has left me uncertain how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hey y’all, just posting this in hopes to find some tips/advice on how to deal with bulimic tendencies. 

I (25F) have been bulimic for a few years now. I was never skinny nor was I obese, but more so on the “skinny fat” spectrum. My bulimia wasn’t that serious when I first started, but it’s been getting worst, especially this past 6 months. 

Due to Covid lockdowns and work stress, my appetite started to get reaaaaalllly small around this time last year, and I was at my skinniest. 

Beginning of this year, a lot of my friends were moving out of the country, so I started to go out to eat with them more and do a lot more farewell lunches/dinners. Long story short, I gained weight. 

It definitely sucks to see myself go from my skinniest, to the state that I am now. I try not to let the numbers on the scale affect me too much, as I have been working out more and I do see myself tiring on some muscles. Regardless,there’s still a lot of body fat on me and it definitely isn’t something I enjoy seeing. 

Nowadays, I notice myself eating late at night (after eating “pretty good” meals all day) because i’m craving certain tastes rather than foods (savory snacks/sweets). Sooner or later, I’d find myself in a state where I feel absolutely disgusted with myself and end up purging. 

Before I trail off and gab on more about it, my point is  -I want to stop myself from snacking and truly stick to a diet that could help me lose fat and build muscle.

,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone,

*I’m a college student who’s very worried about the intense hunger I’ve experienced since end of April*.

For context, I began going on a diet starting November of last year. I set a limit on calorie intake (I'm not including a specific number, but it's around the lower bound of recommended intake for an adult woman). At first, I could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. I started to have binging episodes once a week. There’s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2-3AM I would go there and buy candy and chips. Feeling guilty, I tried to eat very little the next day.

During winter break, I ate almost the same food items for breakfast and then nothing else for the rest of the day. When school resumed, I tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. The foods I ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them.

Towards the end of march, I decided to end my terrible ‘dieting’ practices. I began eating as much as I wanted. But I soon noticed that I almost never felt full. No matter how much I ate for every meal and snack, I wanted to eat more. My constant hunger intensified in May, and ever since I would eat as much as two or three meals’ worth of food for each meal.

I’m writing because I’m concerned about my health; I eat so much that I continue to rapidly gain weight, and I’m worried this will eventually lead to obesity. I am nearing being overweight in the BMI range .

I feel like I didn’t restrict to an extreme degree while I was dieting. Consequently, I don’t understand why I’m experiencing such intense hunger for such a long time. My lab results also don’t indicate any underlying medical condition.

,EatingDisorders,"I’m sorry if this post seems a little incoherent, English os not my first language and I’m on the verge of a breakdown but I feel like I need my worries out there, somewhere, you know?

I’ve been eating just fine for almost two years, I had been hospitalised a few times, I go to a therapist every other week, I don’t feel the urge to go back to my previous behaviour, I’m fine with my weight, I’m fine with myself, I’ve made friends with myself. However, I feel like that obsession and self-hatred had turned towards my former struggles with eating, as in ""What had I done to myself?"" kind of thing, I ruined my guts, my body, my teeth. That was all me. I feel embarrassed and gross and like I don’t deserve nice things.

I started struggling with eating disorder as a child (I was already severely underweight before), at first I wasn’t eating, but I started having binge-purge episodes a year and a half later, multiple times a day, for years. The lack of energy from not getting proper nutrition mixed with depression often made me neglect my personal hygiene as well.

I’ve recently gotten an inflammation in my tooth, I have an infection going all the way to the bone. And it just hit me. I don’t believe I have a single healthy tooth in my mouth. I feel disgusting, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to fix this.

And the thing is, I also met someone, they’re honestly amazing and I like them a lot, It seems like a may actually have a shot at a healthy relationship and I don’t want to lose it. But I can feel my skin crawl and the thought of kissing them while having teeth like mine. I’m getting a procedure for my inflammation in October, which seems so far away. But even after that, how can I ever let myself feel loved when I just feel gross and dirty all the time? I don’t even think I can kiss them, I’m scared, I ’m scared that it turns them off, and I just think they deserve someone who isn’t rotting.

When I’m trying to look up other people with EDs’ concerns about their teeth, they’re all about how they’ve always took the best care of their teeth and how they’re embarrassed about getting their first ever cavity while I’m reading it with a mouth full of them and I don’t want to invalidate their issues but it makes me want to blow my head off.

How can I ever come to terms with this? When it’s something objectively bad? And when it’s all my fault?

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been eating just fine for almost two years, I had been hospitalised a few times, I go to a therapist every other week, I don’t feel the urge to go back to my previous behaviour, I’m fine with my weight, I’m fine with myself, I’ve made friends with myself. However, I feel like that obsession and self-hatred had turned towards my former struggles with eating, as in &amp;quot;What had I done to myself?&amp;quot; kind of thing, I ruined my guts, my body, my teeth. That was all me. I feel embarrassed and gross and like I don’t deserve nice things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started struggling with eating disorder as a child (I was already severely underweight before), at first I wasn’t eating, but I started having binge-purge episodes a year and a half later, multiple times a day, for years. The lack of energy from not getting proper nutrition mixed with depression often made me neglect my personal hygiene as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently gotten an inflammation in my tooth, I have an infection going all the way to the bone. And it just hit me. I don’t believe I have a single healthy tooth in my mouth. I feel disgusting, I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing is, I also met someone, they’re honestly amazing and I like them a lot, It seems like a may actually have a shot at a healthy relationship and I don’t want to lose it. But I can feel my skin crawl and the thought of kissing them while having teeth like mine. I’m getting a procedure for my inflammation in October, which seems so far away. But even after that, how can I ever let myself feel loved when I just feel gross and dirty all the time? I don’t even think I can kiss them, I’m scared, I ’m scared that it turns them off, and I just think they deserve someone who isn’t rotting.&lt;/p&gt;

This might be a long shot, but does anyone know of any apps like this? Looking for something I can go to when I have binge cravings, want to eat for no reason, or eat poorly, etc.

Or document how I feel. But question me, you sure you want to do this, you're stronger than this, walk away, think of hat far you've come etc.

I really think I'm need something like this. I'm trying to do it myself mentally, but I've been failing. I lost 120 pounds and the scale is slowly creeping up again, and I'm struggling to not give into these urges. Harder than it was before for some reason.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi, this will be a long one and I really hope I can get some help. At the start of the pandemic, something happened that never happened before-I started getting disgusted at the idea of food and just avoided it as much as I could but still ate when pushed. However it was honestly not something I wanted to do. It was the idea of chewing food, for some reason, that almost made me angry. I was under a  lot of stress then because of the pandemic and I was worried about courses in university to the extent where I felt like my life was being stolen from me (obviously other issues were there). Basically, it was an exceptional situation. However, I have noticed that since then (2 years back) I have developed a habit of periodically not knowing what to eat and feeling ashamed about it because no food excites me or I just don't want to eat at all. I eat so I don't get hunger pangs. 

Strange thing is, previously, whenever I got nervous, I overate because food comforted me. I loved and still love food. In fact, in the past, I ate so much I felt sick at times and there were even times when I vomited (also unhealthy, I know. I guess I've had a shit relationship with food for a while now). I never caused a fuss about food and for decades ate the same thing without complaint, but now at 24 I have moments where I feel irritated at food overall. I feel embarrassed because this feels like such a petty issue to have. Thankfully it hasn't been as severe as the first episode when I ended up losing 8 kgs within 2 months (only noticed when other people told me I looked much thinner because I was just not in the right state of mind). 

Anyway, when I recovered, I started intermittent fasting as part of a strict routine that included language learning, bullet journaling, exercising, etc to whip myself out of a funk and dropped 7 more kgs over 5-6 months. All was fine. My parents were always stick thin and still are so I was the odd one out cause my sister is super thin too. I wasn't too bothered by it because I was in a very competitive school and there were far too many things already giving me pressure. I used to be over 10kgs overweight and am now at a weight considered healthy (65kg, 5ft 5 inch). Obviously like many girls my age I wanted to be thin very badly when I was young but with many other kinds of pressures I kind of forgot about it and I was never the kind of girl who was able to starve myself. 

Now however, I suddenly get mad at food or having to eat cause it feels like such an insurmountable task, I don't know why. **What I noticed is, this happens every time I'm stressed. It's like I take the rage out on food and eating just feels like another task that must be completed or else.**

Other info-I was suicidal twice within a span of 4 years and I have recovered both times quite well though the experience was excruciating. I also have a bit of an issue with anxiety and sometimes anger. But if I may say so myself, I'm pretty strong and am a fighter. Just worried about my sudden disgust of food that pops up at times because I will be living alone soon and know it isn't healthy. Asking for advice here cause I live in a developing country where some therapists literally tell you to pray your problems away and even if you find a good one, there is heavy social stigma. Also I think most aren't trained for this kind of thing. Advice and tips would be highly appreciated.

At the start of the pandemic, something happened that never happened before-I started getting disgusted at the idea of food and just avoided it as much as I could but still ate when pushed. However it was honestly not something I wanted to do. It was the idea of chewing food, for some reason, that almost made me angry. I was under a  lot of stress then because of the pandemic and I was worried about courses in university to the extent where I felt like my life was being stolen from me (obviously other issues were there). Basically, it was an exceptional situation. However, I have noticed that since then (2 years back) I have developed a habit of periodically not knowing what to eat and feeling ashamed about it because no food excites me or I just don&amp;#39;t want to eat at all. I eat so I don&amp;#39;t get hunger pangs. &lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"I am in an incredible dilemma at the moment. I just graduated college in May, and I've been interviewing for jobs over the summer. I just got a phone call today with an incredible job offer that I would normally be so thrilled about (I still am so excited by the prospect of it), would be a great start to my career, and is for a cause I really care about. Notably, though, it will be a fast-paced, time-consuming position, and I would be moving away from my family and friends to take it.

I've also been struggling with a relapse into my anorexia for about 2 years now. I was on the path back to recovery for a while last year, and then backslid this spring and have been slowly declining again, and my doctor and therapist are recommending I seek residential treatment -- in fact, I'm on a waitlist and would probably get admitted in the next couple of weeks. I just heard from my doctor today that my bloodwork came back with alarmingly low glucose, along with some other concerning results. I don't feel the symptoms of any of this -- I never experience low blood sugar symptoms, apparently because my body has adjusted to it. I know I've lost weight but it's not in a dire place -- I don't need to be hospitalized or anything like that. I'm getting by, and still eating every meal/snack, just probably too little of them. I'm not crashing and burning or anything like that.

So I'm at a really terrible crossroads here: option 1 is to accept the job offer and do what I need to do through outpatient treatment, get a dietician and a meal plan and try to keep myself stable (and ideally on an upward path) as I work this job. Fortunately, my doctor is actually located in the city I would be moving to, so I would actually be closer to him and excellent dietician options. Option 2 is to turn down my first, pretty-much-perfect job offer of adulthood and commit to going to residential whenever a spot opens up, and then explore other options once I get out and am more stable.

,EatingDisorders,"When low rise pants were popular, my pants were already riding lower, showing a little bit more crack than what might be considered cute. i was a bigger kid. other kids noticed, and they made me aware of it too. i think growing up in a bigger body makes you feel like you don’t deserve the desirability associated with smaller bodies. 

i used to hate the doctors office. the scale would continue to rise so many pounds every year, and the doctor never failed to suggest that I increase my “fruit and vegetable intake”. i would leave with the sheet of my BMI face down in the dashboard of my mom’s volvo, hoping that she wouldn’t bring it up after our next meal. 

i had great friends in high school. great friends. we laughed so hard and were so content with each other, i never even noticed that no men liked me. when it came time to being asked to dances, I was always the last to have a date. my friends were nice enough to pair me with a friend of theirs, but i always felt like such a burden as their heavier escort. 

Going to visit my nana in Arizona felt like being a steak being inspected at the meat packing docks. My 5’ 10 Nana would insert her exact weight that she weighed when she was married. I would smile and continue to cover the rolls of my stomach with my arms while i sat on her corduroy couch. When we went swimming she would tell me that I needed to slim down, and I would stay behind and let the others go ahead. I would reflect on how unlucky I was to be so ugly. If nana said it, it must be how others saw me too. 

My freshman of college was one of the worst years of my life. girls wanted pretty roommates to meet Sigma Chi’s. I felt like a burden to my dorm floor for wasting so much space with my larger body. I hated the way guys ignored me, i hated the way I looked in the mirrors of college library, but i loved the way snacks comforted my freshman sorrows. 

The summer after freshman year, i wanted to prove them wrong. I wanted to feel noticed. I heard about the keto diet and how it had worked wonders for a family friend. I took a deep dive and only ate meat and dairy that whole summer. I did not allow for a single speck of brown sugar to fall near my spoon. I started walking and held strict to my regimen.

People noticed. I was receiving praise for my hard work, and this time it was personal. I felt like i was finally being seen. I returned to my sorority house and was suddenly well liked. I had my first fling and loved the idea of someone liking me, and my exterior! 

In the ball pit of praise and compliments to my (extremely) thin stature, there was a girl screaming for help. 

I had completely forgotten what it was like to walk up the stairs without the feeling of fainting. I had forgotten the taste of fruit. I had cried when my mom marinated the chicken in teriyaki. The diet won. I had signed my soul away to be what i believed was beautiful. I was thin!!!! I was disintegrating into half of who i deserved to be.

The next year was spent miserably alone in covid. I would either eat the entire house and it’s packaging, or nothing at all for days. There was no in between and my life felt out of control. A horrible year and summer. But nobody noticed. Nobody cared because I was a healthy weight. I had good grades, and I smiled when people greeted. 

At the end of summer 2021 I was saved. I was invited to a friends lake house in South Carolina. We went hiking and swimming and the most revolutionary idea was introduced to me. They all ate breakfast. Each day, every one there had something to eat. Whether it was toast and eggs, yogurt bowls or avocado toast. All of them recognized the value in eating, even if they weren’t expiring from hunger. They all ate cake at night and woke up the next day looking the same. I was beginning to see the way life could be. A life not consumed by food. 

I spent the next year in recovery. I am still in recovery. I love lunch. I love snacks. I love getting up from bed and feeling strong, not lightheaded. I love experiences and I will never limit my social calendar because of my diet. I won? I am happier now. Happy as I could be as a girl growing up bigger.

,EatingDisorders,"Hello,

Here is some background on my weight throughout the years. 

As a child, I was always thin. I would get bullied from boys and girls about not having “an ass” or for being too thin. It really upset me. I always wanted to be thicker. 

I had gone through a lot in my childhood, and especially my early young adult years. A four year toxic and abusive relationship with my first love, he cheated on me with about twenty women (that I know of) and I always blamed it on my skinniness even though the issue was he was a narcissistic alcoholic that gaslit me - though the stress he put me through made me lose more weight, and the drugs i started using didnt help.

I left him in in twenty-eighteen to go to rehab in CA. I was very underweight from drugs. I gained a LOT of weight there and I was actually very happy with that. I stayed out there after rehab and had a great time on my own. But I started to become really unhappy with my weight as time went on. I moved back home with my family in Chicago in october two years back and began to lose weight unintentionally.

Today I am again underweight. I get constant comments. I feel guilty eating at work no matter how hard I try to put it down. I buy thousands of dollars in groceries and takeout every month, and it all rots. I like people to see me with food, to avoid concern but I usually take two bites and throw it away. I only ever feel comfortable eating in bed alone. 

I “forget” to eat and most days put down barely any calories. I hate looking at myself, i always wear baggy clothes. I try to workout to gain muscle but it never works. i cry dailyabout my weight. Talking about food gives me anxiety. I only want to eat fat on meat, cheeses, some carbs and fruit. Even when I know I am hungry, I usually vape or drink caffiene and my appetite goes away. Its so strange because I want to gain weight but I feel like I subconsciously prevent myself from doing so. I am considering checking into an inpatient facility because my mental health is in shambles. I am emotionally crippled from my own thoughts and my job. I just am so confused but I want help, and maybe I just need someone to tell me I have an eating disorder because I have a hard time believing that I do.

However, ever since my ED I have had consistent, everyday bloating. I'm talking like waking up and going to bed the same amount of bloated. Has anyone else ever experienced this?

,EatingDisorders,"TW: Talk about disordered behaviors and thoughts 

So I'm a twenty year old female and I've been told by a counselor before that they think I have an eating disorder, but I have never received an actual diagnosis. (They said that they weren't specialized enough to give a diagnosis) This lack of clarification is making me very confused as to what I should do next (whether it urgently needs to be taken care of, where I should go, what level of treatment if I need if I go, ect...) 

Honestly, I am not even sure if it is just one disorder, or if it even fits a category of an eating disorder. 

You see I have always been underweight with poor eating habits like taking hours to eat food, hiding food so I didn't have to eat it, ect... But my eating has gotten significantly worse as I have grown older. I eat around one to one-and-a-half meals which can easily take me hours to finish (reach a point where I am satisfied but not full and stop eating), a very low appetite/lack of interest in eating most foods, with food intolerances to top it off. This is what I call ""normal eating"", or my version of ""intuitive eating"". I am not consciously forcing myself to not eat. 

But when I was fourteen, I started getting extremely stressed and overwhelmed and developed periods of ""restrictive eating"". Now when ever I get stressed or overwhelmed it triggers these restricting periods as a sort of coping mechanism. During these periods, I am purposefully restricting, counting calories, weighing myself, ect... Think common AN symptoms. Once the stressful situation lessens or ends these behaviors I have lessen and I go back to a ""normal period"" until the next stressful/overwhelming situation occurs. 

All of my bad eating ""habits"" over the past several years have accumulated into me reaching a very low weight. I keep having this pressing feeling that I should get help from professionals, but I am a college student without a lot of money. Plus the fall semester is going to start soon and I don't think that will mesh well with ""time intensive treatment"". (And while I have this feeling that I need to do something my family doesn't seem worried so I gets me thinking that maybe I am just overreacting?) 

If you guys have any next step advice, treatment recommendations/suggestions, if I you think I even have an eating disorder or if I'm just overreacting, or an outside/different perspective on what is happening... I would be more that happy for the help and advice!

,EatingDisorders,"ok so i’m going to have to give a bit of context so you can understand where i’m coming from, the first thing to know going into this is that my mum is a therapist. 

i have been struggling with anorexia (which turned into bed/bulimia then back to anorexia now) for almost 2 years now i believe, and my mum has been aware of it for a huge part of that. she’s taken me to camhs appointments, weigh ins and everything, has spoken to school etc so she knows it’s an issue and yet i still feel like she’s not taking it seriously or doesn’t even believe it’s a problem. she used to be more concerned when i was extremely underweight, but due to the binging i have gone back up to a healthy weight (although have started to lose it again).

to give an example, today i had a really awful body image/dysmorphia day and couldn’t find a single thing to wear without crying for the best part of an hour. i told my mum eventually (through tears) that i just felt horrible and disgusting in everything i was wearing and didn’t think i could go out and rather than do anything to help or comfort me she just fell asleep. literally just slept on the sofa and refused to help at all. and then in the car decided to tell me that she thought i only did all that because i was pissed off with her (obviously not true). she’s also the type of parent who as soon as you say one negative thing or ask that she stops doing something that upsets you or whatever, she will just turn it around on her and start saying that’s she’s a bad parent, or that i hate her or whatever so i don’t know how to talk to her about what i’m struggling with without that happening.

i’m moving to uni at the end of september/beginning of october so i won’t be here much longer but i would really like her to just be able to understand what i’m going though and that it’s really difficult, you would think as a therapist she would understand but evidently not. anyway, i just don’t know what to say without it causing a huge argument but shit like what happened today just really impacts me and i don’t know how much more i can take of it.",t2_6grjsxya,False,,0,False,how do you talk to a parent about your ED?,[],r/EatingDisorders,False,0.0,one,0,,,False,t3_w1hxnu,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1658093249.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.EatingDisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;ok so i’m going to have to give a bit of context so you can understand where i’m coming from, the first thing to know going into this is that my mum is a therapist. &lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone, I think I developed a problem, and I am here seeking your clarification on what I should do about it. Consider this a TW, I don’t want to put any reader in a position of wanting to restrict their diet again. 

Anyways, I’ve always had body image issues. Im a male, 19. I am in recovery from substance abuse, I lost a lot of weight then, but after going to long-term treatment I gained all that weight back plus a bunch more. As I was delving into my recovery lifestyle, I became obsessed with the gym and eating accordingly. First red flag, that I thought was healthy. My mother told me that she thought it was a “healthy addiction” which I guess considering my previous addiction, she said out of fear of my relapse to that.

Here is when things start getting bad. I took on a houseframing/carpentry job, and got in a habit of eating just one meal a day, because eating out on the job was undesirable. I left the job because I hated those people, and the way they treated me. But, my eating habits remained the same because I had already become accustomed to it. In fact, I noticed I had more energy to spare since I wasn’t working all day anymore. I became exhilarated by thought of potential weight loss, and used that energy to restrict my diet even more. I felt excited by how much of an “I’m on a roll!” feeling I had. 

I remain in this mindset today. My diet is habitually restricted to one small meal a day. I don’t want to diagnose myself, my therapist is extremely concerned but I haven’t seen him in a month, and he was concerned then. He told me that men are also likely to develop eating disorders, and that it needs more attention, knowing that, is why I feel comfortable approaching this sub, otherwise I would feel hesitant because I wouldn’t want to receive any comment on my gender orientation and its affect on the possibility of my eating disorder.

,EatingDisorders,"Hello. I have a friend who has trouble eating both regularly and in normal quantities. As if it wasn't worrying enough, it appears to be getting worse for no apparent reason. 

It started a few years ago. It began with him working for long hours and not taking food to work, so he ended up staying without food from 7AM to 6PM. He felt fine, so he just kept on doing that. 

Eventually he stopped working for so long, but nowadays he still has very low appetite and can't manage seemingly small portions of food for his weight a lot of the time. Hell, he can easily go without eating for two whole days and feel relatively fine. Stressful situations make this even worse.

What baffles us even more is the fact that he started working out regularly and yet it hasn't made him crave for more food at all, let alone for protein-rich dishes. In fact it's after this that his appetite started to get worse.

**This seems like an important detail:** when he does finally decide to eat something, he is likely to lose appetite from looking at the food that is ready to be eaten.

Despite all this his weight overall is just a little lower than normal, albeit it fluctuates back and forth often, and he doesn't seem to be gaining any muscle mass from going to the gym.

,EatingDisorders,"Currently, I'm a 30 year old male, and weigh just about what would be considered healthy for my height. Around 10 years ago, I was much more overweight and miserable. I felt sluggish, self-conscious, and had no confidence. After working hard to get ""in shape"", I lost the weight and have ""kept it off"" for lack of a better term ever since. I run daily (3-5 miles; longer on the weekends) and have previously done consistent weight lifting routines. Life has caught up with me and I've fallen off the weight lifting train, but still keep up a regular cardio routine (runs in the morning, lots of walking with my 2 year old border collie!). I tend to eat healthy...by ""tend to"", I mean that I track my calories and my weight (and have for at least 8 years, consistently). I have a pretty good idea of what my maintenance calories.

That said...I feel that I have developed an eating disorder over the last two years or so. Food is never just ""food"" to me anymore. I see everything on my plate as calories. I think, ""oh if I want to eat that cookie, I am going to need to go on a run to offset those calories"". I find myself pre-planning meals, especially if I am going to go out with friends, or get reservations at a restaurant I've been dying to try. That way, I can plan the calories I'll be intaking and make sure I stay at or under my maintenance. I've also started to skip meals...mainly lunch, when I can. I'll have a Quest protein bar, or some carrots, or some other ""lower calories"" snacks to tide me over...drink lots and lots of water and sparkling water to keep me ""full"". And then I'll eat a normal dinner...of course, more often than not, this has resulted in me having an awful binge night. The worst of which was, about a week ago, I ate close to a day’s worth of calories in one sitting and just felt terrible the next day - my mind telling me I had to ""further restrict"" to avoid eating too many calories after the binge. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to view food as ""food"", how to not feel guilty for eating when I'm hungry, or for enjoying a cookie or some ice cream or a beer/cocktail with friends. I don't know how to retain confidence, because so much of my ""confidence"" is tied up in me feeling good about my weight and how my body looks. If I wear a shirt that clings too tightly to my sides, I am extremely conscious of my love handles. I feel awful when I eat ""too much"", or when I allow myself to have a treat. On days when I am unable to exercise, I feel terrible if I eat ""too much"". When I see the estimate in MyFitnessPal of ""if every day were like today, you'd weight XXX..."", I feel devastated if the estimate is higher than my current weight. 

All this being said, I also struggle because I feel like, objectively, I am healthy, lean, and in good shape. I do not have anorexia or bulimia. I know that countless people would love to have ""my body""...but I still cannot help but feel like I am going to ""get fat"" again and gain all the weight back that I lost over a decade ago.

,EatingDisorders,"Hey guys! I’m in recovery-ish from anorexia and it’s been a bumpy road so far. I’ve kind of been relapsing lately and since trying to recover a lot of conflicting voices are more present now, more than ever. Firstly, there’s the Ana-voice telling me to restrict. Secondly, there’s the recovery-voice telling me I deserve food and should eat more despite being terrified of weight gain. Third, there’s now this feeling of unstoppable desire to eat anything and everything- and a lot of it. I’ve read about others who’ve experienced the same; extreme hunger.

I feel like there hasn’t been a lot of official research on extreme hunger so I have conflicting thoughts on what the right thing to do is.

[Tabitha Farrar wrote a blog post](https://tabithafarrar.com/2017/02/anorexia-recovery-eating/) on the topic, encouraging recovering anorexics to let go of ALL forms of restricting, to let your body have as much food as you want in recovery. She writes about honoring you body and mind when it tells you to eat entire cakes or jars of peanut butter, for as long as your body wants it. She explains that, at least for her, the extreme desire for food settles after a while.

I’m curious if any of you guys have any experience with this? What I’m terrified of, besides weight gain🙃, is it turning into BED or bulimia (the latter is kind of the case for me now, after I’ve gained some weight in my semi-recovery).

,EatingDisorders,"Hey all, 

I'm concerned that I'm developing an eating disorder -- mainly due to the way I learned to survive food insecurity and general poverty. For years, I've been unable to eat a full meal most days. I got so used to this that even when I do have food, I stretch it for as long as possible. I feel intense guilt if I feel I've eaten too much in a day. Lately, I've begun to develop a paranoia about gaining weight. I'm terrified of it.

,EatingDisorders,"   (New to the sub, sorry if I break any rules unknowingly)

I (20 m) have been struggling with eating for most of my life. I'll try to keep this as short as possible so I'm really sorry if it seems like too much to read! I am currently underweight. Although it can be alot worse, my body is in bad shape.

   The Reasoning for this is because I have struggled eating ""normal"" food. I used to be a very chubby healthy kid, but once I became 11 years old, it all suddenly went downhill. I would instantly throw up anything I was fed. I mostly grew up surviving on junk food and if I were to try and eat ""normal"" food, my body would reject it. My family (which was obviously concerned) tried to get me a food therapist. I had one session with her and then she disappeared. I don't know the reason why but I'm guessing it's because my mom didn't have enough money to continue the therapy sessions.

   Fast forward and I'm slowly learning to eat more and more kinds of foods but it's still not enough. My body starts to get thinner and thinner. And now in present day, I mostly eat fast food, junk food, and easy-to-eat foods (yogurts, cereal, etc) If I'm lucky I would eat 1 meal a day. Whenever I try to expand my horizon and attempt to eat something fancy, I instantly gag, get nauseous, and just refuse to eat it. Heck I can't even eat pizza!! PIZZA OF ALL THINGS!

,EatingDisorders,"My dad is always forcing my siblings and I to eat. Ever since I could remember, my dad always gives us WAAAY too much food during meal times and then gets mad when we're ""wasteful"". We aren't always hungry and my dad says it's because we ""eat too much snacks"", but on the other hand, my dad allows us to have small snacks throughout the day and he even tells us to have snacks.

We don't have snacks as often anymore because we don't buy as many snacks, after all, my dad doesn't want to get yelled at by my mom, and we currently live in an apartment and our pantry isn't as big as it was in our old house.

I've had problems in the past with trying to &gt;!starve!&lt; myself, but I don't think that really has anything to do this with, because my siblings don't try to &gt;!starve!&lt; themselves but they still complain about my dad trying to make us eat a lot. And recently, IDK if it's bc I'm on my monthly, but I can't eat normal-sized meals without &gt;!gagging!&lt; and feeling the need to &gt;!throw up!&lt;.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I'm asking for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled with disordered eating on and off since my teens. I'm now almost 30. I've been starving myself an awful lot, especially the last 3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

In January this year I decided to start treating my body right and focusing on getting strong and healthy looking instead of small, weak and sick looking. I've been lifting weights and working out several times a week since, and I've pushed myself to eat accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm finding is that it's hard for me to eat ""normal"". I can starve myself like I've done in the past, or I can over eat to ""make up for"" how restrictive and mean I've been to myself. I can't seem to find a balance. I'm obsessive over food all the time and I'm so fucking tired of thinking so much about it. I don't want to, I'm so fucking done.

For example when I eat my healthy sized, varied and delicious breakfast every morning, I get so sad after my last bite because it was the last bite. My thoughts run crazy with things like ""it's so unfair other people can eat how much they want but I have to control my portions"", ""I'm not full enough, I want to eat more but I cant, and I feel so bad for myself for never being satisfied"". I also find it extremely hard to control myself with delicious food. I recently got a new boyfriend who is an amazing cook, and whenever he makes something amazing (basically every fucking day) I'm struggling so incredibly much with not over eating to the point of great physical discomfort.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like my body wants revenge for all the starvation in the past. I want to eat or chew something all the time, unrelated to being hungry or not - even when I'm already really full. Then comes the ""this is unfair""-thoughts and the shame and I'm just so exhausted by it all. I want to have a normal, calm and stress-less relationship to food. I want to not think about food and my body all the goddamn time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if anyone can relate, and if so, what are your ways of handling it? Have you found anything that has made it better and made your thoughts around food healthier?

,EatingDisorders,"Hi there. So I'm (28F) just looking for some advice I guess regarding my husband (30M) and his body image issues. He suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that I am sometimes concerned and honestly I'm reaching a point where I am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. I try to be understanding and reassuring to him. He has a very abusive father who he is permanently NC with now for over a year. His father spent basically his whole childhood berating DH for his weight. He was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. They filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. My heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight (just straight up bullying) and the things he would do to shame him for it.

When he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can't remember exactly what it was. His weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he's always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. When we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto.

He's gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. I'm a little chubby myself so I don't care at all. I'm bigger than him, I feel. He, however, is distraught about it all the time. He's tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it's honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together.

I've urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that's not diet-friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. He stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. It worries me a lot. If I wasn't with him almost all the time, I would really worry about him skipping meals.

My issue now is that I cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. It's starting to negatively affect my own self image and I'm starting to obsess too. I can't handle him saying ""I'm so fat"" and telling him ""You look fine, I like how you look"" twenty times a day. Sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so I don't know what to say. He sees a therapist for other things, and I have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won't do it. He thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won't care about how he looks and he'll get fat, and I don't know how to explain to him that that's not how that works.

I'm really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but I don't know how to say this to him. I'm so frustrated and sometimes I feel he can tell how tired I am of the conversation. I don't want to hurt him or make him feel like I'm not there for him, but there's nothing more I feel I can do and it's really starting to get into my head and I'm feeling bad about my own body.

,EatingDisorders,"I recently started gaining weight out of no where. For most of my life (I'm 22 now) I've been able to eat whatever I want without gaining any weight like the rest of my family. I'm constantly moving my body so I'm always burning calories. I haven't asked a doctor yet what's going on with my body, but I've been trying to cut back on junk food so I can lose at least 10 pounds. I'm buying and preparing more healthier dishes and watching YouTube videos of women suggesting the types of whole foods and meals I should eat. It's a huge struggle because my tongue is so used to eating sweets and junk that I'm not enjoying this new diet. Obviously I'm going to continue this diet so my body is healthy and I'm maintaing a normal body weight. But I really want to eat junk and sweets again as well.

I thought long and hard about this. At first I said, ""Okay, let's eat some junk and then work out extra harder."" But that sounds like a lot work. So then I asked myself, ""Why do you like junk so much?"" The flavor. The taste. Sometimes the texture and smell. So then I thought to myself, ""If the only reason you like eating junk is for the taste (duh), then why not just chew the food and spit it out? That way, all that bad processed food won't make your body unhealthy, fatigue, etc."". So I took a bite of fried chicken, chewed it, enjoyed the flavor and spit it out. Then I took a sip of water to get the aftertaste out of my mouth. I stood there and questioned whether this means I have an eating disorder. A big part of me feels there is nothing wrong with spitting out bad food. (I mean, IT'S BAD. We're technically not to supposed to consume processed food like KFC). A small part of me worries that this method will be a waste of money. But maybe it won't be. If I really think about it, it's no different than if the food came out while going no. 2. Instead it's coming out by my mouth (*not '*throwing up' cause stomach acid will mess up the throat and cause an alser. No thank you). The only difference between the food I will swallow and the food I won't swallow is, one is healthy enough for my body to absorb while the other isn't. 

So my question is, is this method harmful? Is it fine but weird? Would it be considered an eating disorder?

For most of my life (I&amp;#39;m 22 now) I&amp;#39;ve been able to eat whatever I want without gaining any weight like the rest of my family. I&amp;#39;m constantly moving my body so I&amp;#39;m always burning calories. I haven&amp;#39;t asked a doctor yet what&amp;#39;s going on with my body, but I&amp;#39;ve been trying to cut back on junk food so I can lose at least 10 pounds. I&amp;#39;m buying and preparing more healthier dishes and watching YouTube videos of women suggesting the types of whole foods and meals I should eat. It&amp;#39;s a huge struggle because my tongue is so used to eating sweets and junk that I&amp;#39;m not enjoying this new diet. Obviously I&amp;#39;m going to continue this diet so my body is healthy and I&amp;#39;m maintaing a normal body weight. But I really want to eat junk and sweets again as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought long and hard about this. At first I said, &amp;quot;Okay, let&amp;#39;s eat some junk and then work out extra harder.&amp;quot; But that sounds like a lot work. So then I asked myself, &amp;quot;Why do you like junk so much?&amp;quot; The flavor. The taste. Sometimes the texture and smell. So then I thought to myself, &amp;quot;If the only reason you like eating junk is for the taste (duh), then why not just chew the food and spit it out? That way, all that bad processed food won&amp;#39;t make your body unhealthy, fatigue, etc.&amp;quot;. So I took a bite of fried chicken, chewed it, enjoyed the flavor and spit it out.

A few years ago, when I was in high school, I was inpatient at a mental health facility, and one of my diagnoses was EDNOS. Over the years, my ED hasn’t really gotten better — it’s just gone through phases where I restrict and phases where I still dislike my body but don’t restrict.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi! Just found this sub and figured I’d post once a day to share my experiences going from orthorexia to anorexia to bulimia to anorexia to BED, i still struggle daily with the little things but I’d like to say my mindset is almost fully recovered. (Despite intrusive thoughts and a disordered environment) 

I’ll start today off with an experience of mine that is shared by many, how I began recovering from it, and how I continue to recover from it. Eating disorders are processes that take time, there is no quick fix, and that’s the reality.

One thing a lot of us with eating disorders seem to relate to is our relationship with food as children. Whether our parents were super health obsessed or the complete opposite, most times that ends up with children with complications relationships with food. In my case, my mother was a huge advocate for weight watchers and, growing up, most of my childhood snacks were weight watchers brand. (Despite being a very athletic and healthy kid). This, of course, took a toll on me when I discovered that other kids my age were not being fed these things, so any time I came across normal food, I would destroy that shit. It still affects me today, since I am a minor living with this same parent who STILL obsesses over her food intake and how much sugar or fat we are all eating as a family, despite pretty much all of her kids developing extreme forms of disordered eating. One of my many extremes was when I went keto at the ripe age of ELEVEN. I am seventeen now, and though I am a huge advocate for weightlifting, I no longer obsess over my food intake in any form. After going through the many eating disorders for roughly six years, someone asked me why I was weighing my food at a family reunion, and I told them why. That is when it clicked how ridiculous my eating habits were. That was my first step to recovery, discussing my disordered habits *out loud.*

I find that discussing your traumas with professionals helps you to understand that, though these tendencies are pretty insane, it’s not your fault and you are very much not alone. That is why I am posting on this sub today, because I know a lot of us on here don’t have access to professionals like others. So please, use the comments of this post to talk about your habits, if you may find that to be, in any way, of comfort or help. I encourage you all to reach out to professionals, if possible.

,EatingDisorders,"DISCLAIMER: I think healthy eating has more to do with the way you view food than what's actually in it, and you shouldn't define food by calories and whatnot. This post is not about that. I am also not asking for advice on how to get proper nutrition, this is simply about a mental block I have.



A big part of recovering from my restrictive ED was baking and  tasting the food I was making. From there on, I started practicing intuitive eating and letting myself grab a snack whenever I felt like it. When I choose what to have for dinner now, I think about what I feel like eating instead of limiting myself to certain foods or smaller sized portions. 

I mentally have no problem with this, but I've noticed that the lack of proper nutrition is affecting my body. I'm already a vegetarian, which also plays into this (I take vitamins for that, though). I feel weaker than before even though I eat as much as I want to, which is a big bother when I engage in one of my passions (dancing). I won't go into what my diet contains since it may be triggering to some people. 

I've been trying to change my diet in small ways in order to feel better physically but everytime I start thinking about what I eat, I end up falling back into my restrictive habits after a week or so. This is pretty distressing for me, and family etc have started pointing out that I'm ""eating unhealthy"", which makes the whole situation worse. It prevents me from being physically healthy because it makes it so much easier for me to relapse whenever I try to look over my diet.

This post is not about that. I am also not asking for advice on how to get proper nutrition, this is simply about a mental block I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of recovering from my restrictive ED was baking and  tasting the food I was making. From there on, I started practicing intuitive eating and letting myself grab a snack whenever I felt like it. When I choose what to have for dinner now, I think about what I feel like eating instead of limiting myself to certain foods or smaller sized portions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentally have no problem with this, but I&amp;#39;ve noticed that the lack of proper nutrition is affecting my body. I&amp;#39;m already a vegetarian, which also plays into this (I take vitamins for that, though). I feel weaker than before even though I eat as much as I want to, which is a big bother when I engage in one of my passions (dancing). I won&amp;#39;t go into what my diet contains since it may be triggering to some people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to change my diet in small ways in order to feel better physically but everytime I start thinking about what I eat, I end up falling back into my restrictive habits after a week or so. This is pretty distressing for me, and family etc have started pointing out that I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;eating unhealthy&amp;quot;, which makes the whole situation worse. It prevents me from being physically healthy because it makes it so much easier for me to relapse whenever I try to look over my diet.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"So I have a friend that has an eating disorder and I want to help but I don't know if I'm going about it the right way. 

She (22) has a terrible relationship with food; she doesn't really cook for herself nor will she make anything for herself that involves a stove. Also, she thinks she needs to lose weight and is in her process of doing so, which is basically not eating anything nutritious for her body and very small meals. For example, her entire food intake in one day will usually be a protein bar and some yogurt. Whenever what she ate for the day comes up in conversation, I don't know what to say and try not to say something like ""that's not enough"". But obviously, that's not the right response. I just don't know how to respond or handle it the situation.

 I get so frustrated because what she isn't doing is not good for her and I hate seeing her do this. Except I know me being frustrated with her will not help. I know I can't tell her ""you need to eat more"" because that doesn't do anything. I don't know how to talk to her about this, I really think she needs to see a professional. What is the right way to handle this situation? We have known each other for about a year, she's younger than me and I'd say we have a relatively close relationship. I love cooking and I would love to help but is it better just to stay out of it? I have never met any of her other friends, we live in about an hour from each other so we don't see each other all the time; so I'm sure her other friends must know what's going on. I would hope at least...

In the end, I guess my questions are: what is the best way to handle this situation? Is it ok for me to tell her that she needs to see a therapist? Whenever she brings up what she has eaten for the day, do I just move along with the conversation? When we hang out in person, is it better to bring it up then? I really want to help and and move her in the right direction, but I don't want to say something that will make the situation worse.

I’ll start by saying my relationship with food is complicated and maybe always has been. Recently, I’ve been trying to eat more and think of food as fuel, eating more intuitively and really trying to notice when I feel hunger. My partner has been very helpful to me in that way by checking in and asking me if I’ve eaten today, what did I eat, am I hungry, etc.

I’ve realized though that it’s not that I’m intentionally not eating, it’s that I’ll want to eat but everything sounds bad. It’s like nothing sounds *good enough* to eat, which makes me think I’m not really hungry which then leads me to not eating as much as I should. I definitely feel times where I’m like “yes I definitely want to eat this” for example today I had a veggie dog, and yesterday I had some bangin avocado toast, a pear, some tofu, all of which I really wanted to eat. But I don’t feel this way often, so I’m wondering if anyone has advice or any suggestions as to things I could read/listen to to work through this?

I’m on the road to recovery from years of disordered eating. 

I’m finding that I’m constantly hungry which is now leading me to snack (not good!) 

I’m conscious therefore that I need to eat more, but don’t want to do so unhealthily. 

Any advice as to how I can get more nutritious and filling food into my diet?

My typical meal plan:

Breakfast: porridge (oatmeal) with raspberries and blueberries 

Lunch: turkey or chicken salad with some Stilton and an apple or yoghurt. 

Snack: often a packet of pop chips. 

Dinner: grilled chicken with seasoning, veg and baked potatoes or scrambled eggs and veg on toast. 

As I said, the problem is I’m constantly hungry (and tired!) so I need to eat more more want to do so healthily and sustainably.

&lt;p&gt;Any advice as to how I can get more nutritious and filling food into my diet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My typical meal plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast: porridge (oatmeal) with raspberries and blueberries &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch: turkey or chicken salad with some Stilton and an apple or yoghurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snack: often a packet of pop chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner: grilled chicken with seasoning, veg and baked potatoes or scrambled eggs and veg on toast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, the problem is I’m constantly hungry (and tired!) so I need to eat more more want to do so healthily and sustainably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hello everyone,

Over the past year, my fiance's family and I have slowly accepted the reality that her baby sister (17f) has an eating disorder. It started with what we originally thought was gastritis and her complaining of stomach pains. As clues started coming together, her doctors began to realize that she was intentionally starving herself. As of now she is severely underweight and her doctors have said that she has little to no visceral fat surrounding her organs and her intestines are becoming necrotic. Her parents feel absolute shame for letting her get this far in the disease and are desperate for help.

My fiance's family lives in western Europe while we are in the US, adding to our own sense of helplessness. Their country is known for very blunt medical care, so after the doctors developed suspicion, they and the hospital staff immediately began accusing my sister-in-law of the disorder and treating her like a criminal/selfish for having one while admitting her, which I believe pushed her deeper into the pro-ana community. She's since deleted any of her whole-body instagram pictures, body-checks herself in the mirror constantly, purposely got a job at a brewery where she works 14 hour shifts at a time to have an excuse not to eat, always saying she's tired and going to her room without dinner, etc.

We honestly don't know what to do as we have been getting conflicting advice, and we are desperate for answers. One of her primary doctors told her father that he's afraid to admit her to an ED rehab center as she'll be with many girls in the pro-ana community that could potentially positively feedback on her ED. However, she's also going to turn 18 in a year and have complete medical autonomy, so they are running out of time to admit her to anything involuntarily.

Please tell me any stories, anecdotes, or advice on what to do next. Her family asks me for help because I'm a doctor, but I've come to realize how poorly my medical education has prepped me on this subject. I am leaning towards telling them to admit her involuntarily to the ED rehab center as a last ditch effort, but I know this is an addiction and there are no fast or easy solutions.

,EatingDisorders,"Hey guys. I'm looking for some help. Last October, after becoming overweight over lockdown due to mental health issues, I began trying to lose some weight. Most of my motivation to lose the weight came from persistent comments from my family and such; I was happy with my body. It wasn't really something I thought about. I don't know thought. One day I just snapped. I ended up losing a good amount, and once I hit my goal weight (pre-lockdown weight), I wasn't happy; I had to keep going. I've stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven't really gone past a safe deficit. However, I know my mindset isn't a healthy one. I'm obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. My weight-loss hasn't been drastic, and im still in a 'healthy' BMI now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. 

However in the past few months, I've started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. Today was my second visit, and my doctor expressed concern with it, saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she'll consider referring me to a nutritionist. This means that my weight loss is no longer something I can hide behind, which terrifies me. I'm not happy with my body yet, but I have no other choice but to try and recover. I don't want to but there's not really another choice. I'm worried if I'm referred to a nutritionist I'll be forced to stop being vegan (my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons), or something so I would really love to avoid having to go to one. I'm so worried and I don't want to stop losing but I need to recover.

I don&amp;#39;t know thought. One day I just snapped. I ended up losing a good amount, and once I hit my goal weight (pre-lockdown weight), I wasn&amp;#39;t happy; I had to keep going. I&amp;#39;ve stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven&amp;#39;t really gone past a safe deficit. However, I know my mindset isn&amp;#39;t a healthy one. I&amp;#39;m obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. My weight-loss hasn&amp;#39;t been drastic, and im still in a &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; BMI now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in the past few months, I&amp;#39;ve started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. Today was my second visit, and my doctor expressed concern with it, saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she&amp;#39;ll consider referring me to a nutritionist. This means that my weight loss is no longer something I can hide behind, which terrifies me. I&amp;#39;m not happy with my body yet, but I have no other choice but to try and recover. I don&amp;#39;t want to but there&amp;#39;s not really another choice. I&amp;#39;m worried if I&amp;#39;m referred to a nutritionist I&amp;#39;ll be forced to stop being vegan (my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons), or something so I would really love to avoid having to go to one. I&amp;#39;m so worried and I don&amp;#39;t want to stop losing but I need to recover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of you guys have advice for self recovery and getting out of the &amp;quot;not sick enough&amp;quot; mindset and pursuing recovery? How do I get my &amp;quot;goal weight&amp;quot; out of my mind and try to get over this&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Just looking for some advice as I don’t have much experience with this.

My best friend has struggled with anorexia in the past (before I knew her) but has been ok until recently.

I recently expressed that I wanted to go on a night out with her but she replied that she wouldn’t have anything to wear because she doesn’t fit into most of her clothes anymore.

I said she could just borrow some of mine which she replied:
“i don’t think i’d fit into your clothes anymore because I’m now a size ‘*’. ”

Which is ridiculous because I have been between that size and the size above for most my adult life.

We’ve also always shared clothes even though a lot of her clothes are tiny on me (i went out in her skirt once with the zip half undone).

I ended up calling her dramatic which looking back was probably not the best response but I just really don’t understand her mindset with this. Especially as she’s so logical about literally anything else.

Anyway despite what she’s said i’m going to bring over some of my clothes because they are generally bigger.

But now because she’s so hyper focused on size i’m thinking to cut out the labels?
But then she’s also so delusional about my size that maybe I should leave them in?  

Like i think she has it in her head that i’m really skinny because i’m a good few inches taller and pretty sporty.
But a majority of the time i wear clothes that are a way bigger size than she does.

So maybe if I keep them in, she knows it’s ok to be that size?

,EatingDisorders,"I think my boyfriend is struggling with food. I myself am recovering from an ED that I struggled with for almost a decade. I feel I have gotten very far in my recovery. 

A couple years ago, I started a relationship with my current boyfriend. He was skinny. He did eat a lot (and mostly fast food), but because of financial reasons, food was not always available. I think he managed to eat a lot at times and not gain weight, simply because he sometimes had to skip meals because he had no money for food. Since we have been living together, there is always food available, because my financial situation is quite good. He now has access to a filled pantry, fridge, freezer, snacks and regular meals. He also works from home now, instead of cycling to different locations each day. Over the last years, he has gained weight (he still has a healthy weight) that he now wants to lose. I don't object to this. 

However, he really hates his body now. He doesn't even want to be intimate any more because of his looks. He tells me he considers taking medication for adhd because it makes him lose his appetite. He doesn't have adhd though. He says things like only drinkint vinegar for a day, or vomiting after every meal, or eating rotten food or throwing out perfectly fine food. I recognise all of this. When I was deep in my ED, I had all these thoughts over and over again. I took pills, threw away food.... I understand him. The point is that he says I dont understand him and that nobody understands him. 

Recently, he became more hostile to me. Suddenly I and my family are the reason that he is gaining weight and we are his enemy. I cook him food, because that's how we decided to divide chores between us. During the years that we are together, I have been able to maintain the same weight. 

Last week we went to a family get together. There were fries, but it was a buffet style meal so no one was forced to eat something they didn't like. He ate fries, a lot of fries. When we got home, he suddenly started blaming my family and I that he ate fries. He said that I didn't support him, that I let him eat fries even when I knew he didn't want to. Personally, that fact that he ate fries wasnt even on my mind. And I definitely wasnt going to tell him what he could and could not eat in public, in front of my family. I think that is humiliating, and I wouldnt want to humiliate him in front of my family. 

He now says that's just an excuse I made up. He says that I should police his food if I care about him and our relationship. While I feel that a middle age can assemble a meal from a buffet and make the decisions he wants to make. 

I dont want to be the food police, because I know how much that hurt me in the past. I dont want to push an extreme diet on him, because I know it does not work in the long term. I dont want to support his disorder behaviour because I know how damaging it is and how hard it is to recover. I understands he doesn't like the weight gain, but I want to help him in a healty way. 

Whereas he thinks I dont support him, if I dont hate his body as much as he does or if I dont force a restrictive food intake upon him. Thruth is, I love his body! He even threatened to leave me for this. Which seems so silly to me, because we worked out way bigger issues in the past (money, kids, family, religious and cultural differences). I love him so so much and I dont want this to break us up, but I am desperate because I am getting a lot of hate from him now too.

Does anybody know what I can do to help him?

I myself am recovering from an ED that I struggled with for almost a decade. I feel I have gotten very far in my recovery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I started a relationship with my current boyfriend. He was skinny. He did eat a lot (and mostly fast food), but because of financial reasons, food was not always available. I think he managed to eat a lot at times and not gain weight, simply because he sometimes had to skip meals because he had no money for food. Since we have been living together, there is always food available, because my financial situation is quite good. He now has access to a filled pantry, fridge, freezer, snacks and regular meals. He also works from home now, instead of cycling to different locations each day. Over the last years, he has gained weight (he still has a healthy weight) that he now wants to lose. I don&amp;#39;t object to this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he really hates his body now. He doesn&amp;#39;t even want to be intimate any more because of his looks. He tells me he considers taking medication for adhd because it makes him lose his appetite. He doesn&amp;#39;t have adhd though. He says things like only drinkint vinegar for a day, or vomiting after every meal, or eating rotten food or throwing out perfectly fine food. I recognise all of this. When I was deep in my ED, I had all these thoughts over and over again. I took pills, threw away food.... I understand him. The point is that he says I dont understand him and that nobody understands him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, he became more hostile to me. Suddenly I and my family are the reason that he is gaining weight and we are his enemy. I cook him food, because that&amp;#39;s how we decided to divide chores between us. During the years that we are together, I have been able to maintain the same weight. &lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Hi there! I’m seeking for help and advice on Reddit as a very close friend of mine seems to be suffering from an eating disorder and it worries me a lot.
So I’ve known her since she was 11 yo and back then she had a super healthy relationship with food and a healthy weight. Fast forward to when she turned 16 - she started having digestive complications and extremely painful cramps when she ate fibrous foods. She went to the ER and she did many tests (IBS, Crohn, etc but they were all negative). So she reduced her intake of fibrous foods but still ate a little bit of everything, she didn’t lose weight. However, 6 years ago she met this gym addict guy and started going to the gym regularly. I didn’t see her much at that time because we studied in different countries and when I saw her a year later I was stoked - she lost so much weight I almost didn’t recognise her. 
We were going out for dinner but she didn’t drink anything, and ate barely nothing because all the foods offered ‘were too painful to digest’. Apparently she had extremely painful cramps every time she ate something she couldn’t digest, and this involves what seems to be 99% of the food: pretty much every fruit, veggies, cereals, meat, fish, dairies, etc. But she still didn’t get diagnosed a digestive disorder.
Now since that time we met I’ve seen her every 3 months: the strain she puts on her body is insane. I told me she last had her period 3 years ago - she’s obviously really underweight, but she goes to the gym every day for 2 to 4 hours despite her body being so fragile. I really thought she was genuine about the intestinal cramps so I started helping her map the foods she could actually eat and she saw a dietician which was not helpful at all - they weighed her and said she was on the ‘upper limit of healthy fat percentage for women’. Like wtf she’s only bones and muscles, but she now told me for the first time that ‘she didn’t see herself weighing more, where would more weight go she would look so bloated’. She let a few sentences like this slip by accident in our conversations when we traveled - ‘I really enjoy wearing XXXS clothing’ - ‘yoghurt doesn’t hurt my stomach but it makes me gain weight like crazy I can’t have too much of it’ or ‘we didn’t walk much this weekend i’ll have to workout to make up for it when I get back home. 
Now i’m pretty sure she has an Ed - but which one? And also how could I help her? I’m the only one she talks to about her eating issues because she says i’m the only one who understands. I don’t think she realises she’s suffering from something more than a purely digestive issue. She also would never go to see a psychiatrist - we come from village where people still believe only crazy persons consult them. She lives with her mom which is extremely toxic and controlling and just bullies her into eating more saying things like ‘you’re so skinny you’re gonna break’ ‘just stop complaining and eat already’ etc

,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I am currently trying to recover from a food obsession/restrictive diet. Advice I see a lot is having no ""off-limits"" food, and allowing your hunger cues and cravings to determine what you eat. And this is helping a lot! Allowing myself to eat ""what I want"" helps to stop overeating from a lack of food satisfaction.

However, I have a very, *very* long list of food intolerances, and because of this, sometimes what I truly want is, by necessity, off limits. This then triggers that restrictive mindset as I'm not allowing myself to eat something, even if it isn't by choice. Just a few things I'm intolerant too are wheat, yeast, dairy, cocoa, sesame, hazelnuts, cashews, coffee/caffeine, and many more common foods. Eating out is really difficult as I can usually only have a salad or steak and chips. I.e. a common restriction food vs a common guilt food.

She used to force herself to puke after eating so she wouldn't gain any calories, she used to not eat anything even if she is starved, and more things like that. And yesterday she asked me if she gained weight. I said ""no"" but she said she doesn't see herself beautiful.

I know she may want to lose weight but I am afraid of the possibility that trying to lose weight would lead to ED. Because I can't stand seeing her like that.

Today she said that she was going to text me whenever she eats something, and she asked me to say stop to her if she was eating desserts or any kind of fast food. She said she just wants to lose some kg. But after losing some kg, she may not be happy with that too so she would want to lose more. She thinks that losing some kg would make her more confident and love her body more. I said her that she doesn't have to lose some kg to love her body and feel confident, she just needs to love herself in any condition. And she shouldn't change her body to feel good, she just needs to change her mind.

I just want her to be happy but since I don't know what should I do, I am asking you guys. Bc this girl is my everything and I want to be as helpful as possible.

He angrily said something that is still really upsetting me, “you need to stop throwing up, ordering ice cream, and get to the gym”. This really upset me because I rarely order ice cream anymore and was working on being healthier by going on walks daily ( I had gotten ice cream one within the past 2 weeks). I am now going to the gym but cannot stop thinking about what he said, and definitely have started my ED again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I being overly sensitive? I’m not sure what to do, I just know I feel really badly. I want to get back on track, but I can’t stop focusing on the possibility that he really wants me to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"“Ensuring coproduction for the RecoverRiver app: A mixed-methods exploration of the needs and opinions of people recovering from eating disorders”

Hi all, my name is Lucy and I am part of a group of researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University who are working on a mobile app to support long-term recovery from eating disorders.

We would like to hear from people who experienced eating disorders and are now in recovery, to make sure we develop app contents that reflect their needs, preferences and opinions.

You can take part if you are:
- Over 18
- Any gender
- From anywhere in the world internationally
- Fluent in English 
- Have received a diagnosis of ED(s) from a certified medical/clinical professional 
- In recovery for at least three months (self-report) 

You’ll be asked to complete an online survey (you can complete it from your phone or any other device). It’ll take about 15 minutes of your time. You will remain anonymous at all times. 

Have questions? Contact the PI: lucy.Baumhauer@stu.mmu.ac.uk
Or her supervisor, Dr Daniela Di Basilio: d.di-basilio@mmu.ac.uk

,EatingDisorders,"Hi beautiful people!

I’m a recovering bulimic and anorexic who has been suffering from a whole new strange syndrome for the past six months. I’m writing this post not for professional medical advice but to see if anyone else has experienced this and can help me find some hope because I am feeling rather hopeless.

What I have is called Night Eating Syndrome. Every night, I wake up every two or three hours ravenously hungry. It doesn’t matter what I eat during the day or at night, how much exercise I get, whether or not I take a sleep med. Every night I wake up at least three times and have to binge on food to get back to sleep. If I eat and wake up two hours later, I am hungry again.

I’m curious to know if anyone else has experienced this because I’m starting to think this was caused by my eating disorder. It’s unraveling my life I’m so many ways. I’m tired every day, and even though I’m working on body positivity, I am gaining massive amounts of weight from this even when I eat healthy during the day.

I feel like I conquered my eating disorder and now am cursed with this whole new subconscious thing. I don’t know what to do.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone :)

I've been a silent reader who has browsed reddit, specifically ED forums for years, but have never posted. Today I woke up feeling absolutely gutted, so I decided to make an account and write this post in hopes of getting some kind of help and guidance. I don't have anyone in my life to talk to that understands what I'm going through.

For some background, I'm a 23 year old female. Growing up, I never thought about weight. While in high school, I was naturally on the thinner side. I didn't have any eating struggles, I was just a taller kid with a quick metabolism and my parents always fed me healthy and nutritious home cooked meals. I didn't eat much at a time, but I ate super often. My parents would get mad at me when we went out because I would never finish my food.

I think it was after I graduated from high school that I became a full on foodie. I started really loving and appreciating food, would love to eat out with friends, try new places, etc. I started never leaving a plate empty.

I am still in my weight range, not over, and to most people look a perfectly normal weight. However, after a few years of really loving food (especially sweets and junk food), I dont know how, but one day it just hit me that I didnt look like I did before. Like when I was younger and could wear low waist jeans without even realizing that they were low waist. My stomach wasnt flat anymore. When I gain weight, it goes straight into a tummy pouch, and to my face (especially chin area).

I decided to make a change, and started making sure I never ate after 7 PM, because I used to be a night eater. I started losing weight pretty fast. I wasn't restricting; in fact, sometimes I would eat as much as possible at 6:50 just to ensure I wouldn't be hungry at night. I still lost weight. I was super happy with how I was looking.

But, after a certain point, the weight loss stopped. But something in me changed... and that wasn't good enough. I somehow became obsessed with losing weight. Thats when I started restricting myself. I would have a schedule. A Starbucks iced coffee at 2 PM, should hold me until 6 PM, when I would then have a really tiny meal (even using measuring tools to be able to count the calories in the olive oil used to grease the pan) to make sure my calorie intake for the day was extremely low. I was able to do this for a while, and I would lose weight every single day. I became the weight I wanted and I was somewhat happy with how I looked. But after I reached that weight, I was able to maintain the lifestyle for a while at first... but then it started getting really hard.

I ended up getting into a restrict/ binge cycle. I would have the extremely low number of calories for a few days, and then I would end up being so so hungry, that I would transition into a full blown binge. I couldn't take the hunger anymore and would eat everything in sight. Instead of just eating to a point where I got full, I would eat until I was super stuffed and felt sick. While I was restricting I would make lists while super hungry at night, to fantasize about what I could eat on a cheat day. During a binge I would want to give myself everything I ever wanted on that list, in hopes that I would get over the craving and do better tomorrow. My body was so hungry that I wanted everything, and I was in an all or nothing mindset; I already ruined everything so might as well get the most food out of it. The next day I would be so upset that I binged, that I would restrict to make up for it. Then I would get super hungry from restricting, and then binge again. The cycle never stopped.

I would be laying in bed in so much pain. I remember only having fruit one day and then waking up in the middle of the night sweating, crying, feeling extremely dizzy and faint, having intense stomach pain and feeling very nauseous. I was in so much pain that I didnt even feel hungry because too much was going on. I thought I could die. I got up and crawled to the kitchen and force fed myself a banana, struggling to swallow but trying so hard so that I wouldn't pass out. There were a lot of times like this. There was so much mental pain and physical suffering. No one really knew or could tell, because since I was in the binge cycle, my weight looked normal due to the ""balance.""

Time went on, and I ended up trying to continue what I had before, but I would keep failing at my restriction. I wouldn't eat the entire day, but then 10 PM would hit and I would fall into a binge. I would try to make up for it the next day, not eating throughout the day because I thought Id be able to make it, but then the same thing would happen. Restriction wasnt making it through the day anymore, just constant binging.

This has been going on for 3-4 years. I always had the dream of getting back to the same lower weight, and that once I would restrict enough to get there, I could focus on getting healthy and eating normally... but only once I got there. Well, I was never able to get there again. Fast forward to now, my eating is still not normal. Whether its a binge or a restrict, I've still not recovered. I started getting intense dizzy spells a few weeks ago. It was really scary.

I saw a doctor and we did a few tests and saw that my blood sugar was low. I did some research, and it seems like its something that can happen and be dangerous with eating disorders. I decided I wanted to make a change.

Instead of doing extremes, like binging or restricting, I decided to try and eat a normal amount. I will be honest with you guys, Im not doing complete miracle work; im still restricting a bit. However, not like before. The reason is because I am still wanting to lose weight. Nothing extreme, but I want to. Instead of the super restricted number of calories a day, Im having at least double of that. I will be honest; I still go to bed hungry a lot. But I tell myself Im healing and its a great start so I ignore that. I wasnt active during my issues in the past; I spent most days at home working on the computer. I started getting up every morning and going on 2-4 mile walks. I thought that this new lifestyle change would be amazing for me, and that I would instantly lose weight after stopping what became a 99% of the time binge.

The scale had showed a small amount of progress in the beginning, three weeks ago, pretty quickly. Then, it completely stopped. I have been stuck at the same weight ever since then. It is making me go insane. It is making me want to relapse. I keep telling myself just restrict, get your summer body fast, take all the pictures and wear all the outfits and do all of the things you want, and then start healing. I know mentally I shouldn't, but I am really really distraught. The weight Im at shouldn't be my bodies natural weight, because its still the weight that I would have while I was binging. I wake up every morning and check the scale and start crying. If a couple of pounds is the only difference, why not enjoy binges?

Why am I walking everyday, eating super clean and healthy, and working so hard for nothing? It feels useless. Im writing this post as a last resort because Im wondering if anyone knows why I am still going to bed hungry, but eating clean and a more normal amount, getting out there and exercising, but still not losing weight.

I appreciate any help, Im feeling really desperate right now.

\*side note; Is it normal that now during recovery, if I don't eat for three hours between meals my body starts getting light headed and feeling like its going to shut down? It really scares me and triggers anxiety attacks. I dont know why my body has such an intense reaction to going without food for what I would assume are normal periods of time, especially now that im (apparently) doing better.",t2_izhgiqzb,False,,0,False,My ED Story/ Wanting Recovery Advice,[],r/EatingDisorders,False,0.0,,0,,,False,t3_vnwdrd,False,dark,0.87,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,False,self,1656568060.0,,[],{},,,True,,1656553728.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.EatingDisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone :)&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"(Throwaway bc I dont want to my friend to find out about this post) I don't know how to write this down or how to put it into words, because I am just unsure on how I should be approaching the situation, or if it's even the right thing for me to be doing what I'm doing right now (I know that sounds weird, but I will explain it later)

So as the title says, one of my friends seems to be suffering from an eating disorder. To give some background, I've known this person since the beginning of our freshman year, and although we didn't talk that often, we still were able to get along pretty well. After freshman year, while we weren't able to hang out because of quarantine, we still kept in touch with each other and eventually managed to become closer friends with each other. As of now, we are both upcoming seniors who are about to enter our last year of high school, and honestly I am so glad to have met him as I really care about him a lot, which is why I am even making this post to begin with. While we aren't  hanging out that often during the summer, since even though we go to the same school, we mostly just text each other, we still keep in contact with each we (or atleast I) care for the both of us. 

Now onto the main issue. Let me state that I have only just started to learn about this in the clearest detail that I have been recenty given. While he has previously mentioned it as an offshoot comment that he has had a type of eating disorder, I assumed that he had gotten better, but it seems to me that it might not be the case. Lately, he's been showing off some worrying behavior (keep in mind this is happening online because we havent been hanging out lately) and I decided to reach out to him about it. And after he talked to me about, I tried to cheer him up about it, and even thought I tried to make things better by being positive, internally I felt like I was going to breakdown from how i was supposed to even take in the information. I can't really explain exactly what it is that he said to me because some of it is too personal, but eitherway, the best way for me to show what it is that he said, is for me to quote some of the things that he said to me: 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

""basically, my mom was telling me that i need to eat more. (which is already a huge nope).""

 ""....i had literally been looking up ""how to make yourself vomit"" less than 10 minutes before the conversation."" (conversation was with their parents about their anorexia)

""i hold myself to very strict rules and ive kind of relapsed into my ed but i really cant help it, its safe to me"" 

""im just being pushed over the edge and sounding dumb""

""...acknowledgement that my behavior is unhealthy but its normal and safe and its the only thing i can control and food is absolutely fucking terrifying"" 

'im okay with eating shit i find on the streets because theres a chance I'll get sick from it, but food made with love? all i can think about is calories for both cases, how much i'll have to exercise to work it off, if i can chew and spit it somewhere discreet... but thats control and its healthy only for me.""

The reason I said at the beginning of the post that I didn't know if I should even be reaching out was because I fear that he's going to get mad at me for trying to reach out to people for seeking out help that he could use.

,EatingDisorders,"i just picked my bf up from work (I'm with the same company) and while we were there, a coworker commented on my weight. he said I'd lost weight - and i make a point in not even owning a scale so numbers can't trigger me. he meant it in a positive way, but now I'm kinda stuck in the mentality of doing well by not eating.

i've been slacking with eating because I'm in the middle of pretty important exams and wanted to put all my energy into studying. so i guess that's why i lost some weight, but it can't be a lot.

so now my bf just asked me if i wanted to have dinner with him. i said yes as i haven't eaten all day. but then he said we'd have to go grocery shopping in order to have enough food for both of us. and i immediately panicked.

grocery stores are basically my nemesis. for one, there's all this triggering food everywhere, then there are people who move slow or block lanes which causes me panic attacks (mostly when I'm already stressed) AND then there's the issue of me constantly thinking everyone's judging me for buying food. I'm chubby after all and my head is still convinced that everyone thinks badly of fat people who buy or eat food in public.

you see, it's a fucking downward spiral.

today is a day I'm 100% sure will cause a panic attack if i go to the store. so now i told my bf i don't want to eat. he's currently in the kitchen cooking for himself and I'll just wait for lunch at school tomorrow i guess.

and i hate myself for being like this. i just wanna cry and yell and i don't even know. why do i have to be this fucked up. i was on such a good track, not counting calories anymore and eating intuitively and everything. but the second I'm stressed I'm going right fucking back...

,EatingDisorders,"I’m struggling a lot with my eating. I’ve always had a hard time eating a lot of calories in a day, and been very skinny my whole life as a result. In 2019-2021 i for whatever reason gained a bigger appetite. I was able to eat three meals and graze on snacks throughout the day, and got up to a more healthy weight! 

This year has been very stressful for me. Lot of life changed and stressful events in general. I’ve gone back to eating very little, and lost weight as a result. My friends and family are concerned about my weight loss. I’m a 21 y/o male if that’s relevant. I know what weight I need to be but it’s really hard to get there. 

I have some “safe foods” I can consistently eat but they aren’t always available. I think I need to just force myself to eat food that I have in the house even if it isn’t “safe” but it’s so hard for me. I eat a few bites and feel full and feel like if i eat anymore im gonna throw up. Sometimes I do actually throw up. 

Any tips on how to get past this? If I lose too much more weight I might need to check myself into ED rehab or something. Im really worried because I have a lot going on in July and august and having to go to rehab would be a huge stressed on top of everything else.

In order to try and improve treatment options for eating disorders, I'm trying to better understand the process of recovery and what motivates it by looking at the role online support groups (such as FB groups, discussion forums and subreddits) have in their members recovery.

Taking part involves completing an anonymous online survey consisting of 11 questions altogether. 3 are short demographic ones and 8 need a little more time and attention.

The link to the survey is posted below. In the very first question there is a link to the participant information sheet which has the full details of my institution and contact details for the departmental ethics committee. My ethics application has been approved and the ID is 1889.

For the past few years I've found I'm just not hungry anymore. As I kid I would eat anything and everything at any time but I barely remeber those days anymore. It didn't start off too bad at first but it's gotten worse and worse over the years. Then a couple months back there was a mager change in my home life and it got a whole lot worse. For weeks I could barely eat to the point even my family members noticed when they never have before. Its worth noting that I deal with a lot of anxiety and my home situation and also another situation (it was a good thing just different) were making me anxious. Things got slightly better after a couple months but still a lot worse then it was before. I can't go to my family about this because they will think I'm anorexic. But the thing is I am not. I know I'm not because I don't care that much about my weight and how I look. I have a therepist and I'm thinking of getting her input before I go to my family because I recognise I need help and they might understand better with a professional opinion.

*Triggers* Details on what it's like.
•Most of the time I'm genuinely not hungry and can't stand to even think of food. When I have to eat it it makes me feel so sick. 
•Sometimes I get really really hungry and there's literally no amount of food I can eat that will fill me up but eventually it will just fade and I'm not hungry again
•I find it easier to eat junk food then healthy food
•Foods have been kinda split into two groups in my mind. A select few comfort foods I can eat without too much bother. Foods that make me gag to even think about eating even when I'm starving. And the ones in between that depending on how bad it is I may or may not be able to eat
•I've picked up some bad habbits to avoid this getting discovered. Mainly dumping food when I'm able so I can eat semi-normally when people are watching.
•I try to avoid skipping meals and if I have to dump something will substitute it for something easier(Usually some kind of bar that's easy to grab and I am able to eat) but if I'm not hungry at all. Which is often. I end up having to skip the meal. 
•I also feel really sick if I eat a full meal that would be considered an appropriate amount for my age

,EatingDisorders,"Hi! I don't normally use reddit but I'm at a loss, so hopefully someone here will be able to offer some insight and help me.

My best friend in the entire world (let's call him Eric) is a gay male in his early twenties (the relevancy to sharing this will come up later). We've known each other for an incredibly long time and have been basically inseparable. He has suffered with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known him. As we've blossomed into adulthood, we of course have had less time to hang out but still see each other once a month if not more. I can confidently say that they are my best friend and always will be.

Eric is a work-a-holic. He is currently in medical school and works insane hours where eating is not a priority as he is caring for other people. He has also been single for a very long time.

We saw each other this weekend and I noticed that he wasn't himself when it came to eating, though, I chose not to bring it up as I figured he would bring this up to me if he felt it was necessary. I chalked it up as he was just not hungry. He has also lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. I was correct and he did in fact message me this morning and told me that he was suffering and needed to talk to someone about it but he didn't want me to respond with ""too much"" as he was working and didn't want to become overwhelmed. He told me that he knows he has developed a eating disorder. He expressed everything he was feeling and how if he missed a day at the gym he would start crying and if he started to count his calories for the day, it would make him throw up. He also mentioned that he feels like this is due to not having any male attention in his life. He has been single for probably 6 or 7 years. Lastly, he mentioned that he knows he needs to see a therapist because it is getting worse by the day but he refuses to go.

How do you not respond to that? My heart broke for him. I responded with a short, comforting message and explained that if he felt this way that we should get him help and that I'd be happy to look up therapists covered by his insurance. I also typed up a long message in my notes which I shared with him and told him not to look at it until after work.

He didn't look at it. When I asked him if he had, he said that he was fine and that he appreciated everything but he was just stressed and explained that he will be okay. I don't mind that I took the time to write this message up, I'm just scared for my friend and want to help him.

As someone who has helped this person through their depressive battles, has seen them at their worst and know how bad it can get, I really fear for his mental health. I want to respect his wishes not to talk about it anymore, but at the same time I feel like a terrible friend not doing anything... At the same time, what can I do?

I feel like him reaching out to me was a cry for help and I don't want to insist that we talk about what is happening and get him help as I fear that it will only overwhelm him and he wont come to me in the future if and when this issue grows more severe. I want him to feel comfortable coming to me as I know how scary this world can be when you don't have someone.

&lt;p&gt;Eric is a work-a-holic. He is currently in medical school and works insane hours where eating is not a priority as he is caring for other people. He has also been single for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw each other this weekend and I noticed that he wasn&amp;#39;t himself when it came to eating, though, I chose not to bring it up as I figured he would bring this up to me if he felt it was necessary. I chalked it up as he was just not hungry. He has also lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. I was correct and he did in fact message me this morning and told me that he was suffering and needed to talk to someone about it but he didn&amp;#39;t want me to respond with &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; as he was working and didn&amp;#39;t want to become overwhelmed. He told me that he knows he has developed a eating disorder. He expressed everything he was feeling and how if he missed a day at the gym he would start crying and if he started to count his calories for the day, it would make him throw up. He also mentioned that he feels like this is due to not having any male attention in his life. He has been single for probably 6 or 7 years. Lastly, he mentioned that he knows he needs to see a therapist because it is getting worse by the day but he refuses to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you not respond to that? My heart broke for him. I responded with a short, comforting message and explained that if he felt this way that we should get him help and that I&amp;#39;d be happy to look up therapists covered by his insurance. I also typed up a long message in my notes which I shared with him and told him not to look at it until after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t look at it. When I asked him if he had, he said that he was fine and that he appreciated everything but he was just stressed and explained that he will be okay. I don&amp;#39;t mind that I took the time to write this message up, I&amp;#39;m just scared for my friend and want to help him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who has helped this person through their depressive battles, has seen them at their worst and know how bad it can get, I really fear for his mental health. I want to respect his wishes not to talk about it anymore, but at the same time I feel like a terrible friend not doing anything... At the same time, what can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like him reaching out to me was a cry for help and I don&amp;#39;t want to insist that we talk about what is happening and get him help as I fear that it will only overwhelm him and he wont come to me in the future if and when this issue grows more severe. I want him to feel comfortable coming to me as I know how scary this world can be when you don&amp;#39;t have someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone here has gone through this and has some advice for what I can do for my friend, I would greatly appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

But here is the thing.. 

I already did a lot for her, we talked about it so many times and I managed to talk her into at least talking to a doctor about it. She got this medicine that raise her appetite and she was on a really good way, wanting to recover which made me extremely proud and happy.

,EatingDisorders,"Hi! I've been reading a memoir written by an ED sufferer -anorexia/bulimia- (""La dieta de la muerte"" by Denisse Fuentes). I'm looking for more information on this topic

She mentions something I had never heard of before. It's only available in Spanish so I will translate the quote: ""The new doctor ordered a bunch of exams and the results showed issues with my liver, pancreas and a severe insuline resistance -that according to her was the reason behind my sudden weight gain-. She precribed drugs to improve the functioning of the affected organs and to regulate the metabolism.""

In the book she explains that her body suddenly swelled dramatically in a matter of hours. I don't want to share exactly how much weight it was to avoid triggering anyone but it's a truly horrifying amount

So she goes to the ER, medical staff couldn't find the cause and after a couple of days she was discharged with the advice to just wait for her body to go back to normal on its own.

,EatingDisorders,"
I’ll give some context in the body here, but I want to preface with the fact that ED help where I live is basically nonexistent unless you are visibly very ill.

I’m 18, 5’3 and weigh a healthy weight. I’ve struggled with body image issues for a few years, and I’d say I spend upward of 2-3 hours per day staring at my body in mirrors, cameras and any other reflective surfaces. 

About 9 months ago I started checking calories on things and avoiding them if they’re not small numbers. I was slightly overweight at that point.

In January of 2022 I decided I wanted to be skinnier, that was my goal. I hated everything about my body. So I started going to the gym 5x a week consistently and basically dropped all “junk” food, dropping my calories to a number that is sustainable but far less than what I was eating prior.

Between then and now, I’ve tried on several occasions to purge but for some reason I cannot vomit, it just doesn’t work. My body won’t eject vomit. I just gag aggressively. I still try though.

Fast forward to today, I have dropped some weight and now am considered a healthy weight. I still think I look the same as I used to and I still am not happy with how I look. The time I spend looking at my appearance and judging each feature and how clothes look on me has increased over time.

Now food is where I get concerned. I still eat, but I feel guilty about it unless it’s something like raw fruit or veggies in small quantities. I don’t like family events because I’m expected to eat more than what I am comfortable eating in front of everyone. I am scared to eat up to my calorie expectation for the day, or go over, because I am absolutely terrified of gaining weight again. I genuinely think I’d do something bad if I gained again. 

If any individual food item is over a small number of calories I get very iffy about eating it, and my meals usually don’t exceed about a sixth of my daily intake. I still exercise 4-5 times per week as well.

I’m just so concerned bc this stuff takes up well over half of my waking thoughts. Family are concerned about me and think I look sick even though I don’t have any bones protruding (besides hips and collarbones).",t2_ehea35io,False,,0,False,Not sure if I have an ED,[],r/EatingDisorders,False,0.0,one,0,,,False,t3_vlw7p8,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,1,,False,False,self,1656338776.0,,[],{},,,True,,1656338505.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.EatingDisorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll give some context in the body here, but I want to preface with the fact that ED help where I live is basically nonexistent unless you are visibly very ill.&lt;/p&gt;

I (22F) haven’t been to a doctor to be seen for my ED. Note, I have been to some instacare clinics and told a doctor I had an ED while being checked for an injury but they didn’t pay much mind to it. But in junior high when I did Classical Ballet, I starved myself and limited myself to (at most) a couple progressive soup cans a day. I lost a significant about of weight in a month. This went on for about a year and a half. Since I quit ballet, my eating went back to normal but I did gain weight to the edge of being overweight according to BMI standards (BMI is not at all an accurate way to gauge health but I was chubby). 

Now I’ve been binging and purging, with use of laxatives as well, been doing so for about two years now. And I’ve also lost a significant amount of weight. My dentist knows I have an ED. She can tell by looking at my teeth. She’s offered me some resources but I can’t afford inpatient or therapy at the moment. It’s to the point where every time I do eat and I feel full, my body feels sick and I purge just to feel better. It now feels comforting to do so which I know is hurting my body and damaging my health. But I can’t help it. Or I eat until full, purge, and eat more, over and over until I get tired. 

I really don’t know what to do. I want to be better.

This is partly a reason why I keep doing it, is because to other people I look and seem fine. Also a year later after I told her about it, one meeting she said to me, “you look so skinny.

,EatingDisorders,"I can't stop switching between restricting, binge/purging, and binging. I first started having body image issues in elementary school, and became overweight during freshman year of college. I joined weight watchers and became underweight and loved my body. then I moved on to professional school where I have a lot more stress and much less time to exercise, and went through a really difficult relationship where the person I was dating started calling me fat after he found out I lost a lot of weight. this led me to start binge/purging or binging instead of restricting, and when we broke up about a year ago things got really out of control. I've gained about half the weight back and can't stop. I have weeks where I get better and think that it's all over for good, but then relapse entirely. I've tried to get mental health professionals but I can't get any Telehealth appointments and just hate myself so so much.

When I was a child, my family would give me tons of food just to look at me eating, because ""I was cute"". Years after, that feeding turned into complaining about me eating too much. 

Before, my mom would say: ""Eat a lot of bread, because it's cheap, and just a little bit of meat, because it's expensive.""
Almost over the night, she started to yell at me for eating too much bread. She thought I was fat and I should not eat it.
She always says: ""You are pretty, you have nice body shape, you don't want it to be covered in fat."" 
She is obsesed with everyone's weight, even her own. 

The other day I figured something out for the first time. She is the main reason for my possible ED. She has always been complaining about me being fat. She is very skinny, like underweight, she has heart problems and she is succsessfuly fighting cancer. But she litteraly crys for being ""fat"" and getting some fat on her stomach. I repeat, she is very very skinny and even her doctor told her that she has to gain some weight so the chemo doesn't kill her. If she is worried about her weight, what does she think about me? How does she see me?

My real struggle began in highschool, when I was seventeen. I decided to go on a diet with my friend. I lost a few pounds in a few months, but I never felt that bad in my life. I vommited if I ate ""too much"" anything, if I ate something that had many calories, but I didn't enjoy it. I hated myself for ""overeating"", even if I ate two apples, and I punished myself via puking. That horror never stopped, it just got smaller. 

Last year (I am 22yo) I was diagnosed with insulin resistance (prediabetes condition) and I had to stop eating any kind of sugar, bread, potatos, rice, pasta, some fruits. I was okay for a few months, but then I started to crash my diet and I hated myself even more, because it was not about weightloss anymore, it was about my health. I rarely ever puke, maybe once every two months. But I stop myself from doing it EVERY day, everytime I eat anything forbidden I want to throw it out of myself. I am aware that bulimia is bad, but it sometimes seems less dangerous than diabetes. When I'm hungry, and I have nothing ""sugarless"" to eat, I eat bread. Because I don't have time or energy or money to ALWAYS eat at the same time, healthy no sugar no oil food. I just can't eat salads anymore, they make me sick. Always the same, plain vegetables, tasteless meat. It is not hard to crash the diet. 

I am so f*cked up, I know I have to seek medical and psycological attention. But I just needed to vent somewhere, and I hope some of you can understand me. 

It is not just about my weight, it is about my mental and physical health. I want to be happy, I want to have kids, I want to live long.

I need some support.
After a bad relapse last year, being put into the hospital multiple times, &amp; going into residential treatment, I’ve found myself back to my anorexia again.
I’m at a higher weight so I feel like it’s fine &amp; it’s not a big deal or worrisome or anything like that.

How did you all cope with telling a new therapist about relapsing?
I’m afraid she’s gonna refuse to see me but she disclosed that she has another client with an ED.
So that also triggers my ED to be like “you can relapse because the other person gets to still be in their ED” which is a sad &amp; fucked up way of thinking, I know.
Anyways, sorry this is so long.
I just need support on how to mention relapsing incase she does say anything or mention anything in regards to it.

,EatingDisorders,"(I hope it's ok for me to post here)

So, I don't have an eating disorder myself. I should also preface that I'm not qualified to diagnose anything and stuff; that's why I'm here to ask for advice.

I suspect my that my friend may have an eating disorder. She's currently going through family troubles right now, and they're struggling financially. Because of that, she developed anxiety. She isn't formally diagnosed with depression (my country has so much issues when it comes to helping people with mental health problems, it deserves its own thread), but it is glaringly obvious that she is. But ok, like I've said I'm not qualified at all. So I may be very wrong.

Back to this, she just messaged me about issues she is going through. It fucking sucks because I can't help her directly and we can't meet in person for a myriad of reasons. I did tell her that she can just chat anytime and I would be there for support.

So she told me issues she was having, and another one I noticed but _she_ doesn't seem to think was a problem is that she hasn't eaten for days. This was before we ended the conversation, she had to stop and do something else.

This isn't the first time either, she's mentioned about her problems with eating in passing since the start of the pandemic (which I'm pretty is also when she started having aforementioned problematic relationship with food). I didn't think much of it back then but now, it's gotten dangerously concerning.

,EatingDisorders,"TLDR: I used to not eat. Now I eat. But I desire to stop eating again. Advice?

To start off, I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I wasn't sure where else to put this.

In high school and beginning of college, I did not eat very much. Maybe a peanut butter and jelly sandwich a day, some days nothing. Often when I would get hungry at night I would just go to sleep so I didn't have to feel it. On top of this I played sports, so the combination of not eating and exercise made me even skinnier.

I never had the desire to be skinny. I was just repelled by eating, for whatever reason. My weight was just a side effect. But I knew I needed to eat more. People would make comments about my weight, appearance, and how little I ate. I was embarrassed, and didn't like how I looked. I didn't feel attractive, I felt like a skeleton.

In college, I met someone who encouraged me to try new foods and eat more. I was mostly doing it to please  them, but I also knew it was good for me, and I did want to gain weight afterall. Since then, I have been eating a lot more, I eat more vegetables, and I started to gain weight!

However, once I began gaining, I didn't feel as happy as I thought I would. It almost felt like I was losing my identity... even though I didn't like that identity. I started feeling self conscious that I was gaining in the wrong places. Even though I still get told I am skinny, I feel like my stomach is big. I get embarrassed. I try working out but I either don't have time or I am too lazy. I know I need to eat healthier and work out, but sometimes I wish I could just go back to not eating... For some reason I want to feel that hunger again. To not have to worry about what food I am eating, because I can just not eat anything.

I know the answer but it is getting harder to resist the desire to not eat.

,EatingDisorders,"In March 2021, I was at my heaviest weight ever. I realized that I needed to start a weight loss journey, so I started eating healthier and exercising a little. After a while, though, I got obsessed with seeing progress on the scale and cared less about how easy it would be to maintain the process. Around four months into my weight loss journey (July 2021), I developed a very weird eating schedule. I would continue drinking the recommended daily amount of water, but I would stop drinking water and stop eating around the late afternoon because I noticed that this helped give me the best numbers on the scale when I weighed myself at night or in the morning. It's stupid because I know that I am still consuming the same amount of food and water everyday, but I was obsessed with seeing a smaller number on the scale.

I've more or less stuck to this pattern of not eating/drinking after mid-afternoon for the past year, minus a few exceptions here and there. Every single time that I eat/drink outside of that time frame, I notice that I weigh much more the next day, and it discourages me from doing so again. I tried to go back to a regular eating schedule for a week, and I ended up gaining some weight, which scared me away from trying again.

Hope 4 Recovery is a non-profit offering 100% free of charge peer-led virtual Zoom support groups and workshops for survivors of abuse &amp; sexual trauma. Support groups are limited to 8 members at a time, and once you join you can stay as long as you like. We also host monthly workshops to help provide survivors skills on topics like self-care, coping with PTSD, eating disorders, and dissociation.

**We welcome survivors (and** [volunteers](https://i.imgur.com/4GIvarq.png)**) worldwide, of any age (18+), gender, religion (or lack of), background, culture, orientation, or identity.** This is a Christian-based nonprofit, and many survivors have had concerns about the faith aspect prior to joining. Our community is NOT used as a platform for ministry, and only one group is faith-based (Faith &amp; Trauma). All other groups and workshops prohibit political and religious discussion.

Here's a link to our program offerings (details are lower on the page): [Hope Recovery Program Details](https://www.hope4-recovery.org/program.html)

We currently offer the following groups (all are mixed-gender except where noted, 1.5 hours each):

* Abuse, Bulimia &amp; Trauma Support Group \[Restricting/Binge/Purge Struggles\] (Sun &amp; Wed)
* Binge Eating &amp; Trauma Support Group \[Binge Struggles\] (Sun through Wed)
* Domestic Violence Recovery Support Group \[For Marriage &amp; Dating Relationships\] (7 days a week)
* Faith &amp; Trauma Support Group \[Christian-Based\] (Mon, Wed, Fri, &amp; Sat)
* Men's Survivor Support Group \[Cis Men’s-Only Supportive Space\] (Sun, Mon, &amp; Sat)
* NEW!! Trans &amp; Non-Binary Support Group \[For Trans &amp; NB Survivors\] (Sat at 2:30pm Est)
* Trauma Recovery Support Group \[General Trauma Recovery\] (Every day but Wed)
* Women's Sexual Assault Group \[Cis Women’s-Only Support Space\] (every day except Sun &amp; Thurs)

*At Hope Recovery we do NOT focus on the details of what happened.* The goal is to discuss how it affects us today and what we want to do (or are doing) about it. It is to process emotions, celebrate progress, develop new coping skills, and to share vulnerability with others who truly understand.

If you're struggling: [sign up to join a support group HERE](https://www.hope4-recovery.org/group.html). All groups have a 6-10 week waitlist except the workshops, Trans &amp; Non-Binary Support Group, and the Men's Survivor Support Program.

To volunteer: You don't have to be a survivor or in recovery (but if you are, your experience would be incredibly beneficial to our community). Your age, background, and education don't matter. The only requirements are empathy, communication skills, and a solid internet connection. [Sign up to volunteer HERE](https://www.hope4-recovery.org/volunteer.html). You can [see our volunteer flyer HERE](https://i.imgur.com/4GIvarq.png).

As a volunteer, we work with your availability &amp; you can choose which group(s) you want to run. There are two facilitators for each session. You’ll have to pass a background check and complete 10 hours of training. We ask for a 6-month commitment of just 2 hours per week. It's a very fulfilling experience and looks great on your resumé!

Your role is to open a Zoom room and help guide the conversation, do check-ins, ask questions, respond with empathy, and keep everyone civil and on-topic. There are two facilitators for every group so you'll never be on your own. Other duties include emailing the survivors the meeting link and updating an attendance roster. We also have 1 hour mandatory training every other month, offered on two different days to best work with your schedule.

Please feel free to reach out via message or in the comments with any questions or concerns.

,EatingDisorders,"My ED started at 15 years old I am now in my early 20’s and can now eat normally after therapy. But my case is rare because the type of eating disorder I have is phobia-based where my throat muscles are impaired as a result of a traumatic experience and it’s called phagophobia (fear of choking). All these years where I was suffering with phagophobia is my body being in a never ending fight or flight mode and it’s caused my throat to lock up.

My ED was kind to me because it allowed me to at least eat right after I woke up. My throat would normally start working again but only after I had a good sleep. No matter what I did, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, distractions. The only thing that allowed my throat to function again was sleeping, and to this day I don’t have an answer to why. I’d only have a morning meal and lived off of yogurt and pudding the rest of the day. If I’m lucky, I’d take a nap and then wake up and eat a meal again but that rarely happened.

,EatingDisorders,"I think I'm about to post shit that could be really triggering, so fair warning. 

I have a long history of being unsatisfied with my body in many ways and constantly comparing myself to others, and having disordered eating. 

I opened up to him last night and told him what my normal thought process is throughout my day. I wake up take my shower but stop in the mirror to obsess over things on my body I don't like. Convince myself I'm hideous and disgusting and no one likes me. I do this multiple times a day whenever I walk in front of something reflective. In public I make it less noticeable. I'm constantly thinking about the way I'm holding myself, or posing, or the way I'm perceived from other people especially men. Im not a hateful person, but my thoughts get the best of me and whenever I see skinny women I just can't stop thinking things like, ""they only like you because you're thin, you only have friends because you're thin, you're only happy because you're thin and everything gets handed to you because of it. I bet you eat whatever you want all the time and never gain a pound, stupid bitch, you don't deserve it. All of you waitstaff in this business or restaurant are all thin, that's because others only like thin people and will only hire thin people. Fuck off with you barely wearing any clothes and being completely flat, must be nice. Etc"".

If I'm not obsessing over shit like that, I have to deal with what I call ""the snake"" in my head. It's constantly feeding me shit like I'm disgusting, I'm a blob, no one likes you and you have no value because you're not thin, you are ugly, etc. I'm constantly thinking about food, in some way. I tell myself fuck it, who cares and get what I want or I tell myself you are fat and disgusting and you deserve to starve. It's always a push pull, and when I do impulsively eat things I shouldn't, I feel disgusting and I start purging. If Im able to successfully undereat Im proud of myself, but not too proud I make sure to verbally abuse myself because If I praise too much I feel like I deserve a reward, and I don't deserve one because I havnt accomplished anything yet. 

Once my day is finally over and I'm home, I have to look at my boyfriend. I love this little guy, but the problem is that he is naturally tiny, he can't gain any weight no matter what he eats, but he does have muscle and is toned. I think about how he deserves someone his size, he deserves better. I feel enormous next to him, and I can't handle when we are both naked looking in a mirror together I just want to cry. I end the day thinking about how much or how little I ate, I then berate my mind with insults and shit about it. I lay in bed and cover myself up quickly, but not before I take my hands and feel up my body and all the disgust I have for what I'm feeling. If I look at it i go numb with disgust.

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m not obsessing over shit like that, I have to deal with what I call &amp;quot;the snake&amp;quot; in my head. It&amp;#39;s constantly feeding me shit like I&amp;#39;m disgusting, I&amp;#39;m a blob, no one likes you and you have no value because you&amp;#39;re not thin, you are ugly, etc. I&amp;#39;m constantly thinking about food, in some way. I tell myself fuck it, who cares and get what I want or I tell myself you are fat and disgusting and you deserve to starve. It&amp;#39;s always a push pull, and when I do impulsively eat things I shouldn&amp;#39;t, I feel disgusting and I start purging. If Im able to successfully undereat Im proud of myself, but not too proud I make sure to verbally abuse myself because If I praise too much I feel like I deserve a reward, and I don&amp;#39;t deserve one because I havnt accomplished anything yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my day is finally over and I&amp;#39;m home, I have to look at my boyfriend. I love this little guy, but the problem is that he is naturally tiny, he can&amp;#39;t gain any weight no matter what he eats, but he does have muscle and is toned. I think about how he deserves someone his size, he deserves better. I feel enormous next to him, and I can&amp;#39;t handle when we are both naked looking in a mirror together I just want to cry. I end the day thinking about how much or how little I ate, I then berate my mind with insults and shit about it. I lay in bed and cover myself up quickly, but not before I take my hands and feel up my body and all the disgust I have for what I&amp;#39;m feeling. If I look at it i go numb with disgust. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my day. Im not entirely sure, I don&amp;#39;t know what to call this, but I think I have a problem. Maybe&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"So I row competitively with my school, I'm sixteen and going into sixth form at the start of the next school year. My sister was diagnosed with Anorexia and ended up in a facility for many months, and it was really distressing for her and the family. 

While she was doing this, I was struggling with myself. I threw up obsessively while continuing to push myself in my sport, despite low energy and feeling faint, and my decreased quality in performance.

I started rowing at a young age and was tall for my year group which made starting easier and was initially great for my confidence as I never excelled in a sport before.

Then it went downhill, in an obsession to not become what I viewed as fat, I began forcing myself to throw up, up to six times a day at the very peak. I managed to keep it unnoticed for just over a year before I told my school and parents. I didn't tell anyone because I felt I would be viewed as weak, and I didn't want to be a nuisance. My scores started plummeting, my rowing was in free-fall and I felt awful every day.

Now it's been out in the open for a month or two, and I've improved. I was diagnosed with bulimia, and then told I was misdiagnosed and had an eating disorder called RED-S, caused by my vomiting.

I only throw up about once a month, but my weight has increased substantially, in less than a month. When I saw this I immediately threw up everything in my stomach, that was Thursday, and I've thrown up daily now. I don't know what's happening and many feelings I used to feel are coming straight back into me. I need to know if it's normal, or if I should be worried.

,EatingDisorders,"Currently struggling, need a bit of wisdom from internet strangers. 

I’m eight years on my ED journey. 2020 and 2021 were hard for me because of the lockdowns, but I’ve recently worked really hard to put on weight and I’m proud of myself! 

However, I’ve recently been struggling to stay motivated and switch from “eat anything you can to gain weight and not starve” to “ok let’s eat healthier foods that you still enjoy but not ice cream for every meal.” But now I’m always looking at my body and scared I’m going to gain weight in places I don’t want to.

&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve recently been struggling to stay motivated and switch from “eat anything you can to gain weight and not starve” to “ok let’s eat healthier foods that you still enjoy but not ice cream for every meal.” But now I’m always looking at my body and scared I’m going to gain weight in places I don’t want to.

,EatingDisorders,"Female,24. So I had an ED and an anxiety disorder in High school and recovered well enough... so far so good. But a couple of years after that I was under a ton of stress, working weird hours and traveling a ton, which made me burn out, leading up to an evening when I called in sick everywhere and got stoned with a couple of friends. Being very tired, it literally took three puffs to turn me into a panicked blob, lying still on the floor (I have 0 memories of that, only remember the panic, but my friend used the word catatonic) and that was a very traumatic experience... Some days after that (I hadn't ben eating enough, but nothing too extreme) I got severe diarrhea and something like a constant panic attack. I stopped going out (completely) for fear of sh\*tting myself and/or dying of fear and embarrassment. I've been getting better, I go to work and do fun stuff sometimes(with a lot of anxiety tho). It's been 2 years, multiple diets to rule out food sensitivities, a ton of doctors, multiple meds, including, but not limited to:  escitalopram, lamotrigine(severe allergic reaction), sertraline, flupentixol, hydroxyzine and multiple herbal stuff. I take Imodium almost daily, lately I've been taking 2 a day. According to all doctors so far, nothing is  wrong with me, but the whole digestive shabang has been triggering me a lot(I've been able to withstand so far) BUT I've slowly but consistently been gaining weight(mostly due to the meds) for a while now, so it might all go to sh\*t soon, no pun intended.

So I had an ED and an anxiety disorder in High school and recovered well enough... so far so good. But a couple of years after that I was under a ton of stress, working weird hours and traveling a ton, which made me burn out, leading up to an evening when I called in sick everywhere and got stoned with a couple of friends. Being very tired, it literally took three puffs to turn me into a panicked blob, lying still on the floor (I have 0 memories of that, only remember the panic, but my friend used the word catatonic) and that was a very traumatic experience... Some days after that (I hadn&amp;#39;t ben eating enough, but nothing too extreme) I got severe diarrhea and something like a constant panic attack. I stopped going out (completely) for fear of sh*tting myself and/or dying of fear and embarrassment. I&amp;#39;ve been getting better, I go to work and do fun stuff sometimes(with a lot of anxiety tho). It&amp;#39;s been 2 years, multiple diets to rule out food sensitivities, a ton of doctors, multiple meds, including, but not limited to:  escitalopram, lamotrigine(severe allergic reaction), sertraline, flupentixol, hydroxyzine and multiple herbal stuff. I take Imodium almost daily, lately I&amp;#39;ve been taking 2 a day. According to all doctors so far, nothing is  wrong with me, but the whole digestive shabang has been triggering me a lot(I&amp;#39;ve been able to withstand so far) BUT I&amp;#39;ve slowly but consistently been gaining weight(mostly due to the meds) for a while now, so it might all go to sh*t soon, no pun intended. I guess my question is, has anyone experienced something similar, how did you deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"I have no idea where I am in my ED journey right now. I struggled with anorexia for about one year and started considering myself “recovering” a year and a half ago, which was when I eliminated all food restrictions (the last to go was intermittent fasting). I’ve gained weight since recovering, and a few months ago got a job as a receptionist for a gym. The latter was probably a mistake and while I love my job/coworkers, it’s only exacerbating the problem.

He does lots of juice cleanses and always wants to eat clean and he beats himself up over having a treat or if he eats anything that’s not just raw veggies and “clean”. She says he will sometimes just crawl into a ball and have breakdowns over how he looks. His self esteem is SO LOW. And I’ve known this, he’s got such poor self esteem.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared. 

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time.

•I keep having these constant, intrusive thoughts to secretly starve myself in hopes of losing weight.

•I obsess (I think I’m using this term loosely) over my dream body size.

•If I eat something when I’m supposed to be waiting, I’ll tell myself I’ll only eat one more but then keep going back.

•I inhale my food then feel sad/guilty when it’s gone. If I’m eating around others and I finish first I feel gross.

tw EDs i guess

my girlfriend had an ED before where she lost 60 lbs (actually to healthy weight) but the issue she's struggling to the point now where when she tries to eat, no matter how little it is, she throws it back up. and it's not like she can get professional help either because her parents are aware and they've threatened to send her off to a psych ward or something if it continues. we just feel that she's at such a hopeless point because neither she or i know what to do :( any advice or anything would be appreciated

,EatingDisorders,"SO basically my girlfriend has had body image issues and had a heavily restricting ED for the better part of 4 years. We met 10 months ago when it was very bad (frequent hospital visits and stuff) and since then it has gotten a WHOLE lot better, which I feel like I was a big part of and im really proud of her and myself for getting through it.

ANYWAYS to the point, when we met she was skinnier and now that shes eating more shes gained a little bit of weight. Not much but enough to where she doesnt fit into some of her old clothes and stuff. To me this is a good thing, and I really dont miss her being skinny at all, and I actually prefer her weight now as to what it was before, for reasons even beyond it just meaning shes doing better.

The problem is that I dont know how to be supportive and tell her how much I like how she is now compared to before, without it seeming like im calling her fat or chubby or anything, because shes really not.

,EatingDisorders,"TLDR; Eating is constantly on my mind, I can't go 10 minutes without thinking what I could eat now, have been feeling the effects on my back and knees of rapidly gaining weight. Want to start losing it again by working out but also change this mentality of always wanting to stuff myself whenever I get the opportunity.

Sorry for the vague title but I just don't know how to put it shortly. I've been a sweettooth my whole life, I like treating my taste buds with a cake, a pain au chocolat, or anything sweet. 

It wasn't that much of a problem in my previous years because I was growing, and I grew to be quite tall so I could eat back then without a lot of consequences to my weight. Soon after I stopped growing, the pandemic dropped which was a good thing for me because when I go outside and ride my bike to school, I usually pass a bakery and then I can't for the life of me ride past it without stopping for something sweet, that usually has a lot of calories, like a doughnut, pain au chocolat, maybe a tarte. 

Because of this and because the pandemic is starting to fade, or at least the mandates are non existent now except for in hospitals. I got quite a bit of weight in the past semester. I always tell myself at home to not stop at the bakery anymore every day, maybe once a week to treat myself but I always find myself stopping my bike and going in line to treat my taste buds once again.

Now this problem doesn't only occur when I'm riding my bike to my uni, but also at home. I'm studying for example but all I can think about is stuffing myself with food at times. This can be healthy food but also not so healthy food, I check the time every 10 minutes to see how close I am to lunch or dinner, even though I'm not that hungry. 

For now I'm overweight, but it doesn't really reflect on my body yet, except for my face which is getting a bit more fat and round, you can't really see my growing man boobies, my belly that is starting to become rounder too. This is mostly because I'm quite a tall and big built person in general, with broad shoulders and thick legs, which is a family trait lol.

My goal is to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem, I already decided to work out and go back to my original weight, but I also want to battle the mental side of this problem and stop my binge eating. When there are snacks in house like a bag of chips, it's always finished on the same day it was bought. 

My family genes don't favour me with a good back, nearly everyone in my family has severe back problems, my height and weight make me vulnerable to these problems too. I'm already starting to feel more pain in my back on a daily basis, running and walking hurts my knees and hips. 

Not only is this a problem to my body, but also financially, I spend like 120€ a month, just on snacks.

Soon after I stopped growing, the pandemic dropped which was a good thing for me because when I go outside and ride my bike to school, I usually pass a bakery and then I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me ride past it without stopping for something sweet, that usually has a lot of calories, like a doughnut, pain au chocolat, maybe a tarte. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this and because the pandemic is starting to fade, or at least the mandates are non existent now except for in hospitals. I got quite a bit of weight in the past semester. I always tell myself at home to not stop at the bakery anymore every day, maybe once a week to treat myself but I always find myself stopping my bike and going in line to treat my taste buds once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this problem doesn&amp;#39;t only occur when I&amp;#39;m riding my bike to my uni, but also at home. I&amp;#39;m studying for example but all I can think about is stuffing myself with food at times. This can be healthy food but also not so healthy food, I check the time every 10 minutes to see how close I am to lunch or dinner, even though I&amp;#39;m not that hungry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;#39;m overweight, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really reflect on my body yet, except for my face which is getting a bit more fat and round, you can&amp;#39;t really see my growing man boobies, my belly that is starting to become rounder too. This is mostly because I&amp;#39;m quite a tall and big built person in general, with broad shoulders and thick legs, which is a family trait lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem, I already decided to work out and go back to my original weight, but I also want to battle the mental side of this problem and stop my binge eating. When there are snacks in house like a bag of chips, it&amp;#39;s always finished on the same day it was bought. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family genes don&amp;#39;t favour me with a good back, nearly everyone in my family has severe back problems, my height and weight make me vulnerable to these problems too. I&amp;#39;m already starting to feel more pain in my back on a daily basis, running and walking hurts my knees and hips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this a problem to my body, but also financially, I spend like 120€ a month, just on snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I change this mentality of constantly wanting to eat something?&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 10 years and love her dearly. She has suffered from bulimia for the entirety of our relationship, plus a few years prior. I'm no stranger to the pathology of addiction and how difficult it is to overcome. I was an addict in the past and I have been surrounded by addicts my entire life. Of course an eating disorder is different, but its a different manifestation of the same beast. 

Through the years she has expressed a desire to recover but has never acted on it. I see her physical and mental health deteriorate in front of my eyes. It's extraordinarily difficult to watch someone I love destroy their body, mind, and soul on a daily basis. I'm a very understanding and rational person. I have never brought this topic to her with anything other than love, concern, and compassion.

Unfortunately I'm beginning to believe I will have to end the relationship. The truth of the matter is that an addict will never get sober for anyone other than themselves (not saying this negatively). I'd love to see her happy and healthy. We could live a long life together and raise children. With her current trajectory this future seems highly unlikely, if not impossible all together. Some days I just want to tell her I love her, then leave and never come back. Other days I want to stay by her side to support her (possibly enabling her I suppose).

,EatingDisorders,"Hello! My name is Hana Zickgraf, and I'm an assistant professor of psychology at the[ University of South Alabama](https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/psychology/faculty/zickgraf.html) and head of the HEART Lab (Home for Eating and Anxiety Research and Treatment). With some of my colleagues, I recently developed a questionnaire measuring accommodation of eating disorders. Accommodation happens when someone close to a person with an eating disorder changes their own behavior in order to reduce the stress of the person with an eating disorder, or to help manage their symptoms. Accommodation is done out of a desire to help, but sometimes it can have negative consequences, including caregiver burnout or slowing the recovery of the person with the eating disorder.

**You are eligible to participate if** 1) you experience disordered eating and are willing to send links to the study to someone(s) close to you to complete our new questionnaire, or 2) you are here because someone close to you has an eating disorder. [Please follow this link to participate](https://southalabama.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dgkXdZcb8LqpEkS). At the end of the survey you will be given a unique link to share with others. This will allow us to connect your responses to the data they provide. Participation will take up to 15 minutes.

After we have collected approximately 400 responses, we will close the study and conduct a raffle for twenty $10 online gift cards (you do not have to be in the United States to use the gift card).

,EatingDisorders,"Hi there, first-time Reddit poster, looking for some advice. 

I’m part of an artist residency for the month of June along with a fairly close cohort of 15 from lots of different backgrounds. We’re doing a lot of work together, and are sharing workspace, so spending a lot of time together- but also just met and don’t know each other’s stories very well yet. 

There is one woman in the cohort who very obviously has some kind of eating disorder. She is dangerously underweight and looks seriously unwell. She brushes off eating lunch every day. 

I had a brush with disordered eating in highschool, but have never dealt with anything this significant. I really want to be respectful and kind, and don’t want her to feel judged or self-conscious, but I don’t want to ignore what I’m seeing either. Im really concerned for her. She’s shared with the group that she isn’t in contact with anyone in her family except her sister, but that’s all I know about her support network. 

We have two and a half more weeks together in the residency. My question is- is it appropriate for me to say something to her/offer some kind of support getting help? And if so, what’s the best way to go about doing that?

,EatingDisorders,"tl;dr I’m a 26F recovering from EDs but living with a mother who is obsessed with weight and dieting for the new few months, and need tips on how to not fall back into ED thinking patterns. 

(throwaway account)

Hi, I’m a recovering anorexic 26F, living back in my parents’ house for the next few months and having a hard time trying not to fall back into ED thinking. My mother has always been very preoccupied with her weight (a cultural norm, unfortunately) and frequently complains about how fat she is. She at the lower end of healthy BMI and is objectively not fat. She announced some months ago to everyone that she is the heaviest she has ever been and is going on a strict diet. Since then she has noticeably lost some weight, but still calls herself fat (This kind of announced commentary: &gt;!“oh my God look at the thickness of my arm in this photo. Delete it!”, “I can’t bear the sight of my stomach,"" “I ate so much, I must have gained SO much weight today”, “I just weighed myself and oh my god i weigh X lbs, I’m going to skip dinner”, etc!&lt;). She weighs herself several times a day, and it's often before eating and after eating anything. 

I have secretly struggled with EDs since 6th grade and only recently got out of bad ED habits. I am at a healthy weight also at the lower end of healthy BMI but still struggle sometimes with body image and ED thoughts. I love my mother but her behavior is messing with my head and I know I’m in danger of losing all the progress I’ve made. Especially when she comments on my body (&gt;!I have relatively small calves, and she will frequently comment “oh my gosh look at those skinny calves of yours! I wish my huge calves were like yours”!&lt;)

I am stuck in this situation until I move back out in November. Meeting with a therapist is not an option (insurance complications, want to continue to keep this a secret from family).

i’m new here. i am 14f who struggles with eating. i have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but doctors do suspect i have atypical anorexia.

i lost quite a bit of weight for my age and was doing hours of cardio and not eating well everyday. i have ‘recovered’ a little bit (gained some kg back) but i’m in a constant restrict - binge cycle. 

i’ve noticed for the last 4 - 6 weeks i have EXTREME hair loss. it’s to the point where taking my hair out of a ponytail rips large clumps (bigger than my hand) out…. and i have big hands lol.

i washed my hair tonight and it was so bad that i couldn’t even brush my hair as i was drying it because it kept falling out. from not being able to brush, wash or dry it properly it is currently matted. fixable, yes, but brushing it to fix it will rip it all out. the hair loss is so bad that there are strands of hair hanging down from my ponytail that rip out large chunks of hair.

my parents are quite strict and aren’t happy with my whole situation anyway, if i tell them they will go insane. what can i do to help this? it’s so bad i’m scared of going bald.

,EatingDisorders,"Hello everyone,  


I recently joined this community, and I’m finding it helpful. Eating disorders are so often shrouded in secrecy, so it helps to have a space to share stories and experiences.  


I struggled with anorexia as a child, after my mother died when I was eleven. I was in and out of hospitals and residential treatment, then in “full recovery” for a couple of years, then fell into a ten-year cycle of binging and restricting that started in college.  


Since becoming a mother six years ago, I’ve done better in my recovery. I’m farther along than I ever imagined I’d be, but I still live with the disorder’s imprints. I’m in what I like to call “the middle place” — that liminal space between sickness and full recovery.  


I’m writing a memoir about my experiences, and though the book is primarily about my own story, I’m also talking with others about their experiences so that I can broaden my scope of understanding. It’s important to me to be mindful of the range of experiences that people face when struggling with, or in recovery from, an eating disorder.  


Along these lines, I’ve created a brief survey that I’m sharing with people who have experienced eating disorders. The questions are optional, and the information will be kept confidential. I would love it if those of you in this group would be willing to fill it out: [http://shorturl.at/mpCE4](http://shorturl.at/mpCE4)

,EatingDisorders,"I am a 58-year-old, 5'9"" F. I currently weigh 127 pounds. For decades I weighed between 190-220 pounds. 6 years ago, I divorced my husband of 28.5 years and magically the extra weight began to come off. While married, I would binge eat and then restrict. I was addicted to fast food and sugar, an alcoholic, and a major restricter (even though I was fat). The more calories I took in through alcohol, the less food I would eat. Once I left the husband and alcohol behind, it was easy to restrict and lose weight. Since I am in control of me now, I eat the way I want, or not. No one tells me what to do anymore. This newfound freedom has gotten me into a pickle. I am a professional chef and I work in the health field, and I look like a scarecrow. I give nutritional advice and prepare special beautiful healing food for people and can't manage to eat any of it myself. People tell me regularly that I am too thin. Even people I don't know. 

I have also spent the last year tapering off of Latuda, a medication for bipolar and anxiety that I had been taking for 6 1/2 years and didn't feel was benefitting me in any way. During the last six months of my taper, my OCD symptoms, which I didn't know were symptoms, (I just thought I was bat shit crazy all of these years) absolutely raged. I was crazy obsessed with mini-bingeing. I would drive all over my area looking for just the right little whatever (cakes, cookies, ice cream, lots of donuts and chips), purchase an armful of little goodies and then eat them in a certain order at a certain time, and yes, it was weird. Once my brain returned to 'normal' after my taper and my OCD diagnosis, the weird thoughts about food and eating disappeared. Except, for the restricting.

I am willing to possibly gain five pounds, but it is too difficult and I am not up for it right now. To gain muscle, I need to increase portion size, and/or frequency of meals, increase protein, and weight train. None of which I am willing to do right now, so I stay very thin. If I simply eat to gain weight, I will be putting on fat. I am not willing to do that. I also weigh myself every morning so that I know when to stop (eating). I have an extremely difficult time eating my own cooking. I mostly eat sandwiches and cereal at home and pick my way through the day at work. One day a week, I try to overeat and will eat a healthy meal, or two, and some ice cream. Today, I was determined to eat three times. I made a tasty gut-healing fresh juice for everyone and drank some myself and later made a protein smoothie, which I also drank. I felt great! And then, I noticed that I felt guilty for drinking the juice and the smoothie and was going to skip dinner because I didn't feel absolutely ravenous with hunger at dinner time. I was missing the light-headedness and brain fog that I usually had. That concerned me.

I have gone to my therapist. She is a very sweet food Normy and doesn't know how to help me. The psychiatrist who I used to help me taper off of my meds wants me to have a ketamine infusion and then have an intense psilocybin drug trip followed by intense therapy. WHAT?! 

I don't know what to do. I try to ignore it and I can some days. On other days I see the seriousness of my situation and really worry. Do I have an eating disorder or just disordered eating?

,EatingDisorders,"I feel very vulnerable and I might be putting out to much information so I will try to stay vague. I'm and girl and I'm trying to recover from a ED. I'm not yet a teenager and I feel stupid for even starting to stop eating. To be one hundred percent honest everything seems like a blur. I think I started getting self conscious about 2-3 years ago. I don't remember when I stopped eating but I remember that in health class we watched a movie about a girl with anorexia. She was already ""skinny"" and then she stopped eating to get skinnier. I was bigger than her and I thought that if I want to be pretty I have to look like her and be that small. I think that's where it all started. 

The first few weeks one girl pointed out I was not eating lunch and that scared me. It scared me that if someone did something about it I would have to stop. I started getting up earlier than everyone else in my family so I could get ready sooner. I pretend to eat and would say that I did before they woke up. I have a older sibling who plays sports so I was home alone a lot. This gave me the opportunity to skip breakfast lunch and dinner. Then everything came crashing down. 

My school has a system that tells you how much money your kid is spending on school lunch. My mom say that I had not bought lunch for like a month. The day she figured it out she called me down stairs and asked me about it. I lied. Or, at least tried. I first told her that it was wrong then she caught me in that lie so I said that it wasn't that long. I told her about the girl in front of me who gave me snacks (which was true) but I don't think she believed me and I don't blame her. I lied to her. Eventually I told her I was just not hungry which was partially true. Of course she knows I need to eat so she got me a nutritional chocolate milk dirnk thing that is supposed to give you energy. For lunch she would pack me a bag of grapes. That's what I told her the girl in front of me gave me. I started off drinking the drink for a while but I wasn't getting skinnier so I stopped drinking the mix. I went in this rotation so I would not get caught. I would make one and put it in the fridge but leave the trash out so it looks like I drank it and the next day I would drink it and leave the cup out. I didn't get caught. My siblings sport came to a end and I started eating dinner again. So I skipped lunch. 

I would give my food out to the people around me and not have to worry about it. I still do that to this day. This is very hard for me to say because nobody, not even people who know about my starvation, know that when I want to be skinny but I have to eat I will make myself throw up. This is on rare occasions but is becoming more more frequent. I started counting calories recently and found I need to be eating more. I don't like the amount I eat but it feels good. 

Today I have made the decision to change. I want to heal. I want my dream body but I want to work for it in a healthy way. That is main goal, to be skinny. I know it's going to take time and I have a lot of years to work on it but why not start now. I have done so much research but I can't find anything that quite fits what I'm going through. I know I'm not going to start eating and keep the weight off. Actually I want to gain some weight but I want to lose fat. I know this is a bit unrealistic but I want abbs and I know I'm going to have to work for it. 

Also I wear a mask to cover my face because I am self conscious. I want to stop caring but I just find myself so ugly. This might be a result of the desire of having a perfect body but I just thought I would throw this in here. 

So in summary I'm not yet a teen with a history of staving myself, from time to time binge eating, and making myself puke, who is a girl and I am wanting to get muscle in a healthy way and get a flat stomach. I think I want to stop calorie counting and focus on my health. If you have any advice or questions I will try my best to respond and take it to heart. I might have forgot somethings but I really need help. I'm not in the right mental state and I can't reach out to my parents or a therapist so if anyone can help that would be so appreciated. 

I'm sorry if this was offensive in anyway. I am not self diagnosing but I am just stating what is going on. Thank you for reading and I hope we all find a way to heal. I'm really going to try to stick to it.

,EatingDisorders,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for two years. I love her more than anyone and I care about her deeply. She has mentioned a few times casually in the past that she throws up her food when she eats too much or because she wanted to be thinner. She is aware that I don't like that she does that to herself and that I still find her attractive no matter what. She also mentioned that she intentionally threw up before one of our first dates together because she was worried about her appearance. She told me that her mother had confronted her on it in the past because she discovered that she could eat and not have to gain weight, but she continues to do it to this day. Most recently she told me she does it because she doesn't like the feeling of food in her stomach but she likes to eat. I suspected that this was the case, but I didn't think that she would continue to do it that often. Because she lives with her mother I thought that if I brought it up with her and suggested that my girlfriend see a psychiatrist or eating disorder specialist that she may have a better chance of getting the help she needs and receiving treatment. I've threatened to break up with her for continuing with her habits in the past but it seems that the problem is too far rooted for that to help. I even told her that I might tell her mother that she continues to vomit her food intentionally.

After I somewhat talked her out of it and she said she wouldn't bring up the subject anymore, I still feel that I want to help her in someway.

I&amp;#39;ve threatened to break up with her for continuing with her habits in the past but it seems that the problem is too far rooted for that to help. I even told her that I might tell her mother that she continues to vomit her food intentionally. She then briefly threatened me by saying that she would tell her mother something about me that I don&amp;#39;t want her to know. After I somewhat talked her out of it and she said she wouldn&amp;#39;t bring up the subject anymore, I still feel that I want to help her in someway. I&amp;#39;m afraid that if she saw a specialist that her illness may not meet the requirements for being diagnosed with bulimia nervosa because she may not engage in her self-destructive behaviour as much. Also that she may just lie about everything. Once again I love my girlfriend and anything I do for her whether it somewhat impacts her life or not, I would do it out of love. I just want her to get better. Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,EatingDisorders,"Before I share this post, I want to emphasize that this is my own personal experience and perspective. It's not my intent to judge anyone and I def do not want to come across as anti-recovery because that's not the case. Anyway, this post will contain a few points but I'll start with the broad questions/topics. 

1. Is IOP/PHP as strict as inpatient? Obvi i know it's diff in many ways but i guess i'm asking in terms of clothing and everything like that. like are there the same rules and stuff like no strings, no phones etc? I know it depends on the program but i'm just wondering if anyone has any experiences 
2. Has anyone been in child/adolescent care for their ED and then transferred to  the adult unit when they turned 18? I'm 20 y/o rn and I first met with a treatment team when I was 17. This was in Feb 2020 so right before the pandemic. I never actually started the PHP because I didn't want to miss school and it was also $$$ and also there is alot of conflict within my family so it wouldn't have been possible for me to do. 
3. This is the most controversial, but I have alot of trouble with the recovery dialogue. I don't know what it is, but sometimes it makes me so angry and uncomfortable. It's almost like it's condescending and infantilizing me. Like when people say to ""fuel your body"" it makes me feel as if I can only eat when my body needs fuel which is a tricky mindset to recover from/change. Again, this is my own perspective and inner struggle and it is not my intention to appear to be shaming anyone for having a different mindset than me. I just feel as if saying ""good job nourishing your body"" is the same as telling someone  ""good job pampering yourself"" after they wash their hands. IDK if this makes sense but it's something I struggle with and want to try and change my mindset.

For context, I'm a (nearly) twenty-three year old woman (moderately overweight, average height) living with my boyfriend, no children. We both have our issues with food. Mine is ED related, his is sensory related (picky eater with texture problems).

I had been eating a good breakfast consistently for over a month. Every day, two or three eggs and two pieces of toast (recently added a patty of sausage to that, leaning towards two eggs). However, I have started to hate it. Instead, I've been trying to eat cereal occasionally to help my stomach hate me less, but it's sugary and not good for me, neither does it tide me over to lunch time like the other breakfast. 

Additionally, I was also eating salads with chopped chicken for my work lunches, which did a great job filling me up, but now I dread it and gag at the thought. (I work as a delivery driver, and microwaves aren't always available.)

I do not go to the gym, though I want to. I want to be more fit. Not skinny necessarily, but skinnier with muscles and better endurance.


How do I eat healthy (or eat at all) when consistency kills my desire to eat food, leading to periods of fasting followed binges of garbage food from gas stations?

recently she’s started saying things that make me really uncomfortable, like “i haven’t eaten today” “if you eat after seven pm you’ll gain weight” “i wanna eat ___ but i don’t wanna get fat” and basically just stuff like that. earlier today she messaged on a gc that i’m in “guess who just looked up how to make themselves throw up” which is what really annoyed me. i wouldn’t mind as much if she didn’t know i struggled with eating, but she does know. you just don’t say stuff like that to someone with an ed.

also before i got diagnosed i’d tell her how i struggled with eating and body image etc and her advice was “you could drink water and chew gum to stop yourself from eating” even though that wasn’t the problem, the problem is i couldn’t eat.

,EatingDisorders,"I really struggle when my friends or people on social media who are in ED recovery, who often discuss treatment and their commitment to recovery etc. post bikini pics, outfit checks or just a pic of them in a bra or something just like a total body pic claiming it’s to help their self confidence when they are still at their LITERAL lowest weight. And I’m not trying to say that one’s existence or a picture of themselves is a trigger, nor should be censored or not allowed or anything. (But again these are like fully body pics, little clothes, specific angles, “body positive” posts etc.) As someone in recovery I find this really triggering to myself and my friend and I think it will only become triggering to them if they actually begin to gain weight in recovery and look back at those photos.

,EatingDisorders,"I (34/f) have two kids - 12f, 10m. I have struggled with binge eating all my life and am obese. It's not severe, but I do struggle with my relationship to food.

Now as a parent, I am dealing with the same thing in my 10 year old son and 12 year old daughter. I have no doubt I have passed some of my issues on to them. They've always been on the chubby side, but a recent move to a new town and the adjustment period has caused them some stress and both have gone from overweight to obese in less than 8 months.  It is killing both their self esteem and their energy levels. I have witness both of them binge eating - hoarding food, eating all throughout the night, sneaking and hiding food, eating HUGE amounts to the point of sickness in one sitting. I've known for a while that I needed to do something, and I started small. I tried talking to them, showing them how to healthily eat and that no food was good or bad, but some was unhealthy and okay in moderation. I got rid of soda, sweet tea and easy to eat snacks - began keeping fruits and veggies. The weight keeps piling on them. If I buy cheese sticks - they eat an entire bag in one sitting. If I buy ramen they eat 2 and 3 packs at the time. At dinner I have had to make a rule that if they want 2nds it will have to be veggies, because their first plate is so large and half full of whatever starch I cooked. 

Even more concerning, my son has wet the bed three times after having canned soda in the evening when visitng his aunt (she lives next door, he walks over JUST to get soda). Being pre-diabetic myself and it running in my family, I knew it was a possible sign of high blood sugar and began testing his fasting waking blood gluclose. It was 116, 113 and 112 on three different occasions. He has a doctors appointment to get that looked at, but I know, regardless, that we need to make a change, which leads me to the question: 

My kids are all for everyone in the house eating healthier - I am more than willing to literally get rid of everything unhealthy and easy to make in the house - and we can go out once or twice a week where they can have something they love -  but I have struggled with both my son and daughter staying up at night binge eating while I sleep. They will eat grits, pickles, cheese, bread, protien shakes, fruits, peanut butter from the jar, leftovers- ANYTHING that is not a veggie and doesn't have to be thawed out to cook is fair game. It's like they are STARVING - they are not. I don't deny them anything within reason (i dont let them snack before dinner or eat three meals between breakfast and lunch). I'm basically just trying to replace all of the foods I thought triggered them with healthier options. But the night eating is getting ridiculous. And honestly I can't afford it. My food bill last month was $1800 for a family of 5. 

My husband and mother suggested locking the fridge and pantry an night, but not restricting during the day - letting them eat all the healthy food they want within reason. But im concerned thats a little - controlling. Will putting locks on the fridge ONLY at night after everyone has been put to bed be too much? Is it too controlling?  Would it give them less control than just not keeping binge foods in the house? Do they need the sense of control, of feeling like they make the decision? Will the lock make them feel like they are being punished?

 Will it make them feel ashamed. I'm afraid my kids are on the cusp of developing the same issue that I have and I don't want to make it worse. How do I help them?

,EatingDisorders,"Tried posting here before but it didn’t go through so hopefully this time around I don’t break any rules… 

I have had weight problems since I was very young. I can’t put numbers in without getting flagged but I was around half-a-decade old when my parents got divorced, they moved into separate houses and both had to work a lot so at that age I started making my own food and was on my own a lot more than I should have been. I am now a young adult, and I am morbidly obese- everyday I try to start a diet, and everyday I fail “tomorrow will be better” once I have eaten the crappy food, whether it’s McDonald’s, Burger King, Domino’s… I feel gross, and I don’t even feel like it fully satisfied, I usually feel disgusting. The next morning I’m all phlegmy and bunged up because of all the cheese and the cycle starts again. 

I’ve lost lots of weight before, and I always gain it back. But right now I need to lose the equivalent of another normal sized adult, to be a healthy weight, and I can’t bring myself to start, because it’s such a big hill to climb… one more evening of crappy food is so much easier. My partner is in denial, says that she loves me the way I am and will continue to do so, and I believe her, that is the sort of person she is, but I don’t want to be bed ridden, or having a heart attack by 50 because I’m so unhealthy… but that doesn’t stop me eating a big bowl of cheesy pasta tonight. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s like I’m fighting my own mind every single day and the idiotic side always wins.

Trigger Warning: Binge eating, anorexia, bulimia, restricting, purging, binging, etc.


So I’ve had a binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember but I’m only now realising that that’s what it is. 
It started as a very young child and as a teen I started to hate how I looked and how much I ate etc. So I started spitting my food out and trying to eat as less as possible (wich didn’t really work out since I’m a binge eater) This slowly turned into anorexia 
Now I’ve been in recovery from the anorexia for quite some time now but I realised I’m binging again.
I have a lot of other mental health issues wich is why I’m on a waiting list for a psychiatry, but for now I have no professional to talk to
Obviously I would like to recover because the shame and guilt is horrible but it’s such a slippery slope, because for binge eating you would say eat less, think about what you eat, but I will slip right back into anorexia and vice versa
It just doesn’t seem to balance
Does anyone know what I can do? Or start to do on my own until I get acces to more help
