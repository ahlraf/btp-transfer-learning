,EDRecovery_public,"

long story short, i somehow spiralled into anorexia nervosa (formally diagnosed last week) about six months ago, from which I lost almost 20 kilos. I progressively felt more shitty both physically and mentally, and five days ago I convinced myself to recover. 

On the first and second days,  I experienced what I think was extreme hunger because I just couldn’t feel full and ended up eating about 2300-2400 calories.

The following two days I didn’t feel as hungry and ate 1400 and 1600 calories.

Today, again, I felt super hungry and only felt satisfied after 2300 cals. 

I’m worried that I’m going to gain weight if I keep eating this much. I realise that to be in recovery I need to practice not caring so much about the number on the scale, but I just want to maintain my current weight unless it’s from muscle gain. 

For context, I’m a 17 year old girl, 5’6-5’7 and I weight 114lbs. 
For these six months I’ve averaged most days at 600-700 calories a day and always clean unprocessed foods. 
I’ve been too weak to exercise during these months of restriction but with proper fuel in my body I want to become more active. 

Will I gain weight if I start consuming an average of 2000 calories a day given the information above?

Also, I read about hyper metabolism after periods of restriction?

I am seeing a specialised dietitian on monday but the doubts will haunt me until then, so here I am on reddit asking for your opinions/experiences.

For me the only way to break away from my messed up mindset about food was to get a plan, what to eat. I haven't been able to do it on my own, bc i always end up on a different diet like atkins, zone diet, low carbs etc etc. I have tried everything.

Now my mealplan is made by a doctor. Like a recipe to get healthy. I have a high respect for authority and when a doctor tells me to do something, i will do it. It also gives me a permission to eat, bc the doctor and nutritionist told me to do it. 

I feel that recovery is a real struggle. It feels good to eat normal food and i can feel my body starting to wake up. I still get dizzy, my stomach is like a balloon, i get cold or sweaty and the mental aspect is like hell.

I think that recovery for me would be so much easier if my body would not bloat. Bloating makes me feel like i have gained a ton of weight and is making my food choices more difficult. I have to eat a dessert every day. I'm finding myself to seek out the lowest calorie deserts like a fruit or the smallest candybar i can find, or skipping the dessert all together.. I feel i am slipping and i should take a grip. 

But as someone else just said here ""Every day is a new day to recover"". I feel that. It's like having an addiction and you need to make the same decision to recover every single day. No one else can understand what we are going through. People with normal attitude about food and eating don't understand the struggle and frustration we have.

Ever since I was about 14 I would cycle between not eating &amp; binging due to intense body dysmorphia and an obsession with junk food. Now that my chronic pain that I've also had since 14 is getting worse I've been seeing a doctor to figure out the root cause so I can hopefully manage it better, however, besides the testing I need for any potential diagnoses she told me that I need to lose some weight/eat better and start physical therapy. I'm really scared that I'm just going to obsess over it again like I have during past failed attempts to get healthy. To put it into perspective: I can't look at workout videos or straight/standard sized models anymore without getting extremely triggered, and I still have the horrible habit of body checking which only makes things even worse. I've always been overweight, and it was something I had just begun to start accepting while working towards body neutrality before my doctor threw a wrench in it.

Each relapse normally ended with some health scare (which I generally hid) or a broken bone.

This last September-November, I had the monster relapse I was nearly due for. Over the years my baseline weight tracked lower and lower and this relapse threw me to my lowest weight. I was also the most out of control, ritual obsessive, and depressed I had ever been. I became suicidal and began self harming. 

I did eventually come out of the episode after a broken toe and I worked on recovering but it was/is lingering longer than usual. I had gained 6lbs since then, had a stressful and lost it all a few days ago. 

I am disgusted by the way I look because  of how boney I am and how rough my face looks. I live in Canada and it’s cold and I shiver till I nearly pee myself anytime I’m outdoors. I’m also 6 foot and people stare at me and it makes me hyper aware that I look like slender man’s wife 

A small part of me wants to get help. But I have no idea how. Like do I call my family doctor and say “dude I’ve got problems I hid for 6 years” or am I supposed to contact a therapist myself? My school has counselors, are these the people for me?

Even if I were to contact my doctor, I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously or nothing gets done (I’m only a bit underweight). I also lied to him in the past because I had fainting spells and developed heart palpitations (after a fair size released) and it was a telephone call appointment because of COVID and I lied about my weight and failed to explain my circumstances.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hi guys! I’m a 19F who has had anorexia for a year. I have been recovering for the last 3 months. I have restored my weight and eat 2000 cals per day. 

About 6-7 months into anorexia, I started to see clumps of hair come out. Large chunks of hair from sections of my scalp would fall out. Once I started to enter recovery, the biggest difference I noticed is that less hair falls out. However, my scalp is still bare and “naked” in places where hair used to be. Before my ed, I used to have thick wavy hair and a lot of it too. Now, even after being in recovery for 3 months and the shredding stopping, my hair is thin and there is not much of it. I’m concerned that the hairs that fell out will not grow back and my hair will remain weak, and thin. 

For those of you who have recovered or know someone who has recovered: 

1. Did you grow back your hair to what it looked like before (thicker, healthy)?
2. What did you do to support the growth (diet, vitamins, oils etc)?
3. Will my hair grow back or is this demage permanent?

,EDRecovery_public,"Is this an okay diet for a 15 year old boy?

I'm scared I'm eating too much. 

I do intermittent fasting 5 days a week. I don't eat between 8-12. the reason behind this is to be able to identify when Im hungry vs when I'm bored. I don't think it's affecting my mental health negatively. I used to think about food all the time but now it's only on my mind a few minutes before mealtime. I feel much better.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I've been having anxiety about my diet, and just need a little bit of validation.

(On the weekends only) 

Breakfast:

2 instant oatmeal (plain) packs 

Banana

Peanut butter (1-2 tbsp)

Coffee with soy milk

&amp;#x200B;

LUNCH (every day)

Brown or white rice (1-1.5 cups)  
Lots of sauteed broccoli, cauliflower, tofu, and peas. (or tempeh) 

Snack  
Carrots and about 1/3 cup of hummus

More Coffee and soy milk (I like a lot of milk in my coffee)

Dinner 

Same as lunch

Dessert (I have every night since I fast in the morning)

About 1-1.5 cups of cereal with banana, peanut butter, and soy milk. On the weekends I have dark chocolate with this (One small bar - 160 cals)  


I'm currently at a weight that I'm happy at:

5'4

100-105 lbs

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm nervous I'm eating too much. I have too much soy milk and maybe too much rice. 

I also run four miles 4-5 times a week.

I relapsed in my ED during the start of covid and lost 15 pounds. In 2021 I made it my goal to recover my period and metabolism which had obviously been shot. The problem is I had to reach a weight I had ever been at in my life (+15lb) in order to do so. Even though I felt depressed everyday I continued with recovery trying to trust the process. \nIt’s officially been 10 months since Iv platued at this overshoot weight (1 year from committing to the process) and it is not coming off.

,EDRecovery_public,"So I’ve been suffering from anorexia for a really long time. And about a year ago when I started recovery and also started at at new school. At the new school I got a new friend, and after some time I was going to sleep over at here house. Neither of my friend or her parents new about my ed, but I decided not to tell them since I was doing really well in recovery and was really determined to recover. We were having dinner at her house, and I would say that the dinner itself went great. You should keep in mind that my friend is someone that doesn’t eat a lot, but I decided to not eat less than her (it was hard, but like I said I was really determined to recover) and eat a healthy amount. But after the dinner, her mom said to me: “I’m so glad that we have finally had a guest over that eats so much, it makes me happy to see that someone eats more then they need.” And like I know that the intention of that comment wasn’t meant to be harmful in anyway, but it made me relapse for a little while.

In the end it probably would have been a good idea to tell them about my ed before dinner so that they wouldn’t comment on the amount of food I was eating or anything like that, but I think you should never say to someone that they eat more than they need or comment on the amount (except if you’re worried for them of course, but then you should talk to them in private and not comment in front of everyone at the dinner table).

After that came another low, lost period again, and then boom, I decided to check what other disorder we got in the mix and developed a binge habit. Then right on top of the binge habit came the realisation that I can get rid of the dinner of 4 I have just consumed via toilet. What a fucking breakthrough, it set me up for a bulimia-ish period. I always end my binges with a fresh new plan to get better. To eat healthier. To maintain my weight, which is perfectly healthy. To make peace with food, to banish it from my thoughts. I don't want to wake up and calculate my day in my head. I don't want to starve an entire day before and after a night of heavy drinking, only to end up binging. I want to get my energy back, my thoughts back. I really really wish, from the bottom of my heart, that every single person who struggles with eating related problems manages to find a way to roundhouse kick that shit. It is unbeleivably hard to accept that you are no longer ""skinny"". You don't get the comments or the high from restricting. You no longer have the safe little mental palace built of lies and numbers and low calorie recipes. Or maybe it isn't like that for you. Maybe you are struggling because your only solace is food, maybe you are binging beacuse your Palace is made of hatred towards yourself. 
All I can say, that this entire system of addiction, fear, safety and hatred we built around food is only in our minds. Guys, we have no idea how many treasures this world holds once we leave the fucking mental palace and turn towards life, not EDs.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hi everybody, 

I'm 18 almost 19 and have only had an eating disorder for a few years but it has completely taken over my life and I've finally decided to take control. I needed to find people who were going through the same situation as me so that I could have a good support system. I just really need to vent right now though and I hope that you guys will listen. 

I am avoiding scales at all costs, however my shower is currently getting the caulking redone so it needs time to dry out before anyone can use it. Because of this I am using  my parents bathroom where they have a scale. I have avoided it for three days but I finally caved in tonight and saw my weight. I used to weigh 145 and I got that number down to 115, so when I saw that I was 117.8 I cried, and I cried hard. To me, every number that is only a little larger than my lowest weight feels like my highest. 117 is no longer 117, because 117 is pretty close to 120, and 120 is pretty much 140, which is almost 145. In my mind I know that I am below my bmi and am close to being at a normal weight, but parts of me still believe that ""I'm big"" and ""I can't do what I did today, tomorrow"". I need to be able to stop these intrusive thoughts. The only reason I stepped on the scale was because prior to my shower needing to be fixed, I hadn't stepped on the scale for a month or so.

,EDRecovery_public,"i’d like to say back in February/March was when my eating got bad. I had just got out of a very bad relationship which led to me barely caring about myself. I basically used to binge eat a lot of fast food and unhealthy stuff. It wasn’t until August where it backfired. I had severe heartburn and temporary acid reflux causing me to be very restrictive. My doctor noticed the weight drop from when I recovered from that and obviously raised the concern about my old ed relapsing ( I used to be very restrictive in the past years). my girlfriend was in the room with me when that was mentioned so basically ever since the end of August, I have been recovering with the help of her and also some friends. It’s been about 2 months. The first month was easy for me only because I was determined and also because my metabolism wasn’t able to keep up with me. Little detail, I have a fast metabolism which is what triggers the spiraling affect of my ed mostly because I will give up with trying. Now that I am in the second month, it is getting hard again. My metabolism has definitely caught up with me. Eating 3 meals a day with a couple healthy snacks doesn’t exactly do much. It’ll stabilize my weight but it doesn’t go up. The biggest thing that interferes though is that I work in the performing arts, specifically dance. I do eat healthy meals for the main 3 which works fine. The issue usually is between lunch and dinner. I am back to full out working and rehearsing things, so it’s not that easy to eat something then go back to what I was doing because it would be easy to make myself sick. I’m not sure if anybody else works a job like that, but if anybody has ideas or advice of what I could eat during that time period that also helps me get more calories, feel free to comment. It’s been beating me up a little bit mentally because I want to be able to get ahead of my metabolism since I’ve spent years letting it cause me to be underweight for years. Even if you have any tips to naturally slow it down that’ll be nice.

No one in my life had ever heard of anyone going to treatment for their ED, or at least no one ever talked about it. My teachers were so confused with what to do but I guided them even through my mania. I guided everyone through this on top of doing it for myself. It was so uncomfortable, so emotionally exhausting and physically too. I never thought I’d get out of feeling so shitty, full of anxiety and anger.

I've been meaning to put forth this inquiry for long now as the effects described bellow have been nagging me to the core for the past year.

Context:

2018 summer, recovery from ANA;
2019 - 2020 academic year, second ANA case;
2020 summer, recovery from second ANA;
2021 winter, three-month BN case;

Since my first recovery in 2018, I've had enlarged submandibular (located under the jaw) salivary glands that haven't shrunk even till today. I do not feel pain, it is the case that their presence aesthetically unpleasant. 
I could live with them, until last year's autumn, when I gained back to my pre-2017 weight and since then I'm devoured by the hatred that has become the lack of a jawline. I used to have it even with the weight that I am at currently. It's been five months since often purging has seized (with infrequent purges happening twice a month now in worst cases) and I am confused and troubled.

My question is:
What has happened here with the chin-jawline area? Have I messed up my face physiology and will now have a double chin for the rest of the time, where there used to not be one? Or is this still the aftermath of BN recovery (though, then I'm troubled by the little time that I had purged and whether that had such a profound impact for so long)?

iv'e had an eating disorder (anorexia) for the last 3 years, and i was able to successfully recover from it the same year i started to eat and exercise unusually, but a few months later i relapsed (from 62 kg), started recovery (up to 66 kg), then relapsed again. this made me gain a lot of weight from previous recovery attempts and i would always lose that weight in a very short amount of time by severely restricting myself. 

i tried to fully commit to recovery this past year but when i started to gain a lot of weight (74 kg) i got really worried and now im in quasi-recovery. my body still wants food and i still have extreme hunger but how is this even possible if im overweight? im scared that if i continue im going to have health problems. 

i had many false alarms in the past where i thought i finally recovered because i thought i didn't have extreme hunger anymore, and now im losing hope and im so tired of feeling so insecure

,EDRecovery_public,"To sum everything up quickly, I have struggled with EDs since 2015. I've been diagnosed with two and I'm on my second try at recovery, and after today I feel embarrassed that I am recovered. 

Today my boyfriend and I went to a clothing store, since recovering I don't have a ton of pants that fit comfortably, and he also needed new pants. I found a pair I liked, but felt as if the size was super small, even though the number felt too big. So, for the first time in a long time I went into the fitting room. I was stressed, as they're just not a good place for me. But I was pleasantly surprised when the pants fit me perfectly. I was even a little excited and didn't bother to shop anymore, as I was happy to have had that kind of luck right away. 

We go to check out and that's where it all went to hell. We're cashing out and the cashier asked us how far along I was. I literally felt my heart drop to my heels. My boyfriend spoke for me, but the second we stepped out into the parking lot I started crying and am still really upset. I feel too recovered now and couldn't finish dinner, as I was gagging a third of the way through. I still have a lot of struggles with body dysmorphia, but up until now I've been great with dealing with it. Now it feels like I look the way I thought to everyone else too and I feel so disgusting. I liked the dress I wore today a lot, and have only worn it a few times, but I honestly don't plan on wearing it again.

I'm sorry for the way this is typed, I'm on mobile and didn't pay much attention to it anyway. I just needed to get it out to anyone that would listen.

My meal plans have been changing slowly; the biggest challenge for me was an eating schedule. Once I got that down mostly, only then was I given a new plan. 

Well, my most recent plan included an huge fear food of mine: peanut butter. Now don’t get me wrong, I LOVE peanut butter. I just haven’t eaten it in so long because I avoided it. I am still deathly afraid of it, but I can’t stop eating it. And I can’t purge it either because I’m working on cutting down my purging and, well, if you know you know. 

Anyway, peanut butter was only added to my plan maybe a week ago. I’ve already gone through THREE FULL JARS. THREE. It’s like my body and brain are just screaming at me to eat it. I’m binging on it nonstop, and I’m NEVER full. 

And you know what’s weird, I don’t crave the same foods I would typically b/p on. It’s like none of those matter anymore. I can have my regular meals and I still want that peanut butter (and sometimes whipped cream). It’s like my brain knows I can’t purge this, it’s going to stay down, and that it’s craving fat.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hi! Massive apologies in advance for this rant, I'm very panicky and I just needed to rant in a space where people will understand that I'm aware its irrational and makes no sense but also can't think a different way right now, so I could calm down and sort myself out lol

So I'm trying to recover after a massive lockdown triggered relapse last year, and I WAS doing really well. But I'm also moving country and just got put in a strict mandated isolation facility which is fine ofc, I knew what I was getting into, and I made sure I did loads of research and had a plan to cope because if anything could relapse me, locked in a small room with limited exercise opportunity and no control over my food is a def risk. The plan has a few aspects but really hinged on me renting a crosstrainer for my hotel room, which the website for these facilities said was allowed and I found a rental that would do it.

Facility rundown - I got a menu and was able to select foods for the next two weeks. I chose the healthiest lightest options and opted out of desserts. I calculated the first two days as best I could and even then I'd say we're looking at \~2000kcal a day. My MAINTENANCE when I am ACTIVE (locked in a hotel room so not so much here...) is 1800. So ofc I'm freaked out and made a plan to obvs just eat certain bits, leave things like rice etc out. I'm allowed half an hour outside a day but I am not allowed to run. My room is small and I can fit the xtrainer and could slide it aside to do insanity but cant really run in here or get meaningful walking pace. 

(Note here.. I have behaviours associated with exercise. I workout obsessively but my brain refuses to count anything as calories burned UNLESS IT IS A CROSSTRAINER OR A TREADMILL. Like I can literally run for an hour outside but if I'm not on a machine no matter how much I consciously KNOW I burned calories, my brain will just.. nope. Not on a machine, doesn't count. 0 calories burned do an hour on the treadmill/xtrainer). 

Treadmills I lkterally have to use for 90-120 minutes before my brain counts it but for reasons unknown to me as to why this is a thing, x trainer I can use two lots of 30 mins in a day and I'm fine. So my plan so I could eat was: yoga am, 30 min xtrainer heavy cardio am, shaun t insanity workout, and then just ''walk'' gently with no resistance on the xtrainer all day while watching tv or whatever so I'm in motion. then 30 min cardio again before bed. 

Hotel just denied me the xtrainer. I was so confused, website said it was allowed and they've just turned around and said I can't have it. What really pisses me off here is I had a welfare meeting on arrival where I was very clear about my issues and concerns and specified I was hiring a xtrainer and the nurses were like 'yep thats fine keep us updated on how you're doing'. So this ofc just sent me into complete panic mode. Now they've said I can hire an exercycle. Obviously I have immediately changed my order and I won't hear back till tomorrow if they have one available and I'm really hoping they do but if they don't I'm fucked. Even if they do my stupid ed brain which is now in total overdrive will refuse to consider it as calories burned and the only option I can see is to call the kitchen staff and ask them to not send me any food.. or just not open my door to get any or chuck it all or don't eat it and spend all day every day doing fuckin insanity videos and cycling as fast as I can on a bike.

I'm just straight up freaking out at this point, I know once I calm down I can reassess and I'll call the nurse to talk about what to do but I really needed to get it out, sorry guys.

Hey, does anyone have advice on how to recover from your ED while living in a house with a restricted kitchen? 

My grandmother has really bad untreated ocd and polices the kitchen and will scream at anyone who ""makes a mess"" in her kitchen. The only time anyone is allowed in the kitchen is when my mom cooks dinner and she is only allowed to cook what my grandparents want. I have been struggling to eat for the past 6 months, 4 and a half of those months I lived on my own but now I am back living at home. I thought it would be better cause someone else was cooking but since my mom only cooks what my grandparents tell her to it's been even harder to force myselfto eat. All my grandparents wants to eat is usually really heavy foods (pizzas, pasta, fried/breaded foods, beans, tacos) that I can't make myself eat. 

I am a adult with my own money but I can't drive so can't shop for food myself or go out and get something. The one time I tries to use doordash to order something I was yelled at for ""being ungrateful and rude"" because I didn't order everyone food. 

If I lose anymore weight my doctor will make me go to treatment and I don't have the money for that. And not only that, but I also promised my girlfriend I would start eating again and I really want to keep that promise it's just so hard when I can't even go into my own kitchen without getting screamed at

i don't really have a social life or friends to (impress) or  social activities it's just me and my cats , so why i am doing this to myself ? because of my family and their treatment and childhood trauma and other stuff that i won't be talking about here .

,EDRecovery_public,"I’ve been in recovery for almost 6 months now. I’ve struggled so much and I’ve had many lows, but I’m still trying. I’ve grown more comfortable being around friends and going out, but I still have my moments. I mostly only talk to my therapist about my issues, but my friends are aware of what’s going on. It’s hard to talk yo them about it, because they just don’t understand and I honestly don’t want them to. I don’t want them to ever know what’s it’s like to think this way. I don’t want them to mimic my behavior or ever feel as weak as I do. I try to just hold it all on when I’m around them, because I want to have fun. I want to feel like myself again, I want to escape it. I’ve been doing well recently, and I feel confident in the strides I’ve taken, but I’m still seeking so much validation. There was a situation with my roommates that made me feel uncomfortable at home, so I told them how I felt. I told them ghat the situation made me feel uncomfortable and it completely backfired. One of my friends immediately starting talking about how it wouldn’t have made her feel uncomfortable and so forth. It felt like a stab to the chest. I immediately felt so belittled and insecure. Like I was weak and idiotic for being uncomfortable. I got so defensive and snapped at her and told her how belittling she always was to me. The conversation shifted into the subject of my ED and I broke down. My friend later told me that she needed a break and that I was affecting her in a negative way and that I needed more help and that she was worried about me. She said that she couldn’t do it anymore and she needs a break. 
I feel so hurt and confused. I don’t share my issues with her often at all, I try to keep it all to myself.

I’ve struggled so much and I’ve had many lows, but I’m still trying. I’ve grown more comfortable being around friends and going out, but I still have my moments. I mostly only talk to my therapist about my issues, but my friends are aware of what’s going on. It’s hard to talk yo them about it, because they just don’t understand and I honestly don’t want them to. I don’t want them to ever know what’s it’s like to think this way. I don’t want them to mimic my behavior or ever feel as weak as I do. I try to just hold it all on when I’m around them, because I want to have fun. I want to feel like myself again, I want to escape it. I’ve been doing well recently, and I feel confident in the strides I’ve taken, but I’m still seeking so much validation. There was a situation with my roommates that made me feel uncomfortable at home, so I told them how I felt. I told them ghat the situation made me feel uncomfortable and it completely backfired. One of my friends immediately starting talking about how it wouldn’t have made her feel uncomfortable and so forth. It felt like a stab to the chest. I immediately felt so belittled and insecure. Like I was weak and idiotic for being uncomfortable. I got so defensive and snapped at her and told her how belittling she always was to me. The conversation shifted into the subject of my ED and I broke down. My friend later told me that she needed a break and that I was affecting her in a negative way and that I needed more help and that she was worried about me. She said that she couldn’t do it anymore and she needs a break. 
I feel so hurt and confused. I don’t share my issues with her often at all, I try to keep it all to myself. It’s still so hard to make sense of what’s going on in my mind, I can’t seem to trust my feelings. It’s one thing that I’ve been really struggling with. I keep seeking validation from others.

,EDRecovery_public,"so some background:
i have been in therapy for the past year and it was really great:) i just had my last session this week because i’m going on a 4 (ish) month road trip so continuing treatment wasn’t an option but i feel like i ended it in a really good place. generally i’m happy rn. i think. 
i talked a little bit about my body image and disordered eating habits with my therapist but only a few times because he doesn’t specialize in eating disorders. he expressed concerned when i told him about what i was doing at my worst, and how i was doing currently. then he checked in a couple more times in the past three months since i’d told him. 
so here’s the dealio:
i’m so worried about “relapsing” (quotation marks because i’ve never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder) into my old habits. i automatically have a limited diet for the road because of space and money and i know that i’ll be hiking a lot and there’s a really high chance my weight will go down and then i’ll go back to harmful behaviors to keep whatever lower weight i end up at. 
there’s a chance nothing will happen but i’ve only recently (past 3-4 months) been eating three meals a day and not counting coffee with milk/creamer in it as a “meal” 
i already feel my skin crawling at the thought of it. no ones going to be with me to see if i eat or not and i’m so scared that i’ll just wreck my body. i want to be healthy and happy and love my body. eventually i want to talk to a ed specialist if not to get a diagnosis just to get some advice.

i have been in therapy for the past year and it was really great:) i just had my last session this week because i’m going on a 4 (ish) month road trip so continuing treatment wasn’t an option but i feel like i ended it in a really good place. generally i’m happy rn. i think. 
i talked a little bit about my body image and disordered eating habits with my therapist but only a few times because he doesn’t specialize in eating disorders. he expressed concerned when i told him about what i was doing at my worst, and how i was doing currently. then he checked in a couple more times in the past three months since i’d told him. 
so here’s the dealio:

If they tell me to wait until next Friday, then I&amp;#39;ll starve myself all the week and then binge because &amp;quot;if it&amp;#39;s not now, I won&amp;#39;t be allowed to eat this&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I could eat one damn piece of cake and don&amp;#39;t feel guilty about it and don&amp;#39;t wanting to binge neither. Now I wish I ate it all so today I&amp;#39;ll feel sick of it. &lt;/p&gt;

,EDRecovery_public,"Hi, this is my very first Reddit post despite having been on the site for years (my account was created only recently). I am brand new to this subreddit because I have been very steadily recovered for over 2 years at this point. Honestly, I consider myself very lucky as my recovery has been fairly smooth with minimal bumps and bruises in between. I won’t go to into my past because I’d like to keep this short and get right to the point.

This past week has been a bit rough for me mentally and emotionally and I have recently begun thinking heavily about my weight and food. This is super surprising to me because I have not had these kinds of thoughts for at least a year. I am disgusted with myself because, put bluntly, I WANT my ED to come back. It makes me angry to even type that. I can’t explain it very well. I am upset because I have worked hard to get to this point. I have worked hard to dismiss my old mindset and move on from the past and yet, I feel myself willing to go through all it again just so I can be underweight. 

Here are somethings I think have recently triggered me:

-Because I have been confident in my recovery, I have been following the subreddit r/EUGENIACOONEY for a bit now. have never seen her as thinspo and it was never my intention to see her as inspiration. Having gone through an ED myself, I just find it fascinating to see someone so publicly go through one. The comments on the subreddit also point out the awful health side effects of not treating your body right, which I actually see as inspiration to stay recovered. Still, seeing this content has made me more aware of the ED mindset I have in the back of my head.

-My old friend who openly has an ED has started to drop weight. We don’t talk anymore, but I still see her occasionally at school and I can tell she is going through a rough patch right now. For some reason I am beginning to see this as some sort of challenge. I almost want to prove to our mutual friends that I am “sicker” than her. That I can practice more self discipline.

-I recently told this guy I’ve been dating that I love him. He said it back and I felt on top of the world. I have been open with him about my past history with my ED and he was very understanding and caring and sees no reason to be concerned because of how well I’ve recovered. Knowing that he loves and cares for me as much as I care for him has made me want to be the best version of myself possible. I’ve started to think that he deserves me “dainty-er” and skinnier. I have no idea why I have begun to correlate my self worth and “lovable-ness” with my weight again.

I am curious about any thoughts/comments on this and if anyone has had a similar experience deep into their recovery. Any advice is also welcome! Thank you guys.

The past couple years I hadn't been eating much due to being depressed and not having much of an appetite. I used to never eat breakfast, often skipped lunch, and usually just ate a few snacks in place of it. I'd almost always eat dinner though. 

Now I'm eating a small breakfast on workdays, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between meals (basically I'm actually paying attention to when I'm hungry). At my lowest weight I was like 92ish pounds. I'm now 100-103ish. Some of it's water weight so it's hard to tell how much I've actually gained but I've gained around 5-10ish pounds in the past month or two. None of the weight gain really seems visible and my clothes fit about the same.

I'm trying to recover from an ED.

Lately I've been struggling with weight gain. I am actually afraid of it but I'm trying not to let that slow down my recovery. So far, I've generally been avoiding mirrors and tight clothes so as to not be triggered.
Does anyone have any tips on how do to deal with my fear of gaining weight? 

I also experience light dizziness for some seconds to a minute almost daily for the past 2 weeks or so. 
Did anyone go through that or should I worry?

I’m never sure what is triggering or not so I apologize in advance and let this be a warning. 

I’ve struggled with eating habits for roughly 12 years now (I’m 22). In the beginning it started with binge eating because of cultural norms and coping with bullying and family dynamics. At the age of 13/14 I hated myself for have always been overweight and being incredibly self conscious I started skipping meals.

I’m a 35 year old mother, for context. It took my doctors way too long to realize that an ED was one of my problems, and I wasn’t underweight *because* of my health problems, but that I developed those problems because of long-term erratic eating, sleeping, and stress patterns.

I only spoke the words “eating disorder” to my husband of 10 years a few months ago. It took him a long time to adjust to it.

Now I’m facing my food issues head on. It’s mental and physical; I don’t want to eat because I like how I look when I’m under-eating, and also because large amounts of food makes my body feel more horrible than minor starvation.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hear me out. I’m going to make my long Ed story short. ***tw I’m going to be talking about my eating disorders, numbers. If you are still recovering or could be triggered, don’t read.

I’ve suffered with every eating disorder throughout my life. It started off healthy, just trying to work out and lose some healthy weight. I spiralled into bulimia (b/p) when I was 16 for a good 1.5 years. Then I went vegan, became orthorexic and addicted to excercise. Then, restriction began. I suffered with restriction and anorexia for years later, with occasional b/p relapses. (I really hated this, and I tried my best not to because it made me feel horrible) when I began college, I started to finally recover, finally see the light. I started to eat what I wanted, workout freely, eat with others, not be so strict but once again my ed slowly crept up on me. I was rigid with my intake, never ever ever ate past 6/7pm, and had a strict workout routine. When I moved back home, things changed and I began eating less, working out more. I lost tons on weight, and felt burnt out. I HATE how I was and have always been strict with my routine/timings. Can never eat dinner before 7 or past8, before it was 5 then 6, etc. 

Now, I tend to over exercise (sometimes I could just walk on the treadmill for like 6 hours a day) and eat my dinner, and binge at night. Absolutely go off. 

I’m so tired of this. I just need someone to talk to. It’s hard to open up fully to others. I’m ashamed. 

It doesn’t help that my boyfriend is extremely flexible with his food and doesn’t have any set times for his eating, just goes with the flow.

,EDRecovery_public,"TW: anorexia, calories, suicidal thoughts 

My eating has been disordered for almost 3 years on and off, but the last period I got was 5 months ago- I was admitted to treatment and diagnosed with anorexia 4 months ago. 
I lost a lot of weight quickly, from being borderline overweight for my height right down to the underweight for my height (only underweight by a couple kilos but the very quick drop is probably what made my period stop) 
Anyway, my doctors have told me that my period probably won’t come back until I’m at the weight I was when I lost them, which is about 5/6 kilos away from where I am now. 
Shockingly, today, I went to the toilet and realised I got a period - very very light but still it was there. (My periods have always been super light and last for a day or two). I am so so confused as I technically shouldn’t be getting my period as I am still borderline underweight? Has anyone else experienced this? 
It’s kinda fucking me up cos I was not expecting it to come and it was one of my goals to motivate me to gain... but now, when I’m still in a major caloric deficit which hasn’t changed for 6 months straight (it’s still my meal plan set by my doctors but because my body’s not used to large intake their slowly building it up, but we’re still at the lowest meal plan of and haven’t increased yet as I haven’t been able to), I have already got it back so I’m absolutely terrified of gaining or eating more than I currently am. 

Please help or say something or relate because I’m really struggling. Now that I’m on antidepressants which are working, my suicidal thoughts have calmed down giving my anorexia way way more time and space in my mind and it’s exhausting.

,EDRecovery_public,"TW /// binge , bulimia (TLDR at the bottom)

Hello all, first time poster here. I feel very dumb but I haven't found the rules for this sub (not used to reddit) so I sincerely apologize if my posts breaks any of them.

I'm a woman recovering from bulimia / binge ED and I'm in a place where I'm almost completely fine mentally in regards to the ED. It's been several years now since I had a bad episode.

However, I gained a lot of weight because of binging, and even though I lost some of it when I stopped, I'm still very overweight. I'm in this dumb situation where you have to lose weight to be healthy but you're too scared you'll fall back into your dangerous habits. I get anxious even just thinking ""I have to exercise a little for my health"" because it just gives me flashbacks to when I was deep into my ED. I'm trying to come up with reasons to exercise and eat healthy OTHER than losing weight, that way I can focus on those reasons instead.

Anyways, here's the problem  I recently noticed.

Whenever I see a woman who looks fit and beautiful in my eyes, I get the urge to binge. I would look at instagram or at a YouTube video and see a pretty girl, think ""damn, she looks good"", and then immediately get up and go eat an entire pack of cookies. It didn't occur to me that those actions might be connected until not too long ago. You'd think ""duh, classic case of comparing yourself to these girls and that triggers your ED"". But...

The thing is, I am attracted to women. so when I do this, I just think I'm checking them out. I didn't even feel like I was comparing myself to them. But I think deep down, I can't help but wishing I looked like them as well. The binges are not extreme compared to what I experienced in the past, which is why it took time to dawn on me that that wasn't healthy.

Does this happen to anyone else? What do you think could help with coping? I can obviously limit my Instagram intake (I have been unfollowing a lot of models or celebrities that I noticed made me feel bad about myself) or even delete it completely, but there are still a lot of pretty girls out in the everyday world and it would be unrealistic to think I can just avoid all triggers.

TLDR: Recovering from binge eating disorder, get urges to binge automatically when seeing pretty girls. Anyone else in this situation?

Thanks in advance guys.",t2_58cj5hjt,False,,0,False,"This is making recovery difficult for me, has anyone else experienced this?",[],r/EDRecovery_public,False,0,,0,,False,t3_kmqc1g,False,dark,1.0,,restricted,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1609286605.0,text,0,,,text,self.EDRecovery_public,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW /// binge , bulimia (TLDR at the bottom)&lt;/p&gt;

,EDRecovery_public,"
I feel so hopeless. I've been in recovery for the past month  and gained a lot of weight. First two weeks I was ""All in"" and then started to eat more healthy. However, I still experience extreme hunger even when I am at normal BMI. Ive been eating healthy for almost a week (proper 3 meals and 2 snacks), but now I got an extreme hunger episode and all I can think of is pizza, ice cream and chips. I feel so fat after gaining 10 pounds and I am scared to meet my friends or see people that I know, because I am embarassed. I believe that they will just think that Ive let myself go. Its also hard that my clothes do not "" hang on me"" anymore and you cannot see my abs or bones peeking through. But at the same, i just want to eat and get these thoughts of food out of my head.

I only ever traveled to asian countries where all the guides said ""the food here is so much healthier than america you're sure to lose weight! there's so much walking and standing too\~""

by the end of my second summer abroad I had gained about 30lbs to be 150lbs in a little over a year. By the end of my first trip to japan, none of the clothes i brought with me fit anymore. Same by the end of being in hong kong. i felt like a vile gelatinous blob and always sick, my stomach hurting or my nose running or something.

but i love being abroad, i loved the places and people and food and it feels like home to me

In america i am thin and average height with a nice build.

I weigh about 54-55 kg (120-123ish lbs) and am 169-170 cm.

in asia i am a towering monster giantess with thunderthighs and looking at myself even at my lowest, current weight disgusts me. people stare or shrink away. or maybe they dont, but i feel like they do.

I ended up developing what i think is some sort of ed over the pandemic. last december i was at 118 lbs because i was working 8 hour shifts and then going to school and coming home just to sleep. people commented how good i looked, i felt physically better at that weight, but it wasn't sustainable and I gained back up to almost 130. I'm back down again to \~121-123

I want to recover? i dont like having this weird obsession with food and restricting and binging and purging and the whole miserable 9 yards, and it's only every few days that it really gets bad, but I try to stick to 2 meals a day and workout every day and not let myself have treats, even though i love pastries and milk and puddings...

but maybe im better off this way.

my contract in japan starts in april. will they finally look at me like a model or the ""ideal foreigner""? will i still have to be ashamed at this weight?

if i stay the weight i am maybe ill be accepted, maybe i can feel like i fit in and love myself a little more even if im being hard on my body.

I'm not underweight. so why should i even be worried? I still eat meals, i only purge every now and then, im still social and sleep ok and do normal people things, other than crying all the time and throwing up occaisonally. I'm super healthy by all measures according to my doctor. but i have such a hard relationship with food. maybe its better to stay like this so i can maybe not hate myself though.

I'm already so ashamed of my background, of my fat family, of my height, of my american-ness....im so ashamed and disgusted by my shape and embarassed when people discuss how enviable it is. All i want is to be tiny and straight-bodied and petite, but i think no matter how much weight i lose I'll never be that. maybe if i keep trying? if i hit the gym harder? if I only eat veggies?

hi everyone!! So I’ve made the decision to stop being restrictive but my fear of gaining weight is tormenting me to the point where i mentally count calories.

&lt;p&gt;hi everyone!! So I’ve made the decision to stop being restrictive but my fear of gaining weight is tormenting me to the point where i mentally count calories. Literally yesterday i had to delete Myfitnesspal for the third time this week bc it’s harming my mental health. Normally I eat about two meals and a snack but yesterday I overate and i’m trying to convince myself not to restrict today but it’s so hard bc i feel disgusting rn. i’m tired of eating the portion size of a toddler.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hey, everyone. I have been dieting from about March of this year. I've lost 20 kg( now i weigh 51kg and I am 171cm). With this, Ive lost my period for about 6 months. I've been severely restricting my calories for about 4-5 months and eating about 300-650kcal a day (healthy food but small portions) and lifting weights 3 times a week at the gym + 2 times per week cardio. But I feel like I cannot do this anymore, because of the extreme hunger that i have been feeling. all that I can think about is food: I watch lots of eating challenges, look through restaurant menus and pics of their food at my free time. I dont want to feel this way anymore. Unfortunately, I am 17 and I cannot get professional help on my ED at this moment. Tommorow I am planning on buying all of the foods that I was restricting on: chocolate bars, a pizza, donuts, cookies, ice cream and just letting myself eat however much I want for 2-4 days and then going to eating about 1000-1200kcal a day on a healthy diet ""to not get fat"" and stay generally healthy. I am scared of gaining weight, thats why I am not going ""all in"" and just planning on giving myself a break for a few days, especially because from this week the gyms are closed because of the coronavirus.I am also scared of gaining weight, because a lot of people have been commenting on my weight loss.The comments have been negative though, my friends and family say that i look too skinny, but for me it gives me a sense of pride and a feeling of control.

,EDRecovery_public,"Sorry for the long post, I've been avoiding this topic because I told myself I don't have a problem. 
I  (20F) haven't been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder but last year an acquaintance mentioned how he thought I was ""getting fat"" and that sent me into a year long spiral, I started dieting and counted my calories. I planned my meals days in advance and would refuse to eat or drink anything that ""wasn't planned"". I also insisted on working out several times a week even after I injured my leg (I pulled a ligament in my ankle and couldn't walk properly but still went to the gym). I tried to cut out sugar completely for half a year.
For a little backstory, I've always been on the smaller side, and I even became underweight as a teenager (not intentionally, my metabolism was just high) . Once I started university (and was on the pill for a year) I started putting on a bit of weight and finally looking healthier.

After stopping the pill which made me gain weight and crave sweets a lot I went down a size (now i'm a 6) but I still tried to only eat twice a day for a couple months because I was terrified that I will ""get fat in lockdown"". 
What I do have is OCD and that's probably what caused this episode, and after talking about it with my therapist I've been feeling more calm and even eat 3 proper meals a day. But some days it's harder, and I think I'm gaining weight and I'm afraid of people pointing it out 😭 my family and gf are very supportive and compliment me a lot but sometimes i have this really twisted view of myself and my brain thinks that being overweight is the end of the world, when I should be thankful I'm not underweight anymore.

,EDRecovery_public,"I’d been trapped in an ED mindset for the past 4 years. I have had highs and lows but for the past 6 months steadily, I have actively engaged in ED behaviors. I’ve lost weight and have achieved, yet again perhaps, the “perfect body” to some. But am I happy? Nope. Shocking, right?  So, I’m taking a new approach to life. 

An eating disorder robs you of your identity, ultimately. 95% of your thoughts, in some cases, may be focused and centered around numbers, tracking, restricting, pure obsessiveness, and ultimately, discontent. I feel as if I have no peace; I’m not living fully. An eating disorder takes your peace. You will never be fulfilled while engaging in ED behaviors. 

You may find yourself asking, “When will this end? When will I finally be happy with myself?” The answer is not to be found in your physical appearance or numbers. You are so much more than a body; you are a soul. In fact, you are your soul. Your body will deteriorate; your soul will not. 

Take a moment to think about your crush. Do you have a crush on them merely for their body? Think about it. If you answer yes to this question, then you have got some thinking to do. Most of us would answer a big NO! We’re attracted to true beauty. Perhaps the essence of beauty is compassion, gentleness, strength, and selflessness. 
Can we truly be any of these things, these virtues most people desire to possess, if we are constantly fixated on our eating disorders(aka, ourselves)? 
The simple answer is no.

True happiness results from dying to ourselves and finding purpose in living for others. We cannot be this wonderful human we, ourselves, dream of meeting someday if we choose to focus on our EDs, folks! 

You are more than a number. You are more than a body. Your beauty is not skin-deep. You deserve to live a free, beautiful life. Now, read that again. You, yes, YOU deserve a life ED-free. Please, choose it so you can be entirely authentically yourself. Choose recovery so you can have a personality again. Choose recovery so you slowly learn that food is nothing to be scared of; it’s a true gift that brings people who care for each other together. Choose recovery so you can share a dinner in town with your date and not panic over the thought of it. Choose it so you can eat anything and not feel immense, debilitating guilt after doing so. 

 Having been on both sides of the spectrum, recovery always wins. So much more joy is to be found in letting go of your ED and being truly free. There’s SO much more to life than being stuck in your mind. I decided to choose LIFE and you need to too. 

I pray you choose life today. Choose recovery. Choose YOU! 

Although it may be terrifying, I assure you it’s so worth it. You are not only worthy, but deserving of the most incredible life you could’ve ever dreamed of living. If you’re not living it now, what’s stopping you from trying a new approach to it? What have you got to lose? The truth is you have nothing to lose, but possibly everything to gain.

&lt;p&gt;He thinks I&amp;#39;m diving into business that&amp;#39;s not mine to care about, I think it&amp;#39;s not cool for a 23 year old man to eat so damn little (especially when he has someone with an ed around him all day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone out there have any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

Recently though I started having weird symptoms, hair and eyebrows loss, dermatitis, headache, constipation, difficulty swallowing, no energy and terrible short term memory, depression (I thought it was hypothyroidism but my tsh was only 4,18).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever experience something like that? How did you recover? (I’m a kinda normal BMI now)&lt;/p&gt;

,EDRecovery_public,"Hi everyone!
I suffered from anorexia (never got to an extra low weight but I was ""severely underweight"" according to bmi charts) and I lost my period pretty soon (I lost 20 kg, and I lost my period at around -6kg).
Without support from my family (my mom is just now realizing that I was truly mentally ill even tho I never looked like a walking skeleton thanks to good genetics) I had to recover by myself. I ate a good amount of food, around 2000-3000 kcals, but I kept working out (with few weeks-long hiatuses) and I never let myself go out of control (aka I never binged/listened to extreme hunger). I then slowly got better and now I can say I'm almost recovered: I don't count calories, I eat whatever I want, I workout when and as much as I fancy, my weight is healthy and so Is my body fat mass... I only have two things holding me back: I weight myself several times a day (3-5 times), and my period never came back.
The weight on the scale doesn't affect my eating, I still listen to my body, but it can ruin my mood.
And the period... Well, I learnt that the only weight to get it back naturally is by eating enough food/nutrients. Unfortunately, I eat very little (I've never been someone who eats a lot) and I'm rarely hungry (I'm talking 1400-1800 kcals a day max, more or less). What should I do? Has someone experienced something similar?

,EDRecovery_public,"Mom tries to make me feel better by insulting me

I have binge eating disorder and was seeing a therapist for it during most of 2019. I’ve gotten much better and don’t binge anymore. I do still suffer with other symptoms of my eating disorder such as low self esteem, restrictive eating, depression, and anxiety. As well as some childhood trauma that my mother is very much aware of. 

I was making so much progress while going to therapy and after I was finished with it. I was down almost thirty pounds, and on my way to a healthy relationship with food. With the quarantine my healthy eating habits got put on the back burner. I’ve been eating the old processed crap I used to eat all day everyday. Now I just eat that crap at my normal scheduled times that me and my therapist came up with. When I was doing what I needed to I was buying my own groceries and not eating out. Now that I’m not working as much anymore I rely on what my parents buy for food. There isn’t a fresh vegetable in the house anymore. 

That brings us to yesterday. I had checked my weight on the scale. Since my last therapy appointment in January I gained nine pounds. Maybe I was overreacting, but I cried and felt like a failure. I went to my mom which was the biggest mistake. 

She told me basically not to be sad because “You are in shape! Round is a shape!” She loves that stupid joke so much... She said that to try and make me feel better.

,EDRecovery_public,"Hey, recently I have started to experience extreme hunger, especially in the afternoon/evening. I feel like im binging and I feel disgusted of myself. I also experience extreme bloating and its like I feel hungry even when my stomach hurts so bad and is extremely bloated. I have had anorexia for about 2 years and now I am mentally able to eat a lot of foods even junk. My lowest weight was about 44-45 kg then I maintained 47 for about a year and now Im 50 and scared as fuck. I feel like a fat pig and like I will develop binge eating disorder.( my height is 168cm) I gained the weight the past 1-2 months and  what scares me the most is that I cant control myself and eat like a normal human.

some history: i have a long history with trauma and self destructive behavior including selfharm, anorexia and bulimia. ive never really stopped having a bad relationship with food and restrictions, but this year ive really tried to eat like a normal person but its driving me fucking mad because im the heaviest ive ever been eating three meals a day. im 5’3 ish and 154? lbs. idk because the weight scale we have rn is broken. its the highest number ive ever seen for me. and i notice the difference, new thickness, discomfort in previously comfortable positions, my clothes feeling so much tighter. my happiest weigh thats healthy for my body type seems to be 130-135 and i was eating two solid meals and feeling satisfied 

im trying to find the courage to exercise, because unlike a lot of people it seems? i have always been so terrified of exercising. i dont like how it makes me even hungrier than i already am, so i would just starve for so long at a time sometimes for 3 days id eat like 1-2 snacks, see how many hours i could go without it and try to beat that number. i would live normal days or do nothing and watch myself lose 5lbs in a week and feel good about it. but the binges have always been terrible and id lose and gain so rapidly all the time for years of my life. ive been in therapy for 7 years but have rarely discussed this because im ashamed of admitting that i feel ugly and fat. idk why this is the one thing i feel like i cant tell the truth about to fucking anyone despite talking about the most horrible things ive been thru with a lot less stress. perhaps because i feel like the abuse i endured from other people i know is not my fault, but that my views on myself and how i treat myself is mostly on me. but it loops in my head because i know trauma really impacts all of my behavior and psychical conditions. so i just dunno. 

but to reiterate- i feel like i eat so goddamn much but i feel so hungry all the time. i eat sometimes 4 times a day now or more on the weekends. the weirdest thing for me- the “hungry” is not the hungry i know. its like, my body is craving the food so fucking bad- but like my stomach doesnt. i over eat every time. its driving me crazy. i try to eat healthier things tho- lots of veggies and fruits, but im vegetarian and i eat a lot of carbs and sometimes i go crazy on sugar. its just so much!!!! i cant seem to do anything between over eating and under eating and im losing my mind. does anyone have a way to break the cravings??? im an artist and i work at home right next to the kitchen and i fucking hate how its RIGHT THERE ALL DAY. im sure it has a lot to do with not leaving the house and being next to food all day long, im all alone, and since im thinking about starving i tell myself to do the opposite. im almost 7 months selfharm free and i know that is really not helping. i always have disturbed sleep so my energy is always fucked. i dont have health insurance or a doctor, i get government therapy and  a psych but i dont take any meds. 

does anyone know how to help me limit myself with eating constantly?? ive tried meal plans but i just dont feel satisfied after i eat so i spend all the time im not eating thinking about how good food sounds even when im not actually hungry. i dont feel the pit of my stomach u kno what i mean??? idk im just so lost and i dont know who else to ask aside from people who have recovered and maybe experienced something like this. thank u to anyone who reads and thank u for this sub. 💞",,False,,0,False,im so hungry all the time but i feel like i eat so much,[],r/EDRecovery_public,False,0,,0,,False,t3_f9jpvp,False,dark,0.83,,restricted,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,,False,,,{},,True,,1582674292.0,text,0,,,,self.EDRecovery_public,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;potentially triggering so please take care: this is a post asking for tips and advice as i try to recover and lose weight at the same time. i dont want to fall back into my starve binge repeat habit, but im hating how my current meal/appetite is acting. &lt;/p&gt;

,EDRecovery_public,"Hello all. 
I am not a very seasoned redditor, and I am new to this group today so I'm not sure if this is the place for me or not yet. 
I am 28. I have been considered ""recovered"" from my bulimia by most of my friends and family for about 6 years now. What they do not realize is that, just because I managed to pull my face out of the toilet ( most days)  does not mean that still don't struggle with disordered thoughts and body dysmorphia every second of every day. 
At my worst I was purging around 2-5 times a day on average. Sometimes it was a full blown binge, others just after a snack I didn't think I deserved. I had horrible acid reflux, tooth decay, and scars on my knuckles. Now I would say I purge only about once a month, and only in a moment of weakness after overeating. I never intentionally binge and purge anymore. 

That being said, I have lost a lot of the support I once had from those close to me. Not like it's a choice they have made, just that it's not as in their face anymore so they don't think about it as much. While I have come a really long way, and I am very proud of the progress I have made, I still have a long way to go before I can honestly say that I'm comfortable in this body. 

I feel like this part of the recovery doesn't really get talked about. The part when if feels like everyone but you has forgotten that you were on death's door not that long ago. My question is how do you continue to push? What are some things I can do to improve my mental state? 

I have put on some weight in the last few years and I am very uncomfortable with my body right now. It's been so bad lately that I dont even want to be naked to shower, let alone be seen or touched by my husband. I worry that this will hurt my marriage unless I get myself together, because I am constantly turning him down. (What is that doing to HIS self esteem?)

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

My bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. Last Thursday I finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad andyesterday I broke down and asked for help even though I've been eating lunch thanks to my bf help and he explained it to my mum...

,EDRecovery_public,"[tw: drug mention and ed stuff, as implied in title]







I've been recovering for the past 2 years or so but  have found the disordered mindset quite difficult to shake off.
Discomfort over my weigh gain and fantasizing about being thin again took up a lot of headspace and I never felt recovered mentally. 

Although not a solution in themselves, I've found that using shrooms has helped me look at my disordered thoughts more objectively and since tripping i've been able to ignore them more easily. I think that they showed me that I didn't need to remain stuck in this mindset and that it was a thought loop that actually could be broken out of.
In some ways, it feels like they've reset my self-image and allowed me to re-evaluate my sense of self-worth and create goals that aren't focused around trying to manipulate my body  in a destructive way.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been recovering for the past 2 years or so but  have found the disordered mindset quite difficult to shake off.
Discomfort over my weigh gain and fantasizing about being thin again took up a lot of headspace and I never felt recovered mentally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not a solution in themselves, I&amp;#39;ve found that using shrooms has helped me look at my disordered thoughts more objectively and since tripping i&amp;#39;ve been able to ignore them more easily. I think that they showed me that I didn&amp;#39;t need to remain stuck in this mindset and that it was a thought loop that actually could be broken out of.
In some ways, it feels like they&amp;#39;ve reset my self-image and allowed me to re-evaluate my sense of self-worth and create goals that aren&amp;#39;t focused around trying to manipulate my body  in a destructive way.

,EDRecovery_public,"There was a post on [r/AskWomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen) about having a healthy relationship with food. Seeing so many people struggling there, I felt compelled to write up what I have learned from seeing a dietician.  I just realized it may be helpful here also!

* Eat at least 15g of protein within an hour of waking up. Whether or not I do this is the biggest indicator of my mood, hunger cues, and eating habits the rest of the day. Please try it. It has changed my life. (amount is based on BMI)
* The plate model for lunch and dinner: 1/2 plate = vegetables, 1/4 plate = carbs, 1/4 plate = lean protein (fish, chicken, beans, nuts, seitan, tempeh, tofu, wheat gluten, etc.)
* Meal planning: plan out your meals for the entire week on one day (gets easier/quicker after a few weeks) and write a shopping list for only what you need. Shop one day a week (max two if you forget somethings) and stick to your list. Helps keep your grocery budget low and eliminates impulse purchases.
* **Your relationship with food and your body is the longest relationship you have. It is an ongoing process. That is okay.**
* Eat a snack in between lunch and dinner that contains a lean protein and a carb. (7\-10g protein)
* Beans = protein and carbs; nuts = protein and fats.
* FAT! You need healthy fats in your diet for important biological processes. (Nuts, fish, avocados, olive oil, dark chocolate, coconut/coconut oil, small servings of cheese, etc.) If you are faced with the option of high fat, low sugar VS low fat, high sugar \- choose the first one.
* Try for consistent meal times each day, including weekends. (roughly the same time \- this one is SO hard)

Eating balanced meals, eating a good amount, and eating consistently throughout the day helps way more than just how your body feels. It helps your mind, your mental health, and mood. I cannot say I have achieved perfection or anything close to it, but these steps have really helped me a lot.

EDIT: Please do not give yourself more food rules because of this post! I wish I had put a trigger warning and now I feel terrible.  These ideas are not right for everyone and not right for every stage of recovery!

,EDRecovery_public,"I'm a 19 year old female.  This is my first post on here, but I've lurked for a few months. I've suffered from anorexia for about 2 years now.  Recently, I finally decided that enough was enough.
I've been underweight for approximately a year, and severely underweight for about 6 months.  For the past month and a half, I have upped my calorie intake greatly.  Before, I was quite restrictive and I've been told I was close to collapse.

My question is... is the extreme constipation and gas I experience on a daily basis normal?
 At the risk of giving too much information, it's not uncommon for me to have a bowel movement every 3 days despite feeling painfully bloated and knowing that I'm putting a LOT of food in my body. The gas....well it's unlike anything I've ever smelled. It literally smells like I've shit myself, and it occurs 10+ times a day.
This makes it really hard to continue eating when I feel so full, and as if my body cant process the food fast enough.
Is this normal? Will it go away? When? Any replies would be so appreciated as this is a huge setback for me, and quite frankly it's making my life HELLA awkward. By the way, this thread is amazing and has been the inspiration for me to start this journey. Stay strong beautiful people.

,EDRecovery_public,"Gently ease into the holiday season by focusing on activities that don't involve food, such as putting up decorations, or sending e-cards.


Check in with your body before and while you are eating¡ Am I feeling hungry? Am I feeling full?


Remember that all food is neutral - there are no good or bad foods.


If it makes you feel better, organize your own food to take to a function or a meal, and let the host know that you will be doing this, in advance.


Stay away from any kind of good food/bad food/diet thinking or conversation.


If things don't go as planned, remember that one meal will not make a significant difference to your body.


If you are hosting a meal, allow people to bring food that they feel OK eating, if they wish to.


Try to shift the focus away from food and counting calories, to celebrating, and spending time with loved ones.


Work out your own support system in advance - identify close friends and/or family members that you can reach out to for support, if and when you need it. Or ask a friend if you can text her/him to check in, if you feel you need to.


Plan some alternative activities that you can do when you are feeling stressed or over-whelmed, e.g. taking the dog out for a walk, take a drive somewhere or call a friend.


Take care of yourself - if this means not going to a function, (or going to a function), then do what feels right for you at the time.


Surround yourself with people who have healthy relationships with their bodies, and who do not focus on food and weight. Or when attending gatherings, bring a trusted family member or friend along with you, if you can.

,EDRecovery_public,"In the social circles that I travel (anarchism, feminism, punk, other identity/political groups) there is the common belief that followers of these subcultures are immune to eating disorders. That because these folks are outside of society and are fully capable of seeing through societal/advertising lies these subcultures are free from some of the pressures and root causes. However, I know feminists in recovery from an eating disorder (and the feminism/queer politics person as the case may be was ""in the know"" prior to recovery) so this is clearly a lie.

While eating disorders are intensely private and personal in their root causes, it seems to be in vogue to blame the media. These folks prove that if the media is taken out of the equation there can still be eating disorders. Is it just me that's noticing this?
