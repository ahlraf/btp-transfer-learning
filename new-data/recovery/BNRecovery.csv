,BulimiaRecovery,"There may have been a post like this in the past, but I can’t seem to find it. I’m trying to make a list of reasons to recover ~ physical, mental, emotional ~ and would love more ideas of what your top reasons to recover are. Mine are:

1) Be able to be closer and spend more genuine time with friends and people I love - bulimia isolates and separates me from people I love with the shame and secrecy. I can be hanging out with someone and my mind will be fixated on food and B/P after I see them, or will cancel plans altogether.  

2) See and like what my face actually looks like without swollen glands / cheeks from purging. My face being puffy and swollen is a huge trigger to me, yet I know in order to get it to go down, I need to not purge. 

3) Get rid of the shakiness, dizziness, heart palpitations, and brain fog caused by bulimia.

Hi Everyone,

By way of introduction - I'm a fourth-year Honours/ psychology student in Australia, with a personal interest in studying Eating Disorders due to how it has affected my life personally (and continues to affect it).

As part of my university degree, we are currently conducting a study to investigate how one’s self-perception relates to Eating Disorder symptoms, as well as other psychological symptoms including emotion regulation, Obsessive Compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphia symptoms, and depression.

To be eligible, you must be aged 18 years or older and fluent in English. **You do NOT** need to have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or an Eating Disorder to participate.

If you are eligible and wish to complete our approximately 20-minute survey, please click the link below, PM me or email the supervisor [richard.moulding@cairnmillar.edu.au](mailto:richard.moulding@cairnmillar.edu.au) if you would like more information:

Lately, I've been connecting the dots about more of the ways bulimia damaged my body, and it's been really hard not to spiral and be upset with myself. It's hard to know my teeth are so sensitive and cavity prone now and realize bulimia can't have helped with my thinning enamel, for example. But a few weeks ago, I learned that bulimia can weaken your pelvic floor muscles, and a lot of things made sense in ways that... I'm still upset and frustrated over. There's smaller things, like occasionally peeing a bit if I sneeze or something. There's also the fact that I tend to pee during sex. Embarrassing, but true.

I don't want to feel embarrassed or ashamed or blame myself. I intend to look into things like kegel exercises to re strengthen my pelvic floor muscles and see if things get better. If not, well.

,BulimiaRecovery,"Hello everyone.

It has been a while since I made a post in this subreddit, and recovery for my gf (17) has been going great! It has been almost 4 months without a B/P and she has been doing very well. However, this past week, for whatever reason, her p\*rging urges have come back. One night, I dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p\*rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. Shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p\*rge. The good part is that I was with her, so I literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. This is the moment where I realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery.

Tonight was no different than the other experiences shared. We ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to McDonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the McDonalds bathroom (without telling me or anyone else) and started attempting to forcing a purge. If I hadn't have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p\*rged.

I have told her many times that this is a problem that I want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she B/P (especially that night where I had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half), and she knows that too.

Is there any recommendations that you guys have for recovery? It seems like she doesn't actually believe that it's a problem because its the 'first time in a while' but I know how relapses work and I know it will go right back to where we started if a relapse happens. She used to text me and ask for help and I would drop everything I was doing (often even texting her while driving home, or dropping everything I'm doing to go to her house and spend time with her) which seemed to help her a lot in her initial recovery journey. However, I feel like my effect on her and her ED has been cut down significantly to the point where she doesn't even listen to me anymore and I'm starting to feel like I'm not enough.

She has expressed that she does not want therapy, but would be okay with it if it means that she recovers (this happened in a conversation BEFORE the one we had today where she said that it is 'okay' to do what shes doing). Maybe even like a bulimia support group where she can talk to other people in a similar situation to her? Please help us with whatever you can- she can read this post too!

,BulimiaRecovery,"I’ve been on and off bulimic since I was 15, it got really bad when I entered into university. I’m very secretive and ashamed about my eating disorder, I became a recluse and missed out on so many social events and formative experiences because of my ED :(. I’ve never really been able to talk about it with anyone. Often I would overeat and purge multiple times a day.

Since covid first hit, I moved back in with my parents and took university online for 2 years. Because I’m so secretive with my eating disorder (not wanting anyone to know about my purging) and food was out of my control living at home again, I have been completely recovered for the past 2 years. Quarantine allowed me to eat only when I was hungry and regain a lot of control around food in general. Because I only had access to the heathy food at home, I was not really inclined to binge. I naturally ended up loosing some weight as well, which made me feel neutral about my body which I don’t think I’ve been able to feel for such a long time. I was also lightly working out for the first time in years. I did have a point where I think I was at risk for developing anorexia as I got a bit addicted to going long periods of time without eating but this didn’t stick luckily.

A few months ago I moved to a different country for work, changing my lifestyle dramatically. My work is very busy and I have no regularity with when I eat or what I eat, causing a great amount of distress considering the control I had before. I’m staying with family friends and they all are overeaters and often encourage me to eat massive portions. I’m in Asia, so food is put out family style, meaning that instead of a controlled portion, you can just keep eating and eating. I’m completely on the verge of a relapse of bulimia (I feel like my brain is already relapsed into the ED way of thinking).

My stomach shrank a lot during my recovery: I was mostly grazing throughout the day on heathy food rather than having full meals which was really good because I’m triggered both by feeling hungry and feeling full. But because of my past with bulimia, even if I’m not hungry I am capable of eating huge amounts of food. Right now I feel so out of control. I’ve already gained weight and I cannot stop thinking about food or my body or dieting 24/7. I did have a lapse where I purged after eating two sandwiches for breakfast about a month ago but I’m so scared about further damaging my teeth (thank you for this subreddit, reading about health issues really has helped me stay purge free). I don’t even enjoy food in the same way anymore; when I
bindged before I used to get like a high from food, now it seems I just overeat and binge because it’s there.

Because I’m in another country and my busy schedule, I mostly eat alone which is super triggering because I have no idea what amount of food is normal and I’m always overthinking it. I also receive a large amount of food as gifts through work - I’ve resorted to throwing it away because if I take it home I know I will binge on it.

Basically I want to know if anyone has any advice for me to curb ED brain before I relapse. I’m already feeling isolated, depressed, anxious and lonely and part of me wants to relapse to just regain some sense of that control back.

,BulimiaRecovery," I used reddit once in my lifetime and it was the key point for me to try and overcome bulimia. This communities saved my life, basically. I was facing a dilemma: either I live or bulimia does it for me. After attempts and attempts, new strategies, everything possible, I decided to ask for help. If it wasn't for a post made here, I wouldn't be able to write this one.
For you,m suffering from this disease, what I can tell is: yes, it sucks. It sucks getting through it, sometimes it'll look like you're making no improvement at all. That shit keeps following us, even after years without a crisis, any stomach pain you feel -- and I've been having one --, the first thing you think is: ""well, this is bulimia's consequence, again"". If not for pain, be it for a doctor treating you like you were a pet or a kid: ""oh, so you had bulimia?"" and any symptoms you describe will be related to it. Sometimes people won't listen. ""I'm trying"", ""I won this fight"", ""I'm in control now"", all of it, for a lot of people, will always sound like you're just at the same place. But why would you keep on trying so?
I've been through hell and back because of this shit. Bulimia was my life for eight years: from eleven to almost twenty. I couldn't make a move without thinking about purging and binding. It didn't matter where and how. Sometimes I forced vomit and kept swallowing my own vomit until I found a place where I could actually let it go. It could take one hour, two or even four, I didn't care at all. But when you don't feel like you want to purge anymore, don't force yourself to vomit, when you actually can enjoy a meal with your family or your friendships feel much better and honest, then you feel it worths. 
Ok, you won't just live your life like it never happened. Sometimes you'll feel like you maybe eating too much, you won't trust yourself or feel confident to eat something... those things, I mean, they do happen. But it's a part of it. Does it suck? Yes, a lot. You're through the worst. It's normal, it takes a while, it's a big, enormous fight, but we are making it, everyday, step by step.

I felt I should write this small -- and bad written text--, cuz I had a bad experience with a doctor for a thyroid problem I'm having and... well, since last wendnesday (five days ago, for those who read this after a while), I've been feeling a big stomach pain. Sometimes I bloat, suddenly, for a while now. I'm afraid I have been developing a disease or complication in my digestive system due to bulimia through my whole growing up process. Yesterday Iaied down, look at the ceiling and asked myself: ""am I facing a shadow of that again?"" Feels like I can't take another ride. I'm almost 22 now. I purged since my elevens, stopped as soon as pandemics started -- it was fast, I know. Then, I remembered something: dude, I fought a huge battle, alone. This one, at least -- if it's a battle to come only time will tell --, at the very least, this one, I know I can win. 
All of you here are warriors. Even if you purged, even if after day, months or years it happened again, we are all here, trying, by our own -- some of us have people on their backs, supporting 'em, off course, but we are doing it, aren't we? So, I mean, even though this whole shit gets tiring at some point, we -- and I mean as community, family, friends and individual -- we will thrive!

,BulimiaRecovery,"Hi all—I’m posting here mostly because I can’t afford therapy at this moment and I’m really needing some advice on how I can stop myself from fully going over the edge into serious bulimia. I’ve had issues with restrictive eating pointed out to me by a therapist before, but I didn’t think it was a problem until my boyfriend told me last night that he was starting to be concerned about my relationship with food. I often don’t eat anything all day other than a few cups of coffee, yoghurt or a banana and then binge junk food late at night because I’m so hungry and then I feel awful about myself. I started purging semi regularly to relieve some of the discomfort from my binges, but it’s started becoming more frequent. I’d always thought as the purging as “oh I feel nauseous, so I’ll make myself vomit to feel better” but, when I admitted that to my boyfriend, he got even more concerned and said it may be bulimia. I’m honestly really frightened. I’ve always had a horrible relationship with food and my body (I’m the biggest I’ve ever been right now—I’m a size 6–and I’m hating how I look), and on more than one occasion I’ve complimented someone on their looks and asked how they got to be so skinny, and they’ve replied with “I have an eating disorder.” I’ve never thought I’d be in that territory…but I think I am and I’m terrified.

,BulimiaRecovery,"Hey.

I've had bulimia for 8 months, purging daily if not many times a day most of the time.
I finally decided this can't go on any longer at the start of this month. 
I was binge/purge free for a week and felt great. I got so much done, started exercising ate healthy and enough (1600-1800 calories). Then I b/p:d for 3 days in a row and abstained from purging for the next 3 days, then had one b/p day, then 2 days without and now today I b/p:d again.
Of course I'm glad that I've only b/p:d 8 days in the past 21 days when before I would've b/p:d 19-21 days. For me this is pretty huge, even if it doesn't seem like it.
But I can't help but feel discouraged that I b/p:d today and broke my ""sober"" cycle.

,BulimiaRecovery,"I love my gf a lot. Recently she has opened up about her bulimic struggles and  I have been more than willing to help her in any way she needs. For example, I'm making sure she doesn't p\*rge by only taking her to food options that she will ""approve of?"" I'm helping her when she is about to p\*rge and im trying to talk her out of it. With my help, she has gone from b/p almost daily, to being b/p free for almost two months. Until today.

Today was our anniversary and she recently caught covid (we both live with our parents), so I haven't seen her in a few days. I decided it would be a great idea to visit her with some gifts, and since she loves bubble tea, I ordered a size medium of her favourite drink. Around 4 hours ago, I surprised her at her house with the gifts and everything was going great. As I was on my way home, she texted me saying how she feels the need to p\*rge after drinking the bubble tea (i did not provide any other food in the gift, and I only added it to the gift because she said that anytime I gave her a drink she would promise not to p\*rge, not sure how, but she said it). I have delivered bubble tea I believe twice in this time frame where she has gone without b/p, and everything has gone great. Until today.

That text worried me. I love her so much to the point where whenever she is in pain, I also feel the pain, sometimes even worse. I finally get home, and I'm frantically texting her, and trying my best to make her not p\*rge the drink that I bought for her, knowing that it will be my fault (I helped her in similar ways when it wasn't my fault as well, just needed to add that).  After texting and FaceTiming for over an hour, I finally just gave up because I could not handle the constant interruptions of me talking with gagging/coughing. I tried my best. I really did. I was telling her everything that I could think of, I was doing research mid conversation to see what else I could say to possibly change her mind, but it obviously was not good enough. I feel terrible, my mood is ruined, and I am definitely going to get no sleep for the next few nights.

She insists that it was not my fault, and that it depends on her mood. She also said that it's her fault because she could have just stopped drinking it when she knew that it was going to make her sick, but she continued. She said that its ok because she barely p\*rged anything. Everything she says just stems back to me actually giving her the drink, which obviously makes it my fault. I can't physically help her, and I really want her to get better, but I just don't know what to do next.

I want the best for her, I really do. I just don't know if I am enough to help her. I'm afraid she needs someone else who can help her more.

But ever since I was 14 (I'm 22 now) I've had an awful relationship with food and my self image/weight. 
I was fat as a child and was bullied in middle school to early high school to the point where I stopped eating and lost 60 lbs and became obsessed with looking very attractive all throughout HS. I joined track and field, and would often eat very low calorie meals/skip and terrified of eating carbs. I was 6'1 male and 155 lbs at my lowest in HS before gaining muscle doing track. I'd often experience temporary vision loss when really starving myself and doing track workouts.

Now 5 years later overtime after college and a getting a job, I gained 120 lbs (275 lbs). I was actually moderately at peace with it for a while and found inner confidence and my landed a good job that made me happy. That confidence crashed and burned because I started really liking a girl to basically falling in love with that eventually rejected me, which was just so rare for me when I was a 100 lbs lighter, an athlete in HS and was often seen as very attractive. 

But all those years in HS of me starving I literally bullied myself to not eat even a slice of bread or I'll heavily fat shame myself and call me worthless. That whole mindset slowly had come back to me and now it's so much worse. 

I lost 40 lbs since Nov by starving myself for 4+ days to then binge and purge. It's come to the point where every single day I'm not fasting I'm ordering whole pizzas or large calorie meals and eating it all to then just force myself to puke everything out. I'm force puking out every meal and terrified of gaining a single pound each morning. If I'm not eating that day I'd force myself to not eat for 4-5 days. Then I'd end the fast and just binge so much and heavily that I'd eventually gain the lost weight back, to then absolutely terrify over it. Then, fast for another 4 days, repeat the whole thing. Since the past 4 weeks I had gained 10 lbs, lost 10 lbs, gained it back, and just now lost it back only because i broke my fast because i was tired. I cooked a patty and then barfed it out.

,BulimiaRecovery,"TW: ED, Sexual Assault, and Self-Harm

Just wanted to share some of my experiences with Dr. Sarah Selden - truly the worst clinician I have encountered over my time in New York City. She is a private practice therapist in NYC and works with the Greenwich Mental Health Group in Connecticut.

What started out as a maybe not ideal, therapy relationship went completely downhill after 2 years. Though she was not very good at her job, she didn't begin to display an abusive pattern until after I returned from studying abroad with my university.

Dr. Selden repeatedly failed to do her job - instead of teaching me communication skills, she labeled all the people around me as narcissists (ironic in the least) and created a completely false world around me, sat by as my eating disorder got worse and worse, laughed in my face when I told her I was sexually assaulted and when I showed her that I had self=harmed worse than I ever had.

The so-called ""Dr."" Selden failed to repeatedly reach out when her job was too difficult for her and eventually broke confidentiality by calling my parents and had me hospitalized when I was not displaying any suicidal urges. The timing of this hospitalization was solely to keep me from attending school, which had started that week.

Dr. Selden then called the only psychiatrist in my hometown and informed her that I was 'too difficult of a patient to deal with', leading that psychiatrist break with me and to suggest care 100 miles away. This was after a suicide attempt brought on by the abuse perpetrated by Dr. Selden.

Dr. Selden failed on numerous occasions to display basic empathy for her patient. She also wasted my insurance, spending sessions rambling about my visit abroad, even years later.

I spent 4 years under Dr. Selden's care and regret every moment of it. I wish I had left earlier.

Please do not subject yourself to what I went through.

,BulimiaRecovery," I am not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I need help and figured you guys would know the most.

Before this relationship, I had no idea what bulimia was. Eventually my gf opened up to me and told me what it was, how it affects her, how long she has been struggling with this, etc. I want to help her recover.

She has been suffering from binge eating/purging for a year or two, but she is getting better. She used to B/P roughly 3-4 times a week, but now it is becoming once every other week, or so. I have found that she cares a lot about her own body image, which I assumed because of sticky notes describing her ""ideal body weight"" on a wall in her room, as well as a drawing of her ideal body, etc. I have done quite a bit of research on this, and have tried my best to help, but since I can't be with her 24 hours a day, how else can I help?

She has told me how she sets 'calorie limits' in her head, and if she goes over them during the day, she decides to purge. When I am with her (which is a few times a week) I ensure that she is not going over her calorie limit, so that she does not have to purge. Is this the right solution? Should I be promoting the limits, or should I try to get her to eat whatever she wants and make her not purge? She is not open to therapy/medication, since some of her close friends have had major side effects towards the medication, and she does not want to discuss with a therapist. She weighed herself for the first time in a few months, and based on how she reacted to the results, I am worried that this will make her situation worse.

Sorry if this sounds stupid, I do not personally struggle with this so I have not encountered these experiences before.

I have found that she cares a lot about her own body image, which I assumed because of sticky notes describing her &amp;quot;ideal body weight&amp;quot; on a wall in her room, as well as a drawing of her ideal body, etc. I have done quite a bit of research on this, and have tried my best to help, but since I can&amp;#39;t be with her 24 hours a day, how else can I help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has told me how she sets &amp;#39;calorie limits&amp;#39; in her head, and if she goes over them during the day, she decides to purge. When I am with her (which is a few times a week) I ensure that she is not going over her calorie limit, so that she does not have to purge. Is this the right solution? Should I be promoting the limits, or should I try to get her to eat whatever she wants and make her not purge? She is not open to therapy/medication, since some of her close friends have had major side effects towards the medication, and she does not want to discuss with a therapist. She weighed herself for the first time in a few months, and based on how she reacted to the results, I am worried that this will make her situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this sounds stupid, I do not personally struggle with this so I have not encountered these experiences before. Please let me know, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

,BulimiaRecovery,"Hi everyone I am here  bc I need to make a really quick statement just because I need to get some thing out of my conscience. 

I have been trying to recover for a few years now, may be about three. And although I have moments where I fall back into the state of the illness, there are moments when I am totally confident and ready to fight for what’s right for my body. 
Nevertheless, for over a year now, I have these odd situations. Although I am allowing my body to eat and I am confident in doing so, as soon as I feel the slightest discomfort from eating (nausea often happens), I’ll go p***ing. And afterwards it feels like what made me feel sick is gone and therefore I am feeling better. 

But I am worried now since this « ritual » is happening more and more. I start to be worried because I’ve heard of all the possibilities of stomach or oesophagus cancer for people who used to have EDs. 
I’ve talked about it to my therapist but since I also told her about my sleeping issues she said that this ritual wasn’t necessarily a priority that it just meant I was in a stressed state of mine. 

I’d like a wider veux from anyone here because I don’t know what’s going on. Feels like something isn’t right…

So now, I feel kinda hopeless. I know that it’s on me to recover and this setback shouldn’t matter. But the stress I am feeling from school isn’t helping with thinking clearly.

,BulimiaRecovery,"Hello, I'm currently in recovery for a 15+ year long battle with bulimia.

I have this one pair of baggy comfy jeans that were loose around my waist in May, and now I can barely breath in them.

Big life changes have happened this summer, I’ve moved to another country, started a new job and made lots of new friends. In Spain, food is an important part of daily life and the culture. People eat five times a day, four at least and there’s special names and meal times for each of these five meals. At first it was overwhelming and definitely knocked my relationship with food. I feel like I’ve been binging since I got here and now I don’t know what to do.

I want to loose this weight, I want my baggy jeans to be baggy again and I want people to stop commenting on what I eat. This is something that has always made me feel incredibly anxious and as food is so important here I find it’s happening more frequently. ‘Eat more, don’t eat this, don’t eat that, you should try this, stop eating bread..’ I know these comments shouldn’t affect me but they do, they make my heart thump and I panic.

My self esteem shouldn’t be tied to my weight gain but it is. I feel like shit, like a stupid piece of shit who shouldn’t have become so relaxed because look what’s happened. I could easily drop 10kg and still have a healthy BMI. My body fat percentage has never been higher. I hate myself for it.

It’s like I have the two little people of either shoulder, the devil on the left telling me to VOMIT VOMIT VOMIT and the insta fairy on the right whimpering shit like ✨your body doesn’t determine your worth✨love urself✨. I’m pissed off.
