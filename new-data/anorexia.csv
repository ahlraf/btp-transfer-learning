,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi everyone! So, it has been suggested in the far past that we add a Discord server for the subreddit. We decided that now is a good time to add one, and so we have been working on and are finishing up one right now!   


While it is an official server for the subreddit, those that are not a part of the subreddit are welcome there as well. It is not strictly for the subreddit. It's more like it's affiliated with it. In saying that, please feel free to invite others from outside of the subreddit if you feel they'd thrive in a supportive environment on Discord.   


The rules of the server are similar to the rules of the subreddit, so make sure you at least familiarize yourself with them upon joining to make sure you don't accidentally break any. We hope this server becomes an active, fun, supportive safe-space fore members of the subreddit and others to talk with each other. If you don't have a Discord account, it's free to use and free to join the server.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi everyone! We actually updated it about a week or two ago, but I forgot to make an announcement sharing the update. 

As some of you may recall, we made a post a bit ago with a poll asking you guys if you thought we should add the prohibition of specific fasting times to rule ten. For a reminder, rule ten is the rule in which numbers unrelated to time are prohibited; the numbers related to weights, calories, etc.  [This is the post I'm referring to.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/siermg/as_an_addition_to_rule_10_disallow_fasting_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) 

The poll passed, and results came in, and they said that we should add that fasting times be no longer allowed. So here we are with that added to the rules for everyone to see, as a note to rule ten.

With the mod stuff out of the way... guys, I was going through my old posts, and I've been a mod here for three damn years. And when I first got added by the admins (the original sub creator was hella inactive), there were only around four thousand of us. Now there are *thirty-three thousand.* It's only been about three years since January. 

How long have you guys been here for? Has anyone else been here for as long as I have? I... probably won't recognize any of your names, honestly. I suck with Reddit usernames and until the last three months or so, I never looked at them, even. Would be interesting to see how far back y'all have been active here for, though!

My dad really cares for me and I know he doesn’t mean to do it and that he’s still working on himself, but Im still extremely insecure about myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, It was to the point where I would just not eat and sometimes I would faint, and I almost cracked my skull open because I fainted fell on the floor head first (which hurt for like a few mins but I’m very grateful to not have needed to have gone to the hospital). I feel like I’m relapsing. Sometimes I feel extremely insecure and I’m absolutely terrified of ever reaching 120 pounds (I’m 5’5) and about 110 right now. I have no idea on what to do, any advice? (The relapse of anorexia right now isn’t as bad as last year, but I still have terrible Body image)&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I’m physically not “ill” anymore, I have reached a normal weight, and I’ve been able to maintain it for a while. But I feel much more ill with anorexia now than ever before. I have started to restrict again, because I want to become underweight again. I want to have an empty stomach, I want to see the number on the scales go down. I restricted last week, but I managed to GAIN a lot of weight. I really don’t understand why and how. The weight gain triggered me to continue restricting, and now it’s all I can think of. 

But it kinda feels impossible to lose weight, because I don’t trust my body anymore. I fear that I won’t lose any weight, no matter how much I restrict or not. I’ve also started to watch documentaries about people with anorexia, the same documentaries I’ve watched multiple times before. I only watch them to trigger myself into continue restricting and eating as little as possible. I feel so defeated whenever I eat more than planned, and get an urge to punish myself for eating. 

My therapist told me at our appointment earlier this week that I’ve come a long way in recovery, and how I’m at a much better place now than when we first started talking. It kinda feels like she doesn’t realize how bad I’m actually doing right now. But at the same time, I don’t want her to find out. Because if she finds out that I’ve started restricting again, she’s going to refer me to a different outpatient facility.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"My story may be triggering because I’m confused and want context for y’all’s opinions :( 

I’m 27 years old and I’ve had a very rough year I got very sick with stomach ulcers and began a bad food intake habit. I started shedding weight QUICKLY (I was a bigger girl too). I became self obsessed tbh I didn’t wanna stop I started liking myself again… and at the time not eating or little to none was easy because of the pain. But, it became more very fast, I realized I started pushing myself to not eat, then started to actually push the hunger away, and the scale was obsessive, the compliments kept me going and then BAM. I looked in the mirror one day and was confused, I was skinny but my face is aging, my body is weak, I’m tired all the time, I can’t stand up without getting light headed, I sit in the shower, my hairs falling out, heart palpitations regularly, every morning it’s hard to breathe. But my blood pressure and pulse is fine when I go to the doctors.
I start therapy tomorrow but I’m anxious. 
Sometimes I eat 1 meal and some small snacks a day which makes me feel like it’s not really as bad as my body feels? If that makes sense but I started research it’s a year now I’ve been doing this.

&lt;p&gt;I’m 27 years old and I’ve had a very rough year I got very sick with stomach ulcers and began a bad food intake habit. I started shedding weight QUICKLY (I was a bigger girl too). I became self obsessed tbh I didn’t wanna stop I started liking myself again… and at the time not eating or little to none was easy because of the pain. But, it became more very fast, I realized I started pushing myself to not eat, then started to actually push the hunger away, and the scale was obsessive, the compliments kept me going and then BAM. I looked in the mirror one day and was confused, I was skinny but my face is aging, my body is weak, I’m tired all the time, I can’t stand up without getting light headed, I sit in the shower, my hairs falling out, heart palpitations regularly, every morning it’s hard to breathe. But my blood pressure and pulse is fine when I go to the doctors.
I start therapy tomorrow but I’m anxious. 
Sometimes I eat 1 meal and some small snacks a day which makes me feel like it’s not really as bad as my body feels? If that makes sense but I started research it’s a year now I’ve been doing this. I’m anemic now, and My face is so sad looking and my skin isn’t right. I don’t look healthy anymore. I haven’t weighed myself in a month and I’m spiraling over it because the body dysmorphia. I have kids I don’t want to die and I’m scared I’m getting close. I just teeter the idea I’m not as bad because I randomly don’t restrict as much but the thoughts never leave.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi, in 2014-2016 I think i struggled with an eating disorder (restricted, purged, obsessed over food etc) but when I sought medical advice to see if I did have an ED the doctor said “well you look fine to me”. Ever since then I’ve always felt like my eating disorder was a lie, or all in my head, or i was just making it all up for attention.

Fast forward to 1 month ago, i feel like i relapsed, but idk if i can even say that because idk if i even had a real eating disorder before. But within this 1 month, ive lost enough weight in a significant way, and now i am def underweight. If i were to seek medical attention though would this be considered to be anorexia? I definitely fit all the other criteria just worried if it still goes by a *certain weight number* in order to be officially diagnosed. I just really don’t feel like being invalidated by the health care system for a number is an experience that might be helpful to right now.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hey guys,

So I have been trying to recover from my ED for about three years now with no luck because I cannot afford therapy or the kind of program you usually go to for this sort of thing. In the last year or so I decided I'm tired of living this way and to just go ahead and eat and ditch the exercise. This was really difficult for me because I was an athletics coach and personal trainer for years, so cutting out exercise was a huge lifestyle change for me. I started going to the gym and have been maintaining my weight for a month and a half now.

Recently went to visit my family and they made comments about my weight gain since I am slightly overweight (not really though. It depends on what chart you look at). Everyone else in my family is skinny and I think my mom has an eating disorder also. I explained to them what happened and they eased up but I know they all think I'm fat and probably talk about it when I'm not there. I usually feel really confident these days, which has been awesome. I never felt so confident and happy with myself when I was restricting. The only problem is someone took a picture of a yoga class I taught this morning and I look really fat!!!!!!!

I was so proud of myself and all the work I had been doing to get my life together up until this point. I'm so upset and ashamed that I got so upset over one picture (which doesn't even look that bad and tbh I'm proud of how jacked I am after only a month in the gym). I feel like I've always been so self conscious of my appearance and always think that I look horrible but at least when I was restricting I didn't have to worry about looking fat in photos! I wish I could just have both a skinny body and the kind of life that comes when you actually eat well.

I feel so stupid. After almost a year of working on undoing my bad eating habits and building myself up and feeling good I keep having these upsets where I see myself and I'm kind of big and I just lose it. I know my family thinks I'm ugly and I fucking deserve it for being so sick in the first place. Why can't I just look good again?!?!?!?!

I NEVER want to go back to restricting and all of the horrible habits I had gotten into which almost killed me many times. I'm just angry because I know I'll never be skinny like that again because it is NOT HEALTHY and NOT conducive to the kind of active lifestyle I want to live. I know for a fact though that people will always see pictures of me when I was skinny and make those lame comments like ""wow you were so beautiful when you were younger"" as if I wasn't fucking dying at the time. I looked through old photo albums and you can see me get skinnier and skinnier with every passing year. It's depressing! I'm just terrified now. I want to look good the way I did when I was skinny, but I know what's best for me is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and self-confidence (my increased confidence definitely came from my weight gain because random men finally left me the fuck alone so I could think and speak for myself). Living this way has changed my life so much in the past few months for the better, I never want to restrict again.

I know my family thinks I&amp;#39;m ugly and I fucking deserve it for being so sick in the first place. Why can&amp;#39;t I just look good again?!?!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I NEVER want to go back to restricting and all of the horrible habits I had gotten into which almost killed me many times. I&amp;#39;m just angry because I know I&amp;#39;ll never be skinny like that again because it is NOT HEALTHY and NOT conducive to the kind of active lifestyle I want to live. I know for a fact though that people will always see pictures of me when I was skinny and make those lame comments like &amp;quot;wow you were so beautiful when you were younger&amp;quot; as if I wasn&amp;#39;t fucking dying at the time. I looked through old photo albums and you can see me get skinnier and skinnier with every passing year. It&amp;#39;s depressing! I&amp;#39;m just terrified now. I want to look good the way I did when I was skinny, but I know what&amp;#39;s best for me is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and self-confidence (my increased confidence definitely came from my weight gain because random men finally left me the fuck alone so I could think and speak for myself). Living this way has changed my life so much in the past few months for the better, I never want to restrict again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to look good.&lt;/p&gt;

But I also do feel sort of peaceful and it’s nice not having to deal with constantly being triggered by weight loss posts, other people’s running/exercise stats, posts normalizing disordered eating, pictures of conventionally attractive thin/fit people, people posting about how great life is while mine is a literal burning dumpster fire, etc. I feel like I should just push through and continue my hiatus.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I (33f) have struggled with anorexia on and off since I was 13. I would typically have a few years restricting followed by weight restoration and adequate food intake, and ping back and forth. I finally stayed recovered for the past 3 years, and I do want it to stick this time.

While I’m at a healthy weight, getting a regular period, and eating enough, I still have almost no appetite. I’ve tried so many strategies in terms of meal frequency and macronutrient ratios, but nothing helps. Now I’m stuck in a place where if I don’t wait until very late in the day, I will get sick if I eat more than a small amount, or some of my food will involuntarily come back up. I have been to a Dr and they found nothing wrong with me except elevated liver enzymes which is odd because I hardly drink and don’t eat sugar. 

I also don’t feel like I have made much progress mentally. I still dislike my body 3 years in. I don’t try in clothes in stores or with friends bc I will likely start crying, and while I don’t restrict food I still feel terrible and gross for every bite I take but I don’t want to keep damaging my health so I continue eating enough to maintain my weight. I’m at a healthy (not low or high BMI) size, and I’ve been stable for years. I feel totally hopeless. My relationship with food and body image is essentially unchanged and it’s like I’ve got the worst of both worlds (the negative mental aspects of an eating disorder but without the skinny part).

Now I’m stuck in a place where if I don’t wait until very late in the day, I will get sick if I eat more than a small amount, or some of my food will involuntarily come back up. I have been to a Dr and they found nothing wrong with me except elevated liver enzymes which is odd because I hardly drink and don’t eat sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don’t feel like I have made much progress mentally. I still dislike my body 3 years in. I don’t try in clothes in stores or with friends bc I will likely start crying, and while I don’t restrict food I still feel terrible and gross for every bite I take but I don’t want to keep damaging my health so I continue eating enough to maintain my weight. I’m at a healthy (not low or high BMI) size, and I’ve been stable for years. I feel totally hopeless. My relationship with food and body image is essentially unchanged and it’s like I’ve got the worst of both worlds (the negative mental aspects of an eating disorder but without the skinny part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else had something similar happen, and were you able to address any of those issues?&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi, throwaway and really hoping she doesn’t use Reddit let alone this thread.

I’m hoping to get some advice or be pointed in the right direction to get advice. 

One of my close friends/roommates (f22) has anorexia and has made a promise to me and her therapist to attempt recovery, and she requested she do it from home so she can keep working remotely. (Important info: Her parents are not involved in her life). I had one session with both my friend and her team who talked to both of us about accountability and what that looks like for my friend. I’m more than happy to take on this role and keep my friend accountable, I love her and care about her and her recovery is important to me. 

However, she clearly does not want to be held accountable. She does not have an option to move out due to finances… which is probably for the best. I am not forcing her to do anything, per therapist instructions. I simply point out when she is lying about food/exercise and remind her when she forgets about meals/snacks. But recently she’s told me that she doesn’t need a parent and she doesn’t need to be policed. I told her it’s obviously not my intention, but I’m trying to keep her from ending up in the hospital and she knows that I have to tell her team the truth if she is not making an effort. I don’t want to, and I hate that it’s an ultimatum I just want to see more effort on her end. We set up boundaries in therapy before starting this accountability thing. 

She is independent in almost every other aspect, so I don’t feel like I have to do everything for her. Outside of this we have an incredible relationship and I do view her as a sister.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"tw ed (no numbers)

i don‘t know what to do. I‘m currently in treatment for my bpd, previously I lost a lot of weight during my stay in the psych ward.
On the first day I got weighed &amp; I gained weight which kinda made me freak out.
But I worked against it &amp; continued to eat. 
They did tell me that I‘m gonna get kicked out if my bmi gets under a certain number.
Which is really close to the number on the scale.
The thing is that the day before I ate a lot, but didn‘t visit the restroom &amp; was kinda constipated for around a week
Additionally I wore heavy clothes &amp; wearing shoes. They barely reduced the number bc of the clothing 
I‘m a really shy person so I was too scared to say anything &amp; also kinda dissociating so I could barely stay conscious

So I know that the number is higher than my actual weight.
The problem is that I have to step on the scale sporadically so I can’t even wear the right clothes for that day.

So it‘s been two weeks &amp; I don‘t know if I should say anything but I‘m pretty sure I‘m below the number. 
I kinda restricted on the weekend but not before. 
I drank a lot of matcha &amp; now everything‘s out.
I feel a lot lighter which feels great but also I‘m kinda freaking out

It‘s pretty warm so I can‘t wear the clothes I wore that day.

&lt;p&gt;i don‘t know what to do. I‘m currently in treatment for my bpd, previously I lost a lot of weight during my stay in the psych ward.
On the first day I got weighed &amp;amp; I gained weight which kinda made me freak out.
But I worked against it &amp;amp; continued to eat. 
They did tell me that I‘m gonna get kicked out if my bmi gets under a certain number.
Which is really close to the number on the scale.
The thing is that the day before I ate a lot, but didn‘t visit the restroom &amp;amp; was kinda constipated for around a week
Additionally I wore heavy clothes &amp;amp; wearing shoes. They barely reduced the number bc of the clothing 
I‘m a really shy person so I was too scared to say anything &amp;amp; also kinda dissociating so I could barely stay conscious&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know that the number is higher than my actual weight.
The problem is that I have to step on the scale sporadically so I can’t even wear the right clothes for that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it‘s been two weeks &amp;amp; I don‘t know if I should say anything but I‘m pretty sure I‘m below the number. 
I kinda restricted on the weekend but not before. 
I drank a lot of matcha &amp;amp; now everything‘s out.
I feel a lot lighter which feels great but also I‘m kinda freaking out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‘s pretty warm so I can‘t wear the clothes I wore that day. 
I‘m scared that if I tell them they make me step on the scale &amp;amp; then kick me out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I should just gain weight but I‘m honestly not ready &amp;amp; there‘s a lot of other stuff I need to work on&lt;/p&gt;

earlier this year i relapsed because of a conversation i had with a friend. I fell into it kinda hard, especially cause summer was coming up. and as you know eds take away from every other aspect of your life. i was naive and thought that our love for each other would somehow make us immune to this. but as the months went by i was isolating even from her, being distracted with my own appearance, ignoring her texts cause logging my intake was somehow more important, we had sex less and less often cause of my insecurities when she'd never said anything negative about my appearance. 

so about 2 months ago she just told me we'd grown apart and the person i'd become wasn't who she needed anymore. she me her outright mentioned an eating disorder, but that's pretty much what it was. i spent the whole night crying but i couldn't even be mad at her. she needed someone who can pay attention to her and maintain a relationship, i feel like being anorexic made me too selfish for her. part of me wishes she'd done something wrong, but she didn't, so my only choice is to see myself as the villain. i know it's possible for neither of us to be the bad guy, my brain knows that but my heart doesn't feel that way. 

i blame myself for it. a lot. especially knowing she would love me no matter what my weight was, and i fucked everything up by caring about just that


im not happy with myself. i know i didn't choose to have anorexia but it feels like if i just tried harder to  recover, she would still be with me. i keep replaying moments where i was preoccupied with myself and i could have done something for her instead. i really regret that i didnt tell her things got bad again, i knew for a fact she'd support me, but i also knew she'd be worried and try and stop me from getting worse. so i just kept it to myself and now she thinks i don't prioritize her anymore. and it's too late to tell her now cause it would just feel like i'm guilting her into getting back with me again, and it's over anyways, she made her decision and i can't change it now. 

i've never felt so stupid in my life. we met when we were both 15, now we're 19 and 20. the girl who i practically grew up with, was planning on marrying, consider the love of my life, gone all cause of a fucking eating disorder. it's been a wake up call, but i still can't bring myself to recover. i'm not even emotionally stable enough to try. i have no idea what to do with myself again

just so no one worries too much, i have plenty other people who are there for me and thank god for that, i have no intentions of hurting myself either. just very, very heartbroken is all. i don't know where else to vent cause i still don't want anyone worrying, but i needed this off my chest. thanks for reading",t2_dqrvyjao,False,,0,False,vent. my ed ruined my relationship,[],r/AnorexiaNervosa,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_w78ni5,False,light,0.94,,public,22,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent,False,22,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1658703921.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.AnorexiaNervosa,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, title. i met her at the lowest point in my life as an insecure teenager, and thanks to her i learnt to love myself and my life. we spent 3.5 years together and she was the most incredible person i&amp;#39;ve ever met. everything i always thought someone like me didn&amp;#39;t deserve, but for some reason she saw something in me. she knew i&amp;#39;d had a few eds in the past, but i was fine for most of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi! I'm Lillith, just to put down some context, I'm a minor, undiagnosed, and while I can't officially say that I have an ED, it's pretty obvious that I do. My ED kinda consists of what I call ""phases"" I have a phase where I'm full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. Then the other is binging. It doesn't stsy long (a week or so) and doesn't happen often, it's triggered when I don't get food I'm body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, I then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. Sometimes when I have no choice I eat like a ""normal person"" but try to burn it off by exercising (I do at home biking and sometimes sit-ups). What triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. I had gained a lot during the summer bc I did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, I shed the pounds naturally when I got back to school because I would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn't snake at school. (TW: Numbers/talk about my weight) So I went from **kg for 164cm in August, to **kg for 165cm in November. Then I started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school (my friends called them my fangirls) they would say I was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you're so thin! That's so cool! 
I crave compliments, affection, I want to keep it forever, I have a past with bullying and parents I disappointed cuz I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until 8th grade (so really). I would rarely get compliments, so now I do everything to keep them. While I was someone who didn't want to care about they way I looked because I knew I was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. My mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack ""be careful you're going to end up like this summer""
I slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of **g made its way into my head. So here was the starting point of my ED. Now I'm kinda deep into it but it's summer break so skipping meals is hard, I try to exercise, I skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don't so I can't. But I also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. 
Here's the thing, I don't like throwing up, but that didn't stop me from trying to make myself purge, I've never been able to though. Until today, I was trying to purge but couldn't, I went on internet, searched ""how to make yourself puke"" found something, tried it once, succeeded. I did about three times until I just couldn't bc I still don't like to throw up. I exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. I felt the dizziness I feel when ""it's working"" I'm used to it and it's strangely satisfying since I associate it with weight loss. The purging too, while I still don't like to puke, I had this feeling of satisfaction. 

Now, I don't know what to think about this... did I just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ED? Or is it just me being dramatic about it, and I probably won't pick up on this behavior? Searching for some advice :) 
I hope what I said was clear,

Could this trigger feelings of extreme hunger again? As if my body is panicking? Or if I’ve not got energy from restricting and it needs more to boost itself?

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I have a hard time restricting my food, so I do a lot of intermittent fasting. Since it is Summer, I have been eating my first meal at 11am and my last one at 3pm. My parents dislike this though. My parents always want me to eat dinner with them, but they always make us eat insanely late. They try to make me eat at 8pm-10pm. They know how important not eating late is to me (aside from the weight benefits, it also allows me to fall asleep. I used to not be able to sleep until 3am-4am, but when I do not eat late, I can fall asleep early). They could not care less though.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Back story: I'm 36 and have had an ED, mostly anorexia, for years in the past. I recovered, mostly, despite being discharged with a 'management' plan rather than a relapse prevention plan. I've been more or less healthy for a decade and I basically ate whatever I wanted trying to avoid triggering relapse. 
I've had a higher weight than I could be comfortable with after my second baby, and I was not happy with my 'sugar addiction'. 
Anyhow. A year ago I got sick with something like long covid but not long covid. I burned myself out (because I am still the same idiot who tried to climb mountains with a very low weight and anaemia) by keeping going and basically I've had nausea very often, leading to weight loss, and after getting a really bad bout of depression, basically some profoundly anorexic stuff in my mind. 
And the weight is beginning to match. 


So. The clothes. 
I love clothes, I love making it look good. It's my bit of creative play, and I kind of missed that when I was at my highest weight and during pregnancies because I bought and wore cheaper, poorer fitting clothes with boob access. (For breastfeeding, not other stuff). 
Not too long ago, I invested in basically a big wardrobe upheaval because I figured I was at a weight I could and should maintain as a mother and be healthy with it. I had already tossed the baby-era clothes a while ago.

This weekend I 'had' to basically go through my closet and take out everything that is too big and doesn't really look good if worn 'oversized', it is a lot, and some stuff still have the tags on. I took some of my pre pregnancy clothes off Vinted again (from the time after the discharge with minimal weight restoration), some things even from uni. I fit the jeans I never intended to fit again but just kept because they remind me of adventures. My body has definitely changed.

And I don't know how to feel about it. 

The intention is positive: I want to look put together, I want to be kinder towards myself, I want to actually not draw attention to my weight. I want to not be confronted with clothes that should fit but don't everyday. 

My anorexic mindset enjoys it but fuck her. 

But in the end: isn't this kind of defeat? Or is it acceptance? 
Realistically I know that for now the only attainable goal would be to stop losing weight, but it also feels like defeat and maybe a bit crazy.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi! So lately, I've seen this girl I had met about 10 years ago at a summer camp post a lot of worrying stories of her on Instagram. It's always pictures where you can see that she has lost a lot of weight (she was already skinny to start with) and looks very sick.

I don't know if she's completely oblivious to the fact that she's sick or if she knows but ""likes"" it or if she knows and is implicitly asking for help. I'm very worried.  
My question is: should I send her a message telling her that if she needs someone to talk to or advice I'm here? Or just telling her nicely that she needs to get help. I'm myself a pretty much recovered anorexic so I would not be coming out of nowhere.

Today scared the shit out of me and I want to know if this is because of AN or if anyone else experiences or experienced something similar. 

Never thought I possibly had anorexia or disordered eating until a few years back when a friend put herself into full-time treatment and I weighed less than her at the same height.

I am a ballet dancer and it's been hard to have enough stamina for class even after eating protein and higher-calorie foods all day until I go to class. I am not afraid of gaining weight, just not sure if I'd feel comfortable seeing myself at a normal body weight.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"My boyfriend of over a year and I had a very messy break up. He became very angry at me while drunk and while he didn’t harm me, he was very cruel and was so ashamed of his actions that he broke off the relationship. I was devastated. I wanted to relapse into my ED so badly but I managed to keep on track with recovery. I even challenged fear foods and felt proud of my progress despite my pain and desire to fall back on anorexia.

It has been a month since he dumped me but now my boyfriend is very regretful of his actions and says he was being a coward for running away from our relationship instead of taking responsibility and do better. I’m not ready to go back to the way things were, but I was hopeful we could rebuild trust and recover the relationship. Things were going pretty well - we met a few times to talk about things and the conversations were hard but helped a lot.

Then he told me he had sex with another girl while we were broken up (2days after he dumped me). He told me he felt sick about what he’d done and that she meant nothing to him, but finding this out has completely devastated me. I keep looking her up on social media, comparing her body to mine and if she’s thinner than me. Fighting off relapsing is getting harder and harder and I’m worried it’s going to be stronger than me now. I feel ashamed every time I eat and disgusted with myself. I feel like a fraud for wanting to return to anorexia while still eating food. I feel like a fraud. I miss my sick body and how being so sick overwhelmed everything else, especially my pain.

I’m trying to be strong but I want to give up. I never told anyone I was struggling because my sister has anorexia and was always sicker than me. Any recovery I’ve made, I have done alone and in secret. Does anyone have any suggestions for handling these negative emotions and my desire to relapse.

I know what you're thinking; Why not just block her? 


First, she'll know and it will obviously cause drama. I'm not the confrontational type. Also recently she's been tolerant of me, I don't want it to go back to how it was. I'm more than happy with her ignoring me or pretending I don't exist. We are in similar circles of friend groups, she's more popular and better liked and I don't want them to turn against me.

Second, A small part of me wants to be like her. She has what I always wanted in myself. Beauty, self acceptance, and validation from others.

I have struggled (and maybe still do to an extent) with ED (and I have BDD) so I kind of understand ED and things like that. However, my girlfriend is in recovery for anorexia, but i have not experienced this myself. 

I’m wondering (from person experience or just advice), are there things I should know about being in a relationship with someone who has an ED (and is in recovery), are there things I should say or shouldn’t say, things I should keep an eye on? That type of thing. 

Another thing is too, she likes physical compliments, though I have no idea how to go about that besides the whole cute, beautiful thing. I don’t know what the right thing to say is.

&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering (from person experience or just advice), are there things I should know about being in a relationship with someone who has an ED (and is in recovery), are there things I should say or shouldn’t say, things I should keep an eye on? That type of thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is too, she likes physical compliments, though I have no idea how to go about that besides the whole cute, beautiful thing. I don’t know what the right thing to say is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"So my mum has always been very thin, but I recon looks frail now. She has suffered a lot of trauma in her life, which I know she has not processed.

She’s now not going out for dinner again. I’m really worried as she’s been losing weight for a while. She says she just can’t eat but after I questioned her admitted she hasn’t been eating right. 

She doesn’t want to be as thin but has no appetite anymore, drinks alcohol everyday (long-standing problem). It’s not a weight control thing. Just not hungry. I’ve realised - and she’s admitted she’s been lying about eating to not make me worry.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"After a long and descent talk she finally found out, that she has to change things in her life and tries to recover. While discussing some interesting things came to light. But first some facts:
- She has AN since 9 and is 38 now.
- she has three kids, one of them, the youngest, is mine
- the ex partner and father of the other two kids has the mission to make her life as bad as possible, because he hates his self even more. Unfortunately he is a good father though. 
- She struggles with her emotions, kids training, trying to get everything in her family life together and to manage that she fled into excessive sports and low food input.

I found some interesting things out, maybe you are familiar with that. Maybe you could help me to let her help herself: 

- she recalls her entire life to be focused on her weight. This always gave her control.
- she does not know who she actually is and what the things are, that she loves. There is none.
- to compensate the lack of her own desires, she gives everything she has to her kids. Those are struggling too, due to the years of cruel legal and emotional fights with the ex.
- because she never had contact with herself, she cannot gain energy, her only desire is to do sports and an stuff
- so now, after many exhausting years in her living situation she finds herself in a decent mother's burnout with hard depressions and an growing urge of controlling her weight. 

Her life is a mess, and so is mine now. As I am not living with her, I wish she could let the kids go and move to me and stops fighting for them because it destroyes her. Not a noble thought, I know. But who could judge me, most do not know how exhausting and messy all this is. And I think this would be the best for all of us, especially for the children. But she as a mother with no other purpose in her life than living for them and barely no self awareness, is so scared doing the step, because there is nothing waiting for her. Well I am.

Pretty much everyone in my life knows about my ED, that is, except for my family. 

Lately, I’ve been struggling a lot. I only really eat one meal a day, which is better than nothing I suppose, but still isn’t very good. For the past like three or four days, I’ve felt really sick every morning. I’m really nauseous and my stomach hurts and it just goes on for a couple hours until it just eventually goes away. And, well, I don’t know how much longer I can put up with it. 

I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I need help, I know I do. I want to get better, I want to recover, I want to eat healthily. But I just don’t know how to do that on my own. I’m terrified of how my family will react and what will happen.

So, to those of you struggling with eating disorders and have sought out help, how did you go about it? What was your experience? What would you have done differently? How did your family react? Really, any information or shared experiences would do me good.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I feel so utterly broken. I've been dealing with anorexia since I was 12. I went through some very traumatic things because of it. My life wasn't mine because of others. I turned 18 in May and things were going good for the past year and I saw hope. I got my GED, I was no longer at the mercy of idiotic, sadistic even higher ups. 

My weight has been pretty low for the past year. I was eating well and not restricting. Not under the constant threat of hospitals. I was just living life at a weight I felt comfortable at with some ups and downs.

Gradually over the past couple of months I've been eating less. I was so tired of rigidly eating six times a day and so on a vacation I tried out eating more intuitively and it felt amazing. When I came back home I had lost some weight but not much. My team was happy about my positive experience and hoped I could replicate it at home without losing weight. Doing so proved challenging. I ended up just eating less. At one point I got to a number that was a little shocking. Deep down though, it felt good. I went up about a pound from that and maintained for a bit. 

Last week was my first weight in a couple of weeks. I can't remember my weight beforehand exactly but the general range. The number couldn't have been up a lot but just seeing it broke my heart. For the first time in years the scale made me cry. I hadn't tried to lose weight intentionally in quite a while but I decided it was time. I barely ate for a few days and quickly could hardly function. I slowly had to begin eating more. By the end of the week I was doing pretty good and I felt good in my body. 

This morning I awaited the scale, looking for the relief of loss. The appointment was hostile to begin with. When I stepped on the scale, at first I couldn't process it. It was like it wasn't real. Somehow, it was a pound **up** from last week. The number broke me. Tears flooded. I was miserable. How, how? What can I do? I ate less and went up? My weakness led the scale up? This has never happened before. I've often quite easily lost weight. I already felt a little pathetic for already being lethargic after a few days of starvation, now I feel hopeless.

But since I'm just starting restriction again i don't feel like it will get that bad and i haven't experience bad health effects yet.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"

Hi everyone. The title may be strange so let me get it straight.

I have been diagnosed with anorexia when I was still a child so... puberty fucked up at the real start.
I still don't have regular period, besides an amazing osteoporosis which makes me waiting for medical appointments sitting next to 60-70 old ladies. 
And they don't know THEY are the amateurs, because my bones are classified as 80-90 old women's ones would ;)

Jokes aside, my body is pretty fucked up, physiologically speaking. Consequences of not eating enough and balanced are here to see and likely not to be solved soon.


I won't go into details about the reasons this topic came to my mind because it involves also another person, but the fact is that I have never felt sexual desires. 
The idea of sex never comes to my mind, and even if I feel (and I swear, I have felt this one) when I'm in love or attracted to someone, thinking of doing things with him isn't really a thing for me. I don't feel it necessary. It's kind of repulsing to me. 
I feel like I am sort of far far faaar away from that sphere. 

This btw doesn't include hugs, holding hands, kisses, staying in bed only in underwear, but when it comes to touching some ""parts of the body""... I really start to feel uncomfortable. I can say I hate it.

Times ago I thought I was into the spectre of being asexual, but afterhsome deep thinking about this... Well.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Before Covid, I was in recovery for a really long time, things were going really well, then..... Covid hit and I've been stuck in my apartment alone for over two years.  Well, when you lock an anorexic (even one who's in recovery) up alone for two whole years and nobody ever sees what they eat or what they weigh... guess what happens?  Yeah, you know, relapse.  A very, very, bad relapse, I got to my lowest weight and BMI ever, to the point I got really scared about endangering my health.  Well, I'm still restricting, but I've worked really hard and have gotten my BMI up to where I'm not scared I'll have a heart attack tomorrow, only I've got another problem.  After Covid, I'm getting together with friends again and getting out and especially getting out to hear music (most of my friends are artists or musicians) and in May I started getting together with one old friend, and he said, ""Come on over to my apartment, I'll make dinner, and we'll hang out and talk.""   TRIGGER TRIGGER TRIGGER!  Now over the years, I hid my ED from everybody because I felt so ashamed of it and always gave them the usual bullshit about how I had a high metabolism and I'm just naturally skinny, etc. etc.  But in May, I had to break down and  fess up to this friend, because I was still not in recovery enough to eat in front of him, I told him all about my ED.  So he said, ""That's okay, I'll just eat before you come over and I'll wash the dishes and everything because I don't want to upset you or anything.""  Now, I don't know if you know this about guys, but they NEVER want to talk about feelings or emotional problems or especially about things like an ED.  So neither he or I have mentioned my ED since that talk.  We have plans to go out to hear some music Friday and... I don't know if I should suggest to him that we go out and eat beforehand.   We always used to do that.  I think maybe I could eat something like a salad, I don't know.  l have so much shame about my ED that I really feel so much shame and regret about even telling him about it and I hate bringing it up again.

Covid hit and I&amp;#39;ve been stuck in my apartment alone for over two years.  Well, when you lock an anorexic (even one who&amp;#39;s in recovery) up alone for two whole years and nobody ever sees what they eat or what they weigh... guess what happens?  Yeah, you know, relapse.  A very, very, bad relapse, I got to my lowest weight and BMI ever, to the point I got really scared about endangering my health.  Well, I&amp;#39;m still restricting, but I&amp;#39;ve worked really hard and have gotten my BMI up to where I&amp;#39;m not scared I&amp;#39;ll have a heart attack tomorrow, only I&amp;#39;ve got another problem.  After Covid, I&amp;#39;m getting together with friends again and getting out and especially getting out to hear music (most of my friends are artists or musicians) and in May I started getting together with one old friend, and he said, &amp;quot;Come on over to my apartment, I&amp;#39;ll make dinner, and we&amp;#39;ll hang out and talk.&amp;quot;   TRIGGER TRIGGER TRIGGER!  Now over the years, I hid my ED from everybody because I felt so ashamed of it and always gave them the usual bullshit about how I had a high metabolism and I&amp;#39;m just naturally skinny, etc. etc.  But in May, I had to break down and  fess up to this friend, because I was still not in recovery enough to eat in front of him, I told him all about my ED.  So he said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;ll just eat before you come over and I&amp;#39;ll wash the dishes and everything because I don&amp;#39;t want to upset you or anything.&amp;quot;  Now, I don&amp;#39;t know if you know this about guys, but they NEVER want to talk about feelings or emotional problems or especially about things like an ED.  So neither he or I have mentioned my ED since that talk.  We have plans to go out to hear some music Friday and... I don&amp;#39;t know if I should suggest to him that we go out and eat beforehand.   We always used to do that.  I think maybe I could eat something like a salad, I don&amp;#39;t know.  l have so much shame about my ED that I really feel so much shame and regret about even telling him about it and I hate bringing it up again.  But I also don&amp;#39;t want to go through life not eating around my friends, that would feel like such a loss to me.  I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I felt like making this post to help those who are in relationships with someone with an ED, but anorexia specifically. I feel like the luckiest person alive to be in a relationship with the my partner, they're so good with helping me. This will kinda all be based of what they do for me. Also I just wanna celebrate how nice they are to me, hope you all don't mind.

Also I am nearing the end of my recovery but I am still unwell, it's just some extra support from them that helps, if I was very unwell a lot of this stuff would anger me and wouldn't help. Please bare that in mind. 

1) kinda obvious, no diet talk, no food talk, no fitness talk. Don't talk about steps, c*lories, nutrition and so on. It's not helpful and will make them very uncomfortable. Casual conversation like I want to go to the gym to get stronger is ok, but things like I wanna lose weight aren't ok.

2) When taking them out to restaurants avoid all vegan and veggies places as many use those lifestyles to restrict. Also in the UK since the new c*lorie rule on menu, try for small local business* to avoid this or look online or ask in the restaurant for calorie free menus. If you're in a situation where youve got to have a menu with c*lories, offer to read out the menu or take a photo of the menu with the information covered.
*if the company has less than 250 employees they don't have to show the information

3) use a sharpie to remove nutritional information from food you buy, or remove the packaging. Multipacks are good as the individual pieces inside don't have any of this info most the time. Also it's worth carrying one around.

4) positive reinforcement of good actions. Don't go over the top and wait until they've fully finished what they're doing and out of the situation else it might be triggering. Simple things like I'm proud of you, you've done really well and well done are great to hear.

5) ask how to support them in times of distress when you're with them. My partner will lie on top of me and cuddle me when I feel bad after eating. Its the most kind and amazing thing they do, and everytime they do it, it helps so much. When you're doing what you're doing for them, focus on calming, distraction and comfort. Don't talk about what's wrong, it'll make it worse as it can retrigger someone.

6) when youre not with them and you're texting, unless you feel overwhelmed, just listen to them vent. Sometimes all someone needs is to tell someone the thoughts in their head, have some reassurance or just be listened to and it helps a lot. But put yourself first, if you can't cope, let them know it's a bad time.

7) set an example. Anaylis your relationship with food. Do you restrict, do you have a bad relationship with food. If yes, work on that immediately and do not show that to them. I find copying what my partner eats and dos a really helpful way to improve myself. If theyre getting an ice cream I'll get it. If they're eating a challenge food of mine I'll ask to eat a bit of theirs or get my own. If they're not exercising today, then I don't need to ever. All you need to do is eat like normal basically. 

8)gently encourage three snacks and three meals. Just question them around those times of day. Have had youre snack yet? Are you hungry? Do you wanna get some food? X looks good, we should get some. Don't force it, don't be relate it to recovery, just know what they need to eat and generally encourage it

9) know when it's too much. You are the most important person to you, if you aren't coping with them being unwell, then get support yourself or leave. If you take anything away from this post, it's that you can not fix them. You can't take away their suffering. You can't make them recover. Anorexia will turn them into a vile person when challenged. If you can't cope with being around their illness, leave. When dating a person with an ED, you can't ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist, and asking them to hide it or keep it away from you is dangerous for them. There's no shame in saying you can't cope, it's better for both of you to be honest and open.

I can't be bothered to write full paragraphs about this but here's the rest of it.

No weight related complements. Don't tell them they're skinny and don't tell them they're not fat, it's what the ED wants to hear. Tell them they're pretty, have a lovely body or you wouldn't change anything about them (only say that if they're weight restored and don't need to gain more.)

Cook meals with them and do food shopping with them. Very good if you're at uni with ur partner.

Call out ED behaviour when you see it but be kind and gentle. Prepare for lying and anger, if you get this, don't push them, just leave it.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"TW (suicdl) It's been 5 years since starting recovery, there was a relapse maybe 2 years later and since then I would say I've been much more purge like. 
Since the last relapse I have become a lot less restrictive,; I lost control to it I started losing my hair and started drinking alcohol and then just started binging and since then have really struggled to eat right. I never feel full even when I'm in physical pain I still don't feel full, equally when I don't eat for a long time I will feel weak but not actually hungry, and then I'll start feeling that familiar evil high and feel scared, like there's a murder in the backseat while I'm driving. I've been struggling with drinking and drugs, and the effect they have over appetite and the laxative effects.
Even though I'm definitely a healthy weight I still feel famished, and so tired and dirty. I'm actually now more on the heavy side, with high BP. Some negative sexual experiences and the guilt of yoyoing has plunged my into another binge and into isolation in my home.
 In the past 2 years my weight has gone up and down drastically 
I'm scared my physical health can't take it but mentally I'm having very bad ideation thoughts as I fear the damage I keep doing to my body and the struggle to actually live a real life. 5 years ago It nearly killed me, it's killed my love life, life feels meaningless and like I'm failing when I'm not starving or living by food rules. I'm binging a bit but I can feel my anger rising and that I know it's one way or the other. I have no control over my relationship with food I'm either starving or binging I'm so exhausted from being this way all my life, all I think about is food my body and how much I hate them both.
Side note- my mum knows how much pain I go through especially when binging and I've seen her take joy in it, joy in my weight yoyoing my dad is similar and it breaks my heart. These yoyo periods are damaging my bones, heart and making me suicidal and they seem to find it amusing.

Since the last relapse I have become a lot less restrictive,; I lost control to it I started losing my hair and started drinking alcohol and then just started binging and since then have really struggled to eat right. I never feel full even when I&amp;#39;m in physical pain I still don&amp;#39;t feel full, equally when I don&amp;#39;t eat for a long time I will feel weak but not actually hungry, and then I&amp;#39;ll start feeling that familiar evil high and feel scared, like there&amp;#39;s a murder in the backseat while I&amp;#39;m driving. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with drinking and drugs, and the effect they have over appetite and the laxative effects.
Even though I&amp;#39;m definitely a healthy weight I still feel famished, and so tired and dirty. I&amp;#39;m actually now more on the heavy side, with high BP. Some negative sexual experiences and the guilt of yoyoing has plunged my into another binge and into isolation in my home.
 In the past 2 years my weight has gone up and down drastically 
I&amp;#39;m scared my physical health can&amp;#39;t take it but mentally I&amp;#39;m having very bad ideation thoughts as I fear the damage I keep doing to my body and the struggle to actually live a real life. 5 years ago It nearly killed me, it&amp;#39;s killed my love life, life feels meaningless and like I&amp;#39;m failing when I&amp;#39;m not starving or living by food rules. I&amp;#39;m binging a bit but I can feel my anger rising and that I know it&amp;#39;s one way or the other. I have no control over my relationship with food I&amp;#39;m either starving or binging I&amp;#39;m so exhausted from being this way all my life, all I think about is food my body and how much I hate them both.
Side note- my mum knows how much pain I go through especially when binging and I&amp;#39;ve seen her take joy in it, joy in my weight yoyoing my dad is similar and it breaks my heart. These yoyo periods are damaging my bones, heart and making me suicidal and they seem to find it amusing.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"TW: mentions of weight gain/relapse and restrictive behavior 

The outpatient clinic I go to have been closed since it’s summer vacation. I usually get weighted once a week by my therapist, and it’s always the same scale that is being used. I’ve been getting weighed every week since late fall last year. And I’ve been in and out of recovery. 

However, I’ve relapsed quite badly now. I decided to weigh myself on monday and today. And in just under two weeks, I’ve gained almost 9 lbs. This has sent me into full panic-mode, because I don’t realize why I’ve gained that amount of weight in a short period of time. I wasn’t even underweight two weeks ago, which makes the  weight gain so much harder to deal with. Also, for the past two weeks I haven’t been eating according to my meal plan, and I’ve been walking 10-15k steps every day. That’s why I don’t understand how I’ve gained so much weight.

I have thrown out almost every single item of food from my freezer, refrigerator and cupboards, and I’ve decided to eat as little as possible until the outpatient facility opens again. Hopefully I’ll get some weight of before I’m seeing my therapist again. I fear that I won’t be able to lose any weight, and that I’m just going to continue gaining and gaining no matter what. 

I don’t believe that this relapse is going to make me lose a lot of weight, and I certainly don’t believe that I’ll be able to become underweight again. But how do I prevent myself from getting to that stage when I’m already so determined to lose the weight I’ve gained?

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I'm just not comfortable with it. Every time they ask me questions they end up saying something extremely triggering or borderline offensive and it becomes a literal job or a task to communicate regarding my Ed.

They also then said that ""every time I try to ask you stuff you just push me away"" and it's like...yeah I do that because I don't wanna hear ""why don't you just stop starving it's not good for you"" for the millionth time

It's exhausting having to communicate and it's even more tiring when they get mad at me for not opening up.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"5-6 years ago I was around 13 I was depressed and completely lost my appetite. I was already small and lost a lot of weight making me severely underweight. I was put on a medication to help my appetite and was told to essentially double what my food intake. But my appetite was low and I ate what my body told me to, so I was nauseous eating more and sometimes vomited. 

Still today if I think about food that doesn’t intrigue I get nauseous. If I eat too much I get nauseous. If I haven’t eaten I feel nauseous.

Recently I’ve lost my appetite and I’ve had trouble regaining it when I feel sick and sometimes even throw up around eating. Now I’m slowly losing weight.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I know that’s the twistedness of this disorder, but what in the world… It’s ACTUALLY getting harder to eat (even when I know I’d still be in a big deficit if I ate more, it just never feels “worth it”), and I say actually in all caps because usually it’s more of an “effort” to restrict if that makes sense? Like of course normally I ALWAYS would love to eat more or even binge bc I’m hungry duh but then thinking about the dread and anxiety of the aftermath makes me not do it, but lately the thought of eating more is ONLY and immediately terrifying and full of dread that it kills the urge altogether. There was a part of my brain that was afraid that I felt myself getting worse not long ago, but now that part is getting quieter. I feel like I should be terrified of where I’ve gotten to and where i’m headed but… it feels good and my constant lightheadedness/disassociation numbs out some of my INTENSE ass social anxiety and anxiety of being perceived at all, and it even feels euphoric at times.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I'm freaking out.

Hating full blown recovery so trying harm reduction.

Been managing to stick to a limit I still detest but is higher than when I'm fully restricting and giving in to the voice. 

Got super hungry this afternoon and could not work or focus on anything. 

Spent ages on Deliveroo on various pages adding things to basket I knew I'd never order - pizza, etc - finally settled on two protein bars.

I'm now way over my daily limit and I'll be having dinner too (otherwise the night time reactive hunger just causes such massive binges it's not worth trying to skip dinner)

I'm trying to reassure myself with the whole, protein is harder to digest, uses more energy etc...

Is that... Is that really a thing? Or diet culture bullshit?

Man I am struggling and feel so greedy and disgusting.

I keep thinking I should've just had fruits or veggies but it wouldn't fill me up. All those classic diet culture things of 'fill up on veggies to curb hunger!' just... Don't work for me after five years of anorexia.

It all feels worse cause I'm not doing any exercise at the moment due to some other health issues and exercise always helped me feel more justified in eating so now I just feel like a disgusting greedy horrible person and I know I'll gain more weight if I carry on like this.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi all! This is the first time I’ve ever posted in this sub in the hopes that maybe some others have had similar experiences.

I’ve been physically recovered from anorexia for about 8-9 years now, but I’ve pretty much always had GI issues following my recovery. At first I thought it was just a normal response to my body trying to function normally again after the damage I had done to it, but I’ve continued to have pretty severe bouts of GI problems even now when I’ve been physically healthy for an extended period of time.

Mainly I’m constantly gassy after eating (burping A LOT after every meal, pretty severe bloating) and I’ve had a consistent problem with constipation regardless of my diet/exercise levels. Recently I’ve been going 10-12 days without having a bowel movement which is obviously EXTREMELY uncomfortable and the only thing that really helps is laxatives at that point, which I hate taking because of how rough they are on your stomach.

This is the first time I’ve ever posted in this sub in the hopes that maybe some others have had similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been physically recovered from anorexia for about 8-9 years now, but I’ve pretty much always had GI issues following my recovery. At first I thought it was just a normal response to my body trying to function normally again after the damage I had done to it, but I’ve continued to have pretty severe bouts of GI problems even now when I’ve been physically healthy for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly I’m constantly gassy after eating (burping A LOT after every meal, pretty severe bloating) and I’ve had a consistent problem with constipation regardless of my diet/exercise levels. Recently I’ve been going 10-12 days without having a bowel movement which is obviously EXTREMELY uncomfortable and the only thing that really helps is laxatives at that point, which I hate taking because of how rough they are on your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to primary care doctor and my labs have come back normal (no issues with my thyroid is what they were mainly considering) and I still have no answers. Since I’ve been dealing with these issues for so long I’m kind of used to it but at the same time, if it’s something I can fix, I would love to be able to live more comfortably.

Do you have the same experience with this and if yes what helped you?
Is this due to the restriction that I’m not eating enough during the day?

I have a good friend who used to be very overweight and unhealthy. Smoked and drank every day, never exercised, ate almost exclusively fastfood. I just saw in the rules I can't post weights but he was very heavy.
One day he decided this was not the life he wanted and started to get his live around. Stopped smoking, barely drank any alcohol. Walked about (many) kilometers every day for a year and about a year later started running. Very strict dietary intake.  Lost a great amount of weight, but it did come with a few downsides. He’s very focused on keeping control of everything in his life. He often cancels social events last minutes because they can cost him a lot of energy. When he does go they can tire him out for a week straight. 
Recently he told his girlfriend (who’s very supportive) that ‘if we keep this up for another year we’ll be slim finally!’ The thing is, he already lost like  XX kg in the last two years. He is slim. 
This and his extreme control of his dietary intake has led me to believe he might be or become anorexic. I find it hard to tell if I’m maybe overreacting but I do think his view on his body is a distorted perception of weight.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hey guys. I was talking to a friend of mine recently who told me they had anorexia. They seemed fairly open about it, and when I asked them if they were interested in treatment, they said they couldn't get it because they are a young teenager and their mother doesn't support them getting therapy, and calls it a 'diet'. 

I asked them if they wanted encouragement or support, and they said yes. I've told them that they can talk to me anytime. At this point, is there anything I should do? 

Should I ask/remind them to eat, or would that put pressure on them? What are things I can say to them, not just when they come to me to vent, but even when they don't text me first, because I'm kind of worried that they won't talk to me about it as often as they want to.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"
I had stopped seeing her for almost three months due to my relapse and I told her yesterday that I could no longer in good conscience continue seeing her while deliberately hiding my relapse.

But it became too much. The weight was too heavy to carry on my own. But I didn’t want to burden anyone with it, especially because right now, I have no intention of recovering. I hid it from everyone. My husband finally said something after my mother reached out to him and he admitted he noticed how much weight I had lost and wasn’t sure how to approach the subject because we all know how complex EDs are. They have copious triggers, which must be approached very delicately. And I do know it’s exhausting for people to know what to say and how to say it.

My husband expressed his concern and he expressed concern on behalf of my mother. So I made an appointment with my therapist. No more secrets. Yesterday, I said to her, *WHY* is this all happening now? Like, all of these things from my past, why can’t I just get over it? Because outwardly, things in my life have never been better (and it’s true). So WHY can’t my stupid messed up mind catch up with me? 

And she said that’s exactly it. She said, “You have been through so much trauma and there are so many complex layers and you have just been moving through it. Surviving. You never had time to pause. But now you have stability in your life. You have a stable job after years of instability. You are in a stable relationship and now married after years of abuse and unloving partners. And even your relationship with your family is much better now. So now you have time to pause. You can start to digest.”

And she said that it is just too much for me to pause and allow the feelings to come up that have been building over decades and I just can’t allow myself to feel all of this pain and digest everything. So I fall back onto my ED as a means to cope. 

And it really shook me to my core. Like, it really does all make sense now. 

I am not ready to recover yet. And I know like any addict—because that’s what an eating disorder is—I have to be ready to recover, but I am at least grateful I confided in her. She is a safe space. I am at least grateful I don’t have to harbor this awful secret anymore and I have someone who is qualified to help me carry it.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"french guy here excuse my english but I just wanted to write feelings down

now it's been 1 year and a half that I suffer from depression anxiety and eating disorders

depression started to get better since I transitionned (I'm a trans man) and anxiety was not that bad since I stopped going to university. 
but my eating disorder takes more and more place in my life, it's just crazy how it went from a little thing to an enormous part of my existence 

it's awful, I was beginning to feel better and this stupid thing is making both depression and anxiety come back as hard as they were before, but in a different way

my last therapist was crap and I thought I could get my life together by myself. but all of my friends, all my family, everyone thinks I'm cured. 
I can't tell them my illnesses were never actually gone, and that they are seriously coming back. I have no one to talk to, I'm beginning to lose friends cause they don't understand some of my emotions and behaviour, since I hide the fact that I'm not well. I'd rather lose them than admitting that I relapsed and disappoint them.

I booked an appointment with a new therapist next week but I seriously don't know how she could help me. all the ~10 therapists I saw were awful.

all I think about is my weight, calories and fat

I'm already too skinny and lost half the weight I had ""succesfully"" gained back months ago, I'm happy but shouldn't and I always think I should lose more

I cannot live a life like that, where all of my existence revolves around weighing every f*cking gram of vegetable I eat

But now every time i meet someone i know, all they say is that i look sick, starving, skinny and skeletony (in a ugly way). They make fun of me for not eating ( passing comments like, ‘Right, you won’t eat right?’) and they also compare me with my past self when i was chubby and a bit fat and say things like, ‘you used to be so plump and chunky’ or ‘what, are you on a diet and not eating so you could lose weight?’. These comments just hurt and trigger me so badly. I get so angry but all I could do is just put on a smile and not say anything.

I had a job where i was almost not home for 1 year and when i came back i sensed that she might have problems eating and finally she admitted that she suffers from anorexia. My sister has bulimia so i know a little bit how to handle it. But i was also very afraid, because i know that anorexia is very dictating and i made the experience that to defend themselfes they are sometimes very mean to you. My ex gf suffered bad depressions for ca half a year when i worked outside and when i came back until now. after i came back and i tried everything to help her. Leaving her privatesspace if she needs or be there for here. I talked a lot with her when she was able to open herself she had so much insights. But all this openess would go away after a frw days....then depression kicks in again and ""everything is my fault"" and im ""the asshole that doesnt treats her right""....shes a little princess too...and that was always okay for me....but for example she never cleaned the flat....but when i talked with her about this she becomes angry and its not possible to talk about the subject because it becomes personal very quick, she also beat me a few times. First time she beat me i tried to calm her down without effect....and them i had to nail here on the ground because she wouldnt stop....i didnt beat back or anything i just took her to the ground so she cant beat me anymore. After that she said she couldnt trust me anymore because i nailed her to the ground and that she saw something in my eyes that shes afraid of now that i could harm her. I know that she knows thats bs...and after a few days all of this was forgotten. When i wanted to talk to her about the incidence she again said its all my fault and then she gets personal and then the talk is over.....After a long time trying, i couldnt talk to her like before when it comes to for example cleaning. My voice became more stressed and demanding and all this made it worse. But i tried it a long time diplomatic, talk normal to her and i just cleaned then. These are all just a few examples ive been together with her for 2,5 years now......and i managed to get her in a clinic 2 weeks ago week. Its where she goes during the day and comes back in the evening. Last week she just broke up with me because we had an argument and then she said ""that its my fault that shes not feeling good and that she has no energy for this"". She moved out the next day and cancelled our flat. Shes ignoring my messages and if she answers she just says thats shes done and that she doesnt wants to be together with me anymore. Her mother and sister has borderline and she acts kinda like them right now. In their family its always the fault of the other. They are very rich and she barely ever said thank you or sorry for anything. Like there are not much insights of her own behaviour.


Why am i writing this here? I thought maybe you can help me to understand her. I leave her alone and dont message her anymore...i would move on if she wants it, but if she just needs time id give her the time. I feeld bad for her too and i want her to become healthy and happy....and if i cant help her with this im the wrong person....but fo you think there are any chances that she will come back? Do you think its just a phase? Im not sure if i can handle all this anymore as well and maybe its better now how it is....but i love her. When she has her open phase shes just adorable and lovely with so much empathy....but then its gone after a short amount a time. 

I hope that i didnt offend anybody here and i hope you dont think im just an idiot that doesnt try to understand anorexia. Thats why im writing here. To understand.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hello everybody :-) firstly, I just wanted to say, I am so, so thankful that I've found this community &lt;3 I've been reading all your posts/responses, particularly around intuitive eating and extreme hunger in recovery, and it's made me feel less lonely and guilty in this crazy ol' recovery journey, so thank you so much :'-).
 I have finally ACTUALLY committed to the all-in recovery approach the last week, and I know it's the right thing approach for me to get my life back, and don't know if this is a little weird but when I wake up I often feel excited about what snacks/meals/takeaways I can try that day, as I am naturally a huge foodie!
I know my anorexia got its claws into me because I have always compared myself to others and never felt good enough; and I have always been known for being a foodie and having a 'big appetite'; I'd be the friend who went for a second dessert or was always snacking :-P but over time I felt a lot of shame around that when people made jokes about it, even though I've never been classified as 'overweight' (even though I think BMIs are a load of balls lol). 
So now I'm experiencing the extreme hunger every day, the comparison to my boyfriend/friends/lots of people on social media makes me feel so ashamed. I honestly lose track of how much I eat, from boxes of cereal to whole batches of brownies to jars of my true love, nutella (always the carbs and sugar lol). I start to really worry that I'll never be able to stop and I'll go too far the other way, and I know the more I restore weight, the more people will think I'm healed when I feel I have so far to go mentally! It is so hard to practice self-care and resting too - feel sooo lazy, but I know I can't compromise with excefcise like I always used to. I jusr don't understand how I can eat sooo much, nap and then wake up hungry again! Thank god for Disney Plus! I was standing in the kitchen eating through the entirety of Moana haha.
 I also feel like I shouldn't even be experiencing EH, as I've only been battling with my anorexia for about 18 months, and I know so many have been fighting it for such a large part of their lives :-( I'm sorry if you have.
 My question really is, is anybody else experiencing/pr has experienced any of these things?
Whoops I'm so sorry, this wasn't meant to be such a long rant! :-P Could talk about it for hours haha, learning so much each day.
I hope you are all doing OK &lt;3 I am so proud of you all on your own recovery journeys.

I start to really worry that I&amp;#39;ll never be able to stop and I&amp;#39;ll go too far the other way, and I know the more I restore weight, the more people will think I&amp;#39;m healed when I feel I have so far to go mentally! It is so hard to practice self-care and resting too - feel sooo lazy, but I know I can&amp;#39;t compromise with excefcise like I always used to. I jusr don&amp;#39;t understand how I can eat sooo much, nap and then wake up hungry again! Thank god for Disney Plus! I was standing in the kitchen eating through the entirety of Moana haha.
 I also feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t even be experiencing EH, as I&amp;#39;ve only been battling with my anorexia for about 18 months, and I know so many have been fighting it for such a large part of their lives :-( I&amp;#39;m sorry if you have.
 My question really is, is anybody else experiencing/pr has experienced any of these things?
Whoops I&amp;#39;m so sorry, this wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be such a long rant! :-P Could talk about it for hours haha, learning so much each day.
I hope you are all doing OK &amp;lt;3 I am so proud of you all on your own recovery journeys. Trying to learn that everybody will have differences in this complicated illness, and their own individual needs - but we are all in this together! Thank you so much for reading, here if anybody else ever wants to chat &amp;lt;3 Jess xxx&lt;/p&gt;

I should be appreciative I have someone to vent to and someone that will listen to me and that loves me and wants to help me right???

I can't deal with it. I feel like I'm stressing them out and being a burden to them. They are watching my eating and they expect me to eat at least 3 meals a day but they don't understand I just can't. I literally ate breakfast and lunch today and feel so fucking sick because of it. I feel like I'm going backwards. I was losing weight and now I feel like I don't have any control or choice and I'm just going to get fatter.

My parents are away for the week which literally gives me no excuse to eat. My sister will be here for some of the time- especially on nights where there is something nice to eat- but she went to her dance class last night and is going to a party tonight. The incredible fear that I felt when I found this out- well, I burst into tears when I got home. I’ve just realised that she (or any person) gives me an excuse to eat and I physically (I know it’s ‘mentally’ but it’s just such a /powerful/ hold) can’t eat without someone eating with me. And I /want/ to eat- but I also want to lose weight- but I could lose weight with a normal, healthy diet- but that would be too slow and not painful enough- ?

I hate this so much. I wish I could just be happy with my weight.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hi, I made this account just to vent, so I might not log back in but I can’t say this to anyone.

I’ve struggled with my weight ever since November 2020 because I became depressed (my mother died after being bed bound for 6 years and I was struggling with my sexuality &amp; religion ) and started binge eating to cope with it all. It didn’t “catch up” with me until July 2021. I didn’t really do anything to slim down until I went to a vacation to NYC in December 2021, and I saw how the pictures came out. I felt disgusted by the way my body looked, it was just horrible to look at. I then started to slim down and I felt great. I was slimmer and just all around healthier. 

But I always had a feeling like it wasn’t enough, that my sister who recovered from anorexia but was still skinny , that she was just better and prettier than me. Along with other things in my life, this made me realize that I have no control over goddamn anything. I also have low self esteem so I naturally just want validation from anyone. So ever since the start of June 2022, I’ve been restricting myself. Not starving, but just making sure it’s just under a certain amount of calories, exercising every chance I can, and making sure that I’m loosing enough weight to meet my goal. 

I feel like I’m obsessing now, like food is the main factor in my life and if I look ugly than I’m fucking worthless. Half of me thinks that I’m being ridiculous but I can’t look at food anymore without think of the scale going up. Hell, part of me thinks I’m just faking because I want to suffer for no reason. I don’t know what to do; I can’t tell anyone because I’ve been put in a mental hospital before and I promised myself I will never go back there, but also I don’t want to ever put my family through another thing again. Also, I don’t want to gain weight, I’m not even underweight so it’s pointless. 

But it’s a burden to obsessively count your calories, constantly think about what low calories thing can you eat and yet also be the happy girl in the family, it’s fucking exhausting.

I can’t tell this to anyone but I need to get this out.

Half of me thinks that I’m being ridiculous but I can’t look at food anymore without think of the scale going up. Hell, part of me thinks I’m just faking because I want to suffer for no reason. I don’t know what to do; I can’t tell anyone because I’ve been put in a mental hospital before and I promised myself I will never go back there, but also I don’t want to ever put my family through another thing again. Also, I don’t want to gain weight, I’m not even underweight so it’s pointless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s a burden to obsessively count your calories, constantly think about what low calories thing can you eat and yet also be the happy girl in the family, it’s fucking exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell this to anyone but I need to get this out. Thank you for listening Reddit. - VP&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hey y’all,

Hope everyone is doing well today. 

I’m hiding in my work bathroom trying not to cry because I got on the scale today and saw my weight was up by one pound. I know it’s dramatic, but I’m terrified this one pound can turn into more and I’m trying to lose weight, not gain it. (In a healthy way but struggling with that so…) 

I’m trying to be rational with the “weight fluxuating is normal/just got on birth control and told my OBGYN not to put me on something that will make me gain weight/i’m close to my period so it’s okay” but nothing is sticking. I’m already trying to figure out how I can skirt around lunch and how I can reject dinner at a friends house tonight. So this + ARFID + new job = aaaaa.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Possible TW. 

So about a week ago (last Wednesday), i woke up really sick with the flu. I tried to work out the first day, as i thought it was just allergies but then took a few days off as the illness progressed. It honestly wiped me out so much, with body aches, dizziness, and nausea. Complete weakness, too. Like walking from my bedroom to the bathroom was draining and left me out of breath (still kind of does). I started trying to go back to the gym on Monday but have not had any improvement in my energy levels. I find myself dreading going in because i feel so weak and drained, and working out with a mask on only makes the dizziness worse. However, the idea/thought of missing any more time working out freaks me out. I'm already so upset with myself for skipping most of the weekend.

I just don't know how to get the energy back. I feel so drained. Even just light stretching and walking is difficult. And any time i have tried to go into the store to walk or move around more, I feel like i should have taken one of those motorized carts. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to gain some energy back? Not only for the gym but just to function more in general, too. Like i said, even walking to the bathroom can be so tiring right now, even though it's been a week. 

I will note that I did take two covid tests, a couple of days apart, and both were negative. so it isn't that. I still have been wearing a mask in public places just so i don't spread germs even more.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I’ve seen an influx of ‘how can I support this person/ help push them to get better’ posts, and it got me curious.

{TW because of personal experience ??}

After moving out at 18, then returning home at 20 for a brief period, I went from obese to underweight in the last six or so months before I moved back home. After about a month, my father looked at me with the most dreadful, sorrowful look in his eyes. When I asked him what was wrong, he replied ‘you’re just so skinny now. You look sick’.

It was such a wake up call. I felt like a glass mirror had been shattered, and for the first time in over six months, I really looked at myself. I had been losing hair like mad, had been having horrible horrible headaches for months, I was incredibly weak etc etc. after he said that, I looked in the mirror and truly didn’t even recognize myself. I was appalled at the shadow of a person that existed in my reflection. {although I’d obviously heard of Ed’s before, I had NEVER considered myself to be suffering from one- after much education and self-reflection, I realized I’d been struggling with disordered eating since about 3rd grade}

Anyways, after I had that stream of realizations, I restored myself to a healthy weight and began going to the gym again. I very much still struggle, but I know that, at the very least, I’ll never allow myself to get to that point again. 

And I know a lot of people will think my father was harsh, or being mean, but it truly was helpful for me.

&lt;p&gt;After moving out at 18, then returning home at 20 for a brief period, I went from obese to underweight in the last six or so months before I moved back home. After about a month, my father looked at me with the most dreadful, sorrowful look in his eyes. When I asked him what was wrong, he replied ‘you’re just so skinny now. You look sick’.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"My little sister (16) is struggling with anorexia nervosa- for the last 2/3 months she’s been in and out of hospital, and is now on antidepressants but still really struggling and waiting for a bed on an inpatient psychiatric ward. All the way through her treatment so far I’ve helped with meal times, emotional support, and being there for her, as I have a better understanding of EDs than our parents did at the start of all this. 

I (19, female) have struggled with depression, anxiety and PTSD for around 6 years now, and watching her struggling like this is really setting me back in my own recovery, because I’m struggling to make time for myself and my own self care because I’m so worried about her all the time. When I was severely ill in the past she was one of the only things that kept me going, she’s my best friend and I don’t know how to cope with not being able to help her. 

So now to my question- will she feel like I’m abandoning her if I take a step back and let my parents take charge now that they’re more educated on how to help her? I don’t want her to feel like I don’t care about her, but I’m also worried about how unwell I’m making myself by dedicating all my energy to her?

,AnorexiaNervosa,"  

When I was a baby I had black hair. A few months after my birth my hair became light brown/red. After some time my hair would become darker. At the age of 4-5 or maybe even earlier my hair was very dark brown almost black. 

I am 29 years old (male) and I have anorexia nervosa for 8 years. I wasn´t able to give my body the nutrients it needed. And I noticed a lot of weird changes in my body. I read that long term underweight can affect your genes. I am very scared about this. A few weeks ago I noticed that my hair becomes red/light brown again. My cognition also changed and I feel like I am a child again. It feels like the time again when I had some real struggles with listening to people and remembering things. I noticed that these weaknesses and issues come back the longer my underweight/anorexia nervosa lasts. Is it possible that things will become good again? Will I be able to understand irony again once I gain weight again? Will my hair become dark brown again? Is it possible that due to malnourishment my genes changed? And will my genes switch again once I gain weight and hold that weight for a long period of time? I am kinda hopeless. I don´t feel like 29. More like 80. Underweight speeds up aging. I saw a video on youtube of a dog that was treated very badly by his owners. He didn´t get food and lost a lot of weight. There was nothing left but bones and skin. He was very thin. You could see his sickness in his eyes. He looked way older than he actually was. His eyes looked like death. His new owners treated him better by giving him food and attention. He is in a good place now and reached a healthy weight. Even tho he made all this success thanks to his owners you can still see that there is a difference between him and other dogs who have not suffered like he did.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I recently reached my ugw, and the second i saw it on the scale, I didn’t have even a moment of happiness or relief because all i felt was dread. I wasn’t satisfied.

I’ve had an ED for about 5 years, at first it was an intense binge, restrict cycle, which transformed into bulimia, and in the last few months its developed into anorexia. I’m going to try and be as vague as possible ,but TW regardless for weight, but my bmi has gone from healthy to severely underweight very quickly, to the point I don’t at all recognise myself. But I hate myself anyway, so might as well be thin, right?

Well the good news i guess is that I’ve been referred for an ed assessment, which ill have in a few days, but i have a feeling inpatient will be mentioned, as it already has been to me, and I’m just terrified I’m gonna show up to the assessment and they say I have to go, i will lose my shit, deny help etc, as when I’m backed into a corner I tend to get a bit explosive, and im really scared they’ll section me. But im also trying to be as honest as possible and accept the help they offer. but i rlly rlly need it to be outpatient. Me and my BF are moving out for the first time and im so excited to start our new life together, work on myself etc, and i think being out of the family home will help, bc they put so much attention onto my ed it almost makes it worse. And i want to be healthy, have energy, warmth, true happiness. I want my eyes to smile in photos again. I don’t want my bf to have to watch me lose any more weight. I want peoples trust back. I’m so fucking exhausted living like this but i feel trapped. The idea of eating over a certain amount terrifies me and I really worry that even if i make it through the assessment and can be treated outpatient, i rlly worry the meal plan will be too much for me to handle. 

I understand right now i am not well, but i do not at all feel sick enough for ip. But i also don’t know if I’d be able to gain weight in outpatient. I’m so scared I don’t know what to do.

I promised my dad I would cook him dinner as it was fathers day, I wasn't going to worry about the cals but as I sorting of the ingredients, I felt like I HAD to check.

It was awful, I really didn't want to eat the food I was making my dad but it would've been the first meal we would've at together in a long time.

I pushed through and panicking along the way but I eventually ate it all. All I could think about though was how much dairy I just consumed, how much carbs I just consumed or how many cals I just consumed.

I then of course got 🍃 and Binged which wasn't fun.....

But today I realised that the numbers in my head have really gotten to me and has taken over every aspect of my life. I can't look at anything without thinking of the cals, I can't even look at my twins food without thinking of the cals. Its getting so bad.

So, i've been in a psychotherapy for quite some time, and it has been pretty smooth since the doctor isn't so forcing at all, and is gentle, accepts whatever disordered shit I am doing.

but i noticed something. i posted about this before but here's additional experience (and probably clearer cause i have some lil energy to type unlike when i postted the first lmao)

so here's the thing.

Him: How are you? -small talks- how was your weight?

Me: I gained x kgs (when in reality, its been around \[more\] kgs OHMYGOOOOD WHAT HAVE I DONE)

Him: Congratulations. (LMAO I AM NOT CELEBRATING) How do you feel? (FCKED UP TBH) I'm glad ur taking slow steps to achieve our session's goal. Although we are still in the underweight category. But I'm happy and proud.

Me: I still feel quite weird. btw, what will happen if I gained all the required weight for my age or the normal range of BMI but I still feel like shit? Like I still feel guilty eating, and sometimes I overeat. Can I stop the sessions?

then he just didnt answer. he kept explaining about how my emotions control this behavior, how it triggers my ED, etc.

to all those who have knowledge about the process of recovery, is it really necessary to gain the required weight first than healing my mental health firsst? I AM SO CONFUSED, I WANT TO STOP THE SESSIONS BUT IM AFRAID IT IS MY ED TALKING? i keep insisting that it does not heal my mind abt my perception of food, but when i mentioned i gained, he just feel like its a process.

I feel like I'm so invalid and disgusting. I hate myself so much and I feel like I'll never be good enough for anybody. I've lost basically all of my relationships and close friends due to my mental health.

I'm at the point where I don't even enjoy food anymore, it feels like a chore. I can't go a minute without thinking about all the numbers and BC in every mirror I see.

I know I'm skinny-average but I still feel huge. I feel like I'll never be 'skinny enough' or perfect. I don't know what to do.

I have ruined my relationship with food and its took a toll on my relationship with my family. I can't eat the same meals as them, I can't go out and eat with them and I always get angry at them for trying to help.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. I stay inside all day, I rarely leave my room, I have no friends, no life, no feelings of happiness and I even took up smoking to suppress the hunger. My life is an absolute mess. it's like I'm going off the deep end and don't know how to stop.

My health has started to take a toll and I've been feeling so sick because of my illness. I don't understand why people glamorise EDs when this is the outcome, it's not fun and honestly scary.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Dear lovely people,
I recently posted a vent where I stated to probably break up the relationship to the mother of my child. After a week of fighting I suddenly found peace and didn't blame her for anything. This is not her, this is her dark friend. And I figured that I have to look for myself and cannot change her. 

As we started dating, she was fine and we had great talks, emotions and a deep relationship. I even still consider her as my soulmate. We do not live together, but actually there was the plan to move together after long 3 years of relationship. We even don't live in the same city. So my plan for now is to move there, but I will take my own flat.

Yesterday I told her in a long (respectful/lovely/friendly) text message how I feel, that I don't blame her and that I am just tired now. And I stated, that I will visit her next week for a talk (will be a break up talk). So she knows already what is about to happen/has already happened. She is calm and understands my pov.

I do still love her, but beeing with her is just too painful and exhausting. It isn't her fault, she just acts, as she ever does.

Generally I am very worried about her health. She is exzessively sportive, loves to eat as less as possible and so on.

My door will always stay open for her, when she comes back from her journey.

In the planed talk next week, I want to encourage her in changing, doing therapy, consult doctors and tell her that I will give support where possible.

Do you have any advice here? How can I convince her to change? 

As a reminder we have a kid together and I maybe must start some law anforcement in order to save my little son. But this is the last thing I want to do. She is still my best friend and I love her. Best would be to ""wake her up"", gain her motivation, give her the vision of a safe family.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I (F30) relapsed two months ago. My husband is no stranger to my eating disorder. He has known about it for years. I told him early on in our relationship. 

But it has not been this bad in years and part of me is like, how can he not see it? But I am a volume eater, so eating a full bag of steamed veggies, cauliflower rice mixed with tuna or tilapia, huge salads, etc. it makes it look like I am eating far more than I actually am. And I will lie and say I have eaten when I haven’t. I think part of him might know, though or maybe is starting to figure it out. The other day he did make a comment about how I’ve been running so much and eating like a rabbit. I of course denied it and said I have been eating plenty. I have lost a considerable amount of weight, still working towards something even lower. My bones protrude far more and I know I probably do look quite thin even if I don’t see it. I look exhausted. I *am* exhausted.

But like all of my other posts suggest, I’m really struggling keeping this to myself. No one in my life knows I have relapsed and I don’t want to tell anyone because I don’t want to be forced into treatment or forced to give up my behaviors. I have been trying to focus more on harm reduction/damage control.

But restriction and over-exercising is making me irritable, exhausted but unable to sleep at night, absolutely killing my libido and personality, and I feel even more weird about being touched now or being seen naked because I don’t want my husband to make comments about if he thinks I’m getting too thin. I don’t want anyone to stop me and I want to keep going.

But how can you be married with an ED when heavily restricting and actively losing weight? Do you openly communicate about it? Do you just continue to live a lie and keep it buried?

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I’ve been having some concerning liver issues and am scheduled for an ultrasound and gastroenterologist review to rule out anything major. My GP has a history treating eating disorders, but was clear with me that what my tests have been showing are not related to simply restricting because of AN. I’ve gone off medications and while my levels are still high they’re not as bad.

I live with my parents and they’ve been really supportive throughout, but when I mentioned to them I’ve got liver issues they instantly jumped on my restricting and told me my doctor was wrong.

Today they told me they had been ‘researching’ my problems and that I’m probably eating the wrong foods (specifically carrots).

,AnorexiaNervosa,"(Sorry if I used the wrong flair btw.) Hello, whoever might be reading this. Thank you for taking your time to read this post. I feel a need to talk about my experience and ask for help, so I came here.
So, it all started in school. We had to stand on the scale, in front of the whole class, and the professor would say our weight out loud. I had been feeling fat for quite some time by then, but I wasn't doing anything about it. When I saw the weight on the scale, it felt like the whole world had just fallen apart. I didn't know what to do. A girl from my class poked me in the ribs and said, ""Haha, I'm thinner than you! You're fatter!"", which just made the whole thing worse.
This was when I started exhibiting anorexic behavior. I didn't know much about EDs back then, I just thought I was working on my body. Day by day, I was losing weight and nobody noticed anything. Or so I thought. My grandma noticed that I ""lost a lot of weight"" and that ""I'm skipping meals"". She made me step on the scale and... I couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost so much weight. I felt so happy. My grandma also commented on my weight. ""You look better now! You're nice and think, just like a model!"", she said with a smile.
That ""complement"" made me go even further. After less than a month, I lost more weight than I did in the previous three month. It was getting out of hand and I knew it.
Once again, I was forced to step on the scale. What it showed now shocked everyone. I was already very underweight. But it wasn't enough. I told myself I was fat and I would constantly look in the mirror and check my weight. Soon, my mom caught up to what was going on. By then I already read some things about EDs and anorexia nervosa, so I had a general idea of what was happening. However, her reaction was far from what I expected. Instead of supporting me and seeking help, she said that I ""better start eating, or I'm going to take away all of the things you love until you return to normal"". I was shocked. I wished I could've just fallen through the ground right there and then. I lost all hope in ever getting better. I thought I was done.
A few months had pased and I still wasn't getting better. My mom seemed to have forgotten (or rather ignored) what had happened. My mental health was getting worse, I started self-harming and I became even more asocial than I was. I tried mentioning it again, or just hinting to the fact that I maybe had an ED. But nobody cared. The same things happened again.
I'm too young to legally get help by myself in the country I live in, so I have to deal with everything alone. My friends have been forcing me to eat something recently and I'm recovering in terms of weight, even though I'm still underweight. I feel like relapsing, I feel invalid because my ED is not diagnosed and not ""severe enough"". But I feel that I need to talk to my parents so I can get help. But they keep telling me that I'm fine, I'm just ""bullsh*tting"" or they just ignore it. I don't know what to do or how to tell them that I need help without them reacting the way they usually do.

My thoughts regarding food where more about them not giving me food that either make me sick, thanks mom for never making a lactose intolerant test, or give me sensory overload.

Hi 
Somebody very important to me has battled with anorexia for a very long time and I did not know how dangerous and intense it could be in light of the other things she battles. Recently told her about my suspicions of personally starting an eating disorder with how much weight I've lost recently. I was not self diagnosing, was just sharing a thought and she had a breakdown and cried for a very long time because of how scared she is for my health now. Please can you guys tell me any ways at all that I could help her? Any way I can support her or help her for somebody who knows almost nothing about eating disorders. Should I not talk about it? Should I only talk about it when she brings it up? She is getting really good medical care since her mom is a doc, so what can I do to help her emotionally/her confidence and self esteem? What books could I read to understand this more or sites I could visit? What has helped your friends and family understand your condition more? What are some do's and dont's when trying to support somebody with a condition like this? I really want to learn and be able to support her in what little way I can, even if its just knowing to never talk about it again. 

I'm not thinking about pushing her to recover from this, just want to support in whatever decisions she makes about her body and try help her feel positive about who she is.

doc wants me to gain into normal weight. but does not require me.

here's the thing. he is extremely kind, does not force me, jokes somehow funnily and aint offensive. he offered me small steps to up my intake where i can finally reach the normal range of bmi.

but when i asked him, what if i gained BUT the thoughts and guilt is still there, what will happen? he lowkey dodged the question and just said that thoughts will go away when ive managed to gain. he does not answer when i keep asking and insisting that it ""may"" not go away. that despite being restored, i will still be in the pool of guilt. in fact, gaining few of it makes me tired and grumpy and worse.

idk. lol. feels like he's going to leave me and claim im okay when i gained just a few ones.

&lt;p&gt;here&amp;#39;s the thing. he is extremely kind, does not force me, jokes somehow funnily and aint offensive. he offered me small steps to up my intake where i can finally reach the normal range of bmi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but when i asked him, what if i gained BUT the thoughts and guilt is still there, what will happen? he lowkey dodged the question and just said that thoughts will go away when ive managed to gain. he does not answer when i keep asking and insisting that it &amp;quot;may&amp;quot; not go away. that despite being restored, i will still be in the pool of guilt. in fact, gaining few of it makes me tired and grumpy and worse.&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hey everyone!   


So about a week ago, maybe less, I admitted myself to the hospital because my electrolytes were super out of wack and as I was throwing up after every meal (non-intentionally). That's been going on for months now and because of it, I was losing a lot of weight which made my AN flare-up.

I won't name numbers, but since I've been in here I've gained A LOT of weight. My boyfriend \*has\* brought me takeout like ice cream or pastries with milkshakes and Mc Donalds fries and stuff when he visits (which is like everyday), but I couldn't gain THAT MUCH weight so quickly, could I? I'm sdtill throwing that stuff up sometimes now, but didn't the first couple days so I did process it.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on saline for the whole time other than yesterday when they took me off IV. I was getting it pumped into me 24/7 as well as Thiamine and other supplements to try to manage my electrolytes.

&amp;#x200B;

I basically went from eating basically nothing because I was getting sick after I ate, to coming here and having take-out, 3 meals a day (with the help of a dietician), and CONSTANT saline. Could the large  amount of weight gain be caused by that? I'm trying not to freak out. I don't LOOK different other than a really bloated tummy (probably because I'm actually making stool again and have so much water in my system), but my general physic has stayed pretty much the same.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a bit of edema in my legs, and my stomach is really really puffy which is not what it normally looks like.. is that water weight? Please someone reassure me that I haven't gained as much as they're telling me I've gained. (Oh and about that, they'll weigh me on a zero'd hospital bed with my clothes on..

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hey everyone I'm having the nexaplan fitted this Thursday as I need to have it before I change my drugs (epilepsy)

,AnorexiaNervosa,"Hello,

We are seeking participants over the age of 16 years who are in recovery/ recovered or remission from Anorexia Nervosa. We are seeking people who have been in recovery from the condition to take part in a qualitative study to share their experiences of recovery and how their mindset has been affected during the recovery process. This research is in collaboration with the University of Chester school of psychology and has been given full ethical approval. This study will be asking individuals personal questions relating to their recovery journey including mental health, depressive thoughts and thoughts around suicidality. Therefore, we invite only those who feel able and comfortable to disclose their experiences to take part in the study. All who identify as experiencing Anorexia Nervosa are welcome to participate. You do not need to currently have or have had a formal clinical diagnosis to participate in this study.

If you decided to participate, or seek further information on that study (e.g., how your data will be used, inclusion and what questions will be asked), please click the following link to access participant information.

The study is voluntary and should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. However, there is no time limit. Your wellbeing is important to us, so please be aware that some questions could cause distress. Only take part if you are comfortable doing so. Should you find any question triggering or feel unable to continue with the questionnaire you are under no obligation to continue and can withdraw at any point. Any information provided will be kept anonymous and treated with complete confidentially.

Many thanks

I have always had trouble with food due to growing up poor. I had snacks during the day and then one proper hot microwave meal for dinner, I've lived this way since I can remember.

Since moving in with my partner suddenly after getting kicked out, my mental health has rapidly declined and I find myself self sabotaging and punishing myself. It has become frighteningly easy to stop eating. I feel like an inconvenience and like I don't have a right to eat their food because I don't contribute to buying it.

My self destructive tendencies make it a vicious cycle where I fuck up something so I feel like shit and get angry at myself and so then I fuck shit up for myself and then I feel like shit and get angry at myself etc.

However, I’m worried that I’m going to do/say something wrong or act in a way that will make him uncomfortable. I haven’t really been in a situation like this before so I thought I’d ask for advice so I don’t risk anything.

Working from home I have a chance to mull over eating during my shift. On a good day I’ll decide to have a snack. A victory for recovery. (which I’m trying to claw my way towards) I’m worried that only having a moment before I leave for work to decide whether or not to eat is going to lead to not eating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have tips on eating when you work in an office?&lt;/p&gt;

,AnorexiaNervosa,"I want to want to recover. Like logically I know that I would probably be happier. I mean I can just compare my overall mood on the days I eat more to the days I eat less. When I eat more I'm generally more happy throughout the day but then cry for like half an hour while falling asleep because of all the guilt/general feelings of sadness™️ that come with eating more. When I eat less I feel more depressed all day, even if I'm happy when I step on the scale. Sometimes I still cry at night.

If I'm being really honest, I think I don't want to recover because I'm not underweight. I was underweight a few months ago, then put on a few kilos and now im losing again. I keep telling myself that I'll start eating more when I'm underweight, but i realize how realistic that sounds coming from someone with anorexia lol.

When I see recovery posts online it seems like so many people say that part of the reason they are recovering is to ""get back their social life"" and there are so many posts of people's ""recovery montages"" (idk how else to call them lol) and in all of them they are usually having fun with their friends. And like idk maybe I'd want to recover too if i had friends who cared about me. I can't help but think that I'll be miserable and lonely even if I recover bc I still won't have any friends yk. Like is it worth it if no one likes me anyway?

I think I'm feeling even more sad now bc summer break started a week ago and my classmates send me Snapchats of them going out and doing things with friends, but im just sitting alone at home. And sure, i can have fun alone too, i can spend time playing piano, guitar or reading, but I just wish someone liked me enough to invite me to their party and I wouldn't just have to see pictures afterwards of everyone having fun without me. It just hurts that no one cares enough. And then of course i start thinking that maybe it would be better if I was skinnier or that I'm clearly not good enough, so why should I bother with eating (like sort of punishing myself).

My birthday is in a few days and I'm turning 16. I won't have a party bc there's not that many people I'd like to invite anyway and I would feel pathetic inviting all the people that didn't invite me to their birthday parties. I am gonna be baking a blueberry lemon cake (with 3 layers guys!!) for my birthday bc i love baking! I hope i can have a bit without feeling guilty about it. Im gonna go to a cafe with my parents and were going to a fun even afterwards that I'm looking forward too.

Im gonna go to a cafe with my parents and were going to a fun even afterwards that I&amp;#39;m looking forward too. So my birthday is not gonna be awful, I just wish that I could celebrate it for real with actual friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;m oversharing but i just needed to tell someone all this stuff bc I can&amp;#39;t say it to anyone in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had an ED for a large amount of time by now, so long that I do not remember what it is like without one. 
I struggle with alternating long and painful episodes of binging and restriction, am currently in a restriction episode.

 
I am not ready to recover yet but would like a way to sustain my mental and physical wellbeing that doesn't involve constantly obsessing over what I'm going to or have eaten. 


I have had an NG tube while in hospital, so I am not new to this. My treatment team, however, says NG tubes are for those in IP and I have made the decision that I can not go back as it was a traumatic experience for me personally to be there. 

Does anyone have experience with using an NG tube at home?

,AnorexiaNervosa,"For a while I 'snacked' on Gaviscon tablets, broke that habit a while ago but feeling like I need something to replace that habit while I'm recovering that isn't harmful, but will not send my ED brain wild losing its shit... (which it already is because recovery lol)

I'm also vegan which makes this a bit harder but I just got a box of these 'Mintastic' mints and I think they'll be great, they taste good esp. the sweet strawberry flavour. 

The polyol sweetener they use tends to make me gassy so I know I can't go overboard but I feel happy I've found something with a bit of crunch and flavour that I can nibble on throughout the day, that isn't a fucking Gaviscon tablet lol. 

I'm on a harm reduction recovery journey at the moment, I've upped my intake like 2x (!!!!! and I was never a low restrictor) and reducing my exercise by basically 100% (!!!!!) so it's ***really*** difficult and my ED brain is going nuts *constantly* and I'm just trying not to overload myself with challenges basically (I mean, eating 6x a day is already doing that lol)

so I guess finding something that feels safe feels reassuring, but there's a part of me that's like 'well it's not REALLY recovery is it because you should be having like chocolate bars constantly not little mints' *BUT then* I think hey, I'm pushing so far through my comfort zone already and that's very distressing (but also rewarding! yay for being to focus for more than one minute on my work) so maybe it's okay to do some of these harm reduction focussed things alongside the harder recovery work? 

It's not a black and white matter, recovery, I think it's a grey area and that's really hard for my AN brain to understand...

SO YEAH I'm not sure what I'm trying to say here - perhaps trying to reassure myself (and anyone else trying to recover) that *not every little snack or action you have or do needs to be some epic huge momentous challenge -* if you're already making big strides challenging your ED in recovery then it's completely OK to have some 'safe' things still in rotation, and if that stops you doing something unsafe (e.g. eating a medicine tablet smfh at my old self) then, all the better!

I feel like I’m faking my disorder, or even worse, that I have BED. I just wish I wasn’t tormented by thoughts of food all day and that I had more self control. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;

But the truth is I don't want to recover and only get worse as my mind makes me believe that this is what I deserve or that it's good for me.

Ever since I started eating more I am terrified of gaining weight or looking bigger even more than before.

This exact plan is what's keeping me on track with recover most of the time knowing that I will be able to go back to all the bad habits later on without worrying people. Ik this is unhealthy but it's the only thing keeping me going at the moment both with recovery and everyday life.

 I'm not to sure what to do as I can't tell anyone about this or my struggles with eating at the moment. The urge to relapse is getting stronger each day and knowing how precious relapses turned out for me this time it might lead me to a hospital or dead.

I'm not anorexic but I feel like I'm starting a pattern of unhealthy behavior with my eating and I would like some advice. 

I've gained weight over the past year or so  and I am so obsessed with it that Iook in the mirror constantly, I have recently began cutting out food (like I won't eat until dinner and even then I only eat like half of what I should) and when I do eat more I purge or lately I have been taking laxatives everyday to feel that ""light"" feeling. I've been hiding this behavior from my boyfriend of 2 years (who loves me but because I'm overweight I fear will no longer find me attractive). He asks me if I've eaten and I lie and say I have. A couple days ago I ate a sandwich for lunch and immediately felt guilty and threw it back up. Now I'm punishing myself because I ate a larger meal last night so I won't be eating anything for the next few days. I weigh myself everyday. 

I just want to know if this is something anyone else here has experience or what started their ED?

Instead, they are always picking on me for what they believe to be a weird obsession with healthy eating. They joke about how I will always get a salad when we order take out or how they “know I won’t eat that” when there is a food I am afraid of. 
I don’t expect or even want them to encourage my eating disorder. But I don’t want to be treated like I’m weird because in all honesty I find my fear of food to be embarrassing as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I have decided to start recovering from starving myself and disordered eating (haven't been diagnosed with an ed but i wouldn't be surprised if I had one).  I didn't want to worry my girlfriend or my mother. They kept telling me how worried they are that im getting worse and ill end up in a hospital or dead if I wont stop starving myself. 

I've been eating more than I used to for the past 2 weeks feeling guilty everyday. Now that I look at myself I feel like everyone was over reacting with my situation and that I wasn't bad at all and could keep going as I did which made the urge to start restricting again bigger.

 I don't like the fact that I feel hungry so often or that I'm not sick after a small meal. It just feels wrong to enjoy food or to actually let myself eat. And the fact that the guilt that I get after eating is getting smaller makes me feel like a failure and made me very sensitive (easily upset). This has lead to me either wanting to over exercise but I'm unable to do so as I'm always tired no matter what I do or how long I sleep. It also made me consider sh (which I tried just a few times) multiple times a day to replace the emptiness and pain I felt when starving. 

I feel like restricting myself again would make everything easier and make me happier and stop the sh thoughts. Just this time to be more secretive about it so the ones that care about me won't be worried anymore.

And the fact that the guilt that I get after eating is getting smaller makes me feel like a failure and made me very sensitive (easily upset). This has lead to me either wanting to over exercise but I&amp;#39;m unable to do so as I&amp;#39;m always tired no matter what I do or how long I sleep. It also made me consider sh (which I tried just a few times) multiple times a day to replace the emptiness and pain I felt when starving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like restricting myself again would make everything easier and make me happier and stop the sh thoughts. Just this time to be more secretive about it so the ones that care about me won&amp;#39;t be worried anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do when I want both to recover and to get worse but I&amp;#39;m scared of gaining weight and don&amp;#39;t want to worry anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how much I stare at myself in the mirror, no matter what my family says, no matter what my friends say; I'll always be fat.

I want it again so people bully me for being too thin. I'd rather die than be fat. I want to starve again, but my family forces me to eat. Now I can't stop. I hate the full feeling in my stomach. I just want it to be empty. 

I'm just going to give up and not eat. No matter how good food looks, I may just eat one meal, maybe even none. I'm so sick of the pain of being fat.

If anyone has any recovery tips or information that I may need to know or maybe something that no one seems to mention it would help me alot and maybe a few others who read this post. 

Also if anyone could explain what weight gain after restricting for a long time might look like would help too. Any even especially the discouraging from recovery facts are welcome as they'll help calm me down and not relapse once again.

,AnorexiaNervosa,"(Tw: ED behaviour)

Yesterday was really really difficult. I spiralled, my behaviour was horrendous, my mind was so lost, and I found myself in the phone to an ED helpline (in tears, having purged for the 3rd time that day) during what must’ve been the sunniest &amp; most beautiful evening there’s been in weeks. The volunteer calmed me down, listened, was kind and genuinely cared for my well-being. 

When you find yourself in a pit of despair, self loathing, feeling helpless, and speaking to a stranger instead of letting a loved one know (1) you have an ED that (2) you can no longer face alone ….. THIS IS A SIGN TO ACTIVELY DIVE HEADFIRST INTO RECOVERY. Doing it by yourself is horrendous. I’ve tried for four years and only failed.

Hey all, first time posting on here not really sure what I’m seeking whether it’s advice or to find comfort with what I’m dealing with but here it goes,

For context about 3 years ago I was a 16 year old female weighing in about normal for my age but I was already pretty small but of course I had the chubby little stomach and baby face that I couldn’t get rid of.

During this time I was in a pretty toxic relationship which left me wounded emotionally. I had lost all my self worth and felt like I had deserved nothing. not gonna lie, I was heartbroken and depressed and all I wanted to do was forget about him by being with other people. This made me want to start taking more effort into my appearance and noticed one day how small my waist was and I would be satisfied but if there was a day where I was bloated I thought “I need to be skinnier” and would start restricting by cutting out meals and not even eating during the small period of time I was able to catch a break at work , mind you I worked at a restaurant and anybody that works at a restaurant knows that you can never catch a break on a busy night. I was also at the time smoking a lot of weed and picked up vaping which I had heard can curb your appetite. 

This overtime took a toll on me. I would wake up in so much pain, depressed and unable to get out of bed unless it was to go to work. I wouldn’t even drink water but I lived off my vape, redbulls, and weed. Whenever I did try to eat I could barely stand to even chew the food, I lost a lot of weight during this time and the more I looked in the mirror I saw how much smaller I had gotten and other people noticed too. It made me feel good like I had accomplished something.i would barely leave my room. This was in summer of 2021

After the summer, I had gotten back with the toxic ex because of how shitty I was feeling, I felt like I had nobody to confide in about it, I will never forget the first thing he told me when he saw me was “you lost a lot of weight” word I’ll never forget because of how much it fueled me. Since this time we worked are shit out but I still had my own issues with eating I’ve lost a conserving amount of weight. I’m always cold, I feel like I don’t remember anything,I am at my lowest all I want to do is restrict and I just feel so guilty eating. When I do eat I never finish my food and I feel very uncomfortable eating in front of others especially friends who sometimes will make me eat something when they notice I haven’t ate (which is very fucking triggering).I feel like the relationship really fucked me up in terms of how I feel about myself and I just don’t know what to do anymore.
