,bulimia,"Bulimia is a mental disorder. Bulimia wires your brain to get stuck in an endless cycle. You are chained by it. A prisoner. A prisoner to your brain, the routine, the crutch, the reward system, the very wiring of your brain you've trained yourself to be entrenched in. The only CURE is to rewire your brain. You have to MAKE yourself not purge. You have to break the cycle. You overeat. You stop eating. You don't purge. You wallow and despair in the awful feeling it triggers to deny yourself the relief, to resist the urge. Now you must do it a dozen, one hundred, one thousand times. It gets easier the more you do it, the more discomfort you face. The discomfort magically melts away with time. I used manifestation to help me resist the urges and bad thoughts, to help rewire my brain. It does take self-control, it does take WORK but we are limitless beings and you can truly accomplish it. Anyone can. The law of assumption is what I used specifically. Because it is essentially deluding/tricking your brain, it helps you rewire it with much more ease, much more complacency. Here is a passage to sum up law of assumption:   
""**Daring To Assume That All Things Are Possible To Imagine, Put This One Reality To The Extreme Test By Assuming You Are The Person You Would Like To Be. Your Reasonable Mind And Outer Senses May Deny It; But I Promise You: If You Will Persist, You Will Receive Your Assumption.""**  


Persist in your assumption that you are recovered, that you do not have those urges. That you never want to binge or purge again. If you mess up, do it again, test yourself if you can go longer and longer without purging. Live in the delusion, in the assumption you are cured, and it will harden into fact. Once you go without doing it for three weeks, it becomes so much freaking easier. For me it's been over 2 months and I can honestly say I don't think I'll ever feel compelled enough to do it again, and during those 2 months I had several stressful emotional situations where in the past, I would have easily capitulated.

I was &gt;!2300 calories!&lt; deep into binge 1, pizza and mozzarella sticks in the oven, when I realised … I was going to b/p again tomorrow. And the day after that, and so on. Because it’s always just ‘one last binge’. This wasn’t going to be my last, it was just going to send me deeper and deeper into the hole. 

So I turned off the oven, took the half-cooked pizza out, and threw it all away. I know that’s wasteful, but I had nobody to give it to and I didn’t want the binge food to tempt me. 

If I had binged as planned, I’ve calculated I would’ve consumed &gt;!11550 calories!&lt;. I would’ve eaten it all as well, because I have no self control. 

I feel like this is a good first step towards recovery, even though I did still b/p today. I’ve never managed to stop mid-binge. Hopefully I can remind myself of this next time I want to binge.",t2_jkt8o1m7,False,,0,False,Stopped mid-binge,"[{'a': ':snoo_hug:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/wqivmcpjaezz_t5_3nqvj/snoo_hug'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Recovery '}, {'a': ':table:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/cbl32coz9ezz_t5_3nqvj/table'}]",r/bulimia,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_wlq82d,False,dark,0.96,,public,17,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},:snoo_hug: Recovery :table:,False,17,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1660221009.0,richtext,0,,,text,self.bulimia,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night I decided that I really need to stop b/p because it’s going way too far.

,bulimia,"What should I do?

Background information: I’m 15F and last year I suffered from anorexia. Idk if this is what is affecting me but I have been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and OCD. My depression has got much better over this past year. When I was a kid, I have this memory that sticks in my head of my dad coming into my room grabbing my stomach(not in a forceful way) and saying I was a pig. Sometimes he calls me fat or when I stress eat, he says “oh, you’re going to eat all of THAT?” And I think since I have adhd, all of this stuff resonates inside my head, like every time I walk past him it’s all I can think about. However, to most people Im not considered overweight, and always have been under the average weight for my age and height, but I would think about it so much that I would hate myself every time I look in the mirror and be disgusted when myself when I did eat. My mom says that my dad was overweight when he was a kid, and his parents did the same thing to him and that he doesn’t know any better. My dad really cares for me and I know he doesn’t mean to do it and that he’s still working on himself, but Im still extremely insecure about myself. 

Last year, It was to the point where I would just not eat and sometimes I would faint, and I almost cracked my skull open because I fainted fell on the floor head first (which hurt for like a few mins but I’m very grateful to not have needed to have gone to the hospital). I feel like I’m relapsing. Sometimes I feel extremely insecure and I’m absolutely terrified of ever reaching 120 pounds (I’m 5’5) and about 110 right now. I have no idea on what to do, any advice?

i also didn’t know he continued after that but around high school/college, i learned that he kept doing it “every now and again.” and it’s gotten worse throughout the years (we’re in our 20s now) but now it’s at its worst. 

he’s extremely thin, probably the thinnest i’ve ever seen him. and we still live together so i often hear him purging. i don’t want to make this about me but my heart shatters every time i see and hear him. he comes to me often crying and telling me how he feels but i know that i can’t do much to make things change for him. 

he just started medication and he has had a therapist for a while but it doesn’t seem like much has helped. i think a big part of it is that he fears being judged by his therapist for being male and struggling with this so he doesn’t open up often.

,bulimia,"Hey all! I've been recovered from bulimia for about 2 years now.  I still unfortunately overeat and overindulge a little too often, so I'm currently at the edge of being obese. I thought I could get to a point where I didn't hate this body... but it hasn't happened yet. I'm still disgusted.

What's making it worse, I have been seeing a lot of fatphobic posts and comments on social media a lot recently. Honestly, just seeing how heavier people are looked down on is so disheartening. Like it makes me want to give up. 

I really don't want to go back to the ED, but I do want to diet pretty badly. Like I am obese, I feel I should do SOMETHING about it. I do have a Nutritionist, but I'm not really following a meal plan strictly. Trying to be mindful. I'm sure some snack servings are on the larger side. Overall though, I'm not binging. Not purging. Not restricting. It's so frustrating, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I don't want to be this size forever. Should I diet somehow? If I do diet, I'm so afraid I'm going to relapse.

Cherry on top, my fiance wants me to start exercising (for health only). I struggle with other mental illness that results in severe fatigue. Ultimately, day to day, I don't have the time or energy to bust out an hour workout. And honestly, I'm just so unmotivated. His prodding really makes me feel so guilty. I do want to work out in a normal healthy way, but I honestly don't know what to do or how to get myself started. He keeps recommending I go on walks, but I live in not the best of neighborhoods so I don't want to do that.  Too poor to afford a gym near me.

I&amp;#39;ve been recovered from bulimia for about 2 years now.  I still unfortunately overeat and overindulge a little too often, so I&amp;#39;m currently at the edge of being obese. I thought I could get to a point where I didn&amp;#39;t hate this body... but it hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet. I&amp;#39;m still disgusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s making it worse, I have been seeing a lot of fatphobic posts and comments on social media a lot recently. Honestly, just seeing how heavier people are looked down on is so disheartening. Like it makes me want to give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to go back to the ED, but I do want to diet pretty badly. Like I am obese, I feel I should do SOMETHING about it. I do have a Nutritionist, but I&amp;#39;m not really following a meal plan strictly. Trying to be mindful. I&amp;#39;m sure some snack servings are on the larger side. Overall though, I&amp;#39;m not binging. Not purging. Not restricting. It&amp;#39;s so frustrating, I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong.  I don&amp;#39;t want to be this size forever. Should I diet somehow? If I do diet, I&amp;#39;m so afraid I&amp;#39;m going to relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherry on top, my fiance wants me to start exercising (for health only). I struggle with other mental illness that results in severe fatigue. Ultimately, day to day, I don&amp;#39;t have the time or energy to bust out an hour workout. And honestly, I&amp;#39;m just so unmotivated. His prodding really makes me feel so guilty. I do want to work out in a normal healthy way, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what to do or how to get myself started. He keeps recommending I go on walks, but I live in not the best of neighborhoods so I don&amp;#39;t want to do that.  Too poor to afford a gym near me. I was thinking yoga/pilates at home, but then it&amp;#39;s just getting the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the jumbled long text. I&amp;#39;d appreciate any advice.&lt;/p&gt;

I struggled with anorexia up until my junior year of high school. I started having a lot of family issues then and the anorexia turned into binge eating. I gained like 100 pounds in a year. I didn’t even recognize myself. But those years were nothing compared to when I first discovered purging. 

I left college halfway into my freshman year to move back home (more family issues). At the time I’d started withholding food again but I stopped for at least a year after moving back home. I had a healthy mindset about food but I was still over weight. 

I decided to start loosing weight and I remember being so good in the beginning. I was exercising regularly and eating normal portions. I lost about 20 pounds the healthy way. Then it started to take longer to lose a pound and I started getting frustrated. I wanted a faster way to get rid of this weight. So I went back to bulimia. 

It wasn’t too bad at first maybe I’d purge once a week. Then it went up a few times a week. Now I purge every day after everything I eat. I spend half the day bingeing and the other half purging. 

I’ve lost over 40 pounds in 3 months. Everyone praised me for losing the weight it feels almost like they’re encouraging my ED.  I’m constantly thinking about food. I can’t control myself around it the urge to binge is far greater than any will power I have left. Then the shame I feel afterwards and the need to purge comes along. 

I don’t go out to restaurants anymore. Friends and family ask me out and I always find an excuse. I’m in the bathroom for 20 minutes after every meal. I feel like everyone in my life must know by now even tho I try to hide it. I get so paranoid thinking they’re all talking about how disgusting I am. 

Sometimes I want to just sit with my family and eat pizza in the living room while we watch a movie. But I know I would have to excuse myself to the bathroom after eating 4 slices and hating myself for it. 

My throat is constantly sore and my teeth are now stained yellow. I’m always scared I smell like vomit. And I can’t stop.

,bulimia,"I consider my self miles better that I was say a year ago and even during that fee year period I was better than I was during my late teens to early twenties.

I feel like I've hit another plateau. After getting proper therapy, she decided to treat me as if I had  CPTSD (she's probably the only successful therapist/psychologist I had in 11 years after multiple failed attempts at CBT) and working on my diet a little bit I engage in the behaviour way less, can actually keep actual food stocks in my house. I've been at this stage for a year which has been great and a better stage than I ever imagined I would come but I know it's far from recovered.

 But I still definitely do it at least 2-5 times a week and straight up can't keep a pretty extensive list of food in my house or know once I start eating said foods I won't stop. I've tried, it just doesn't happen. It's mostly an anger/stress/distress coping mechanism.  To a very minor degree weight control although if I didn't eat such insane amounts I wouldn't feel the need to use it this way.

Ideally I'd want to utilize it as a coping mechanism less, so realistically if I ended up doing it 1/2 times a week and was able to expand the range of food I did keep in the house, enjoy and be excited about my life a bit more.

After getting proper therapy, she decided to treat me as if I had  CPTSD (she&amp;#39;s probably the only successful therapist/psychologist I had in 11 years after multiple failed attempts at CBT) and working on my diet a little bit I engage in the behaviour way less, can actually keep actual food stocks in my house. I&amp;#39;ve been at this stage for a year which has been great and a better stage than I ever imagined I would come but I know it&amp;#39;s far from recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still definitely do it at least 2-5 times a week and straight up can&amp;#39;t keep a pretty extensive list of food in my house or know once I start eating said foods I won&amp;#39;t stop. I&amp;#39;ve tried, it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen. It&amp;#39;s mostly an anger/stress/distress coping mechanism.  To a very minor degree weight control although if I didn&amp;#39;t eat such insane amounts I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel the need to use it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I&amp;#39;d want to utilize it as a coping mechanism less, so realistically if I ended up doing it 1/2 times a week and was able to expand the range of food I did keep in the house, enjoy and be excited about my life a bit more. I know cold turkey will immediately fail, I think I&amp;#39;ll turn into a nasty hysterical raging crying monster within two weeks if we take that route.&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"Sooooo hi. I began b/p when I was about 14. I was abused growing up. And always told that I fat, chubby, ugly, you name it. Well, after I was groomed and then sexually assaulted at 13, things got bad for me in my mind. At 14 I started the b/p because I was so tired of all the bullshit. At least this was something I had control over in my life. So I thought. It was controlled for the most part and I stopped when I was 16. I thought I was cured or something. Well, when I was 18, my boyfriend at the time kicked me out. This triggered it again. I got it to stop after he took me back a couple months later. When I was 20, my mom died, my husband hated me, I cheated, and we divorced. I ended up starting up again. I lost like fifty pounds I think within a two month period. I would barely eat. Then whatever I did eat I would purge it. I was very active at that time. So the weight just poured off. Well, we got back together. I got pregnant and I stopped again. Over time my depression got worse and instead of b/p I would just straight up binge. I gained all that weight back and more. I felt gross. But couldn't stop. Eventually I left him. I started up again. And stopped eating for the most part. The weight came off again. But when I got with my current husband I was okay again. Stopped, got pregnant, used that pregnancy as an excuse to binge. No exercise. Ugh it was horrible. But I got through. Since then, I've only b/p once or twice. I binge a lot still though. However, with some issues in my family, I'm starting to not eat again. I've been restricting my intake and saying I'm just fasting till dinner. I don't eat as much as I normally would. And small portions fill me. I've already lost a little weight. I guess I'm just looking for support of sorts. I'm in therapy. And I'll probably bring it up to her next time we talk as I just realized things are kicking up again. But in the meantime Idk how to stop. I feel gross. I'm a stay-at-home mom, full time college student, and I have a lot of responsibilities with three kids and husband. I think stress possibly kicked it up, if I look back at my history. But still.

,bulimia,"I'm going to a very triggering restaurant that I can't suggest a different place (birthday choice) and I can't get out of (most don't know/some don't understand why) and it's for my BIL that I just love.

My problem is mainly it's a place where you share plates and cooking methods. I've been like three times and I hate being asked what I'm getting (the menu confuses me and it's pricey so idk how expensive my share is) and I hate that other people just have to eat so much more then me on things we split for very valid reasons (high activity taller men and growing teen birthday boy)

Basically everytime I go, I'm anxious about choices, I'm anxious about getting enough to eat/too much and every single time I have gone I've b/p'd wether or not it's been a lot to eat (a few times it has been), mainly considering it a b based on the frenzy I feel. My SO always gets weird around his family, so worried about embarrassing him or myself too from those issues and just my base level anxiety.

I don't know if they help any of you, but sometimes a guided meditation at the right time can make me feel stronger and less likely to use unhealthy coping mechanism.

,bulimia,"There may have been a post like this in the past, but I can’t seem to find it. I’m trying to make a list of positive reasons to recover ~ physical, mental, emotional ~ and would love more ideas of what your top reasons to recover are. I’ve seen and made a list of all the negative consequences and side effects of bulimia, but really want to list out the pros and things that would make my life  better by recovering, too. Mine are:

1) Be able to be closer and spend more genuine time with friends and people I love - bulimia isolates and separates me from people I love with the shame and secrecy. I can be hanging out with someone and my mind will be fixated on food and B/P after I see them, or will cancel plans altogether.  

2) See and like what my face actually looks like in its natural state, without swollen glands / cheeks from purging. My face being puffy and swollen is a huge trigger to me, yet I know in order to get it to go down, I need to not purge. This feels like a significant goal for me, to see and know what my face really looks like minus purging

3) Get rid of the shakiness, dizziness, heart palpitations, and brain fog caused by bulimia. My focus, concentration, memory and mental clarity has gone downhill so much, as bulimia’s got worse over the past year and a half. I feel like my attention span and intelligence is so much lower than it was.

,bulimia,"I describe it as bulimia with orthorexic tendencies. If it's ""unhealthy"" &amp; I don't think it's worth absorbing the calories for the nutrition it provides, I purge. So an arugula salad I can keep down. But a pizza? I'll eat the whole thing, so I can't have more later, &amp; then puke it. I'm not totally sure labelling it with ""orthorexic tendencies"" is the best or most responsible descriptor but that's what I see fit for now.

It started a little over a year ago in February of 2021 when when I weighed myself and was like 208 lb. I had thrown up before maybe a couple times here &amp; there since I was about 13. But this past year is when the disorder really kicked off and it became a habitual thing that I realized was effective. At first I threw up anything without categorizing it is good or bad and deciding what I don't want to metabolize. But when my hair started thinning out, I focused a lot on nutrition and eating the right foods. So I started taking vitamins and then I let myself keep down nutrient dense meals. &amp; Id only get rid of the bad things. Over time, I started to just be repulsed by the idea of eating anything bad altogether. So I didn't have to purge as much. But as EDs tend to, it got worse &amp; around March of this year, I started to have the urge to get rid of the good foods too if I thought I was eating too many calories to still lose weight. Since then I have tried to recover but I think I fully relapsed. I gained 10 pounds while in recovery and now I'm back to purging bad foods and only taking good foods and I'm trying to restrict the calories of the good food that I take in so I can still lose. &amp; I'm slowly getting back to being disgusted by ""unhealthy"" things. &amp; Having an easier time not eating them. Which is good. But I don't want to get to a point where I feel like I need to purge the good food. The food that actually benefits my body. Which is why I'm restricting the calories of it. I now weigh about 145. In season 2 of my bulimia, I've graduated from vomiting to also using laxatives but I try to use those sparingly as to not develop a tolerance &amp; to avoid any intense electrolyte depletion. This is hell. &amp; I'm so tired. I just want to be normal. &amp; I know where this all stems from. I know why it started to begin with but I can't dismantle it now. &amp; I can't just recover &amp; let myself gain weight either. So much of my self worth has been tied to how pretty &amp; fuckable I can make myself. That's mostly a result of a physically, psychologically, &amp; sexually abusive relationship I had been in for the past two years, along with other things. I won't go into detail of what specific events caused which specific behaviors &amp; the thought process behind them. That's a lot to unpack.

I tell myself that once I hit the certain number, I can just eat to maintain. But I know that eating disorders are brutal &amp; don't work that way. I know that I'll just aim lower. I've already started to set lower goal weights before even hitting the original. &amp; If I'm being totally honest I don't see an end to this. I try to imagine what it'd be like to be okay with my body &amp; its fluctuations that are bound to come throughout life. But that sounds impossible. I don't know how I can ever balance a healthy awareness of what I put into my body &amp; my energy expenditure. &amp; I'm scared. I don't trust myself to  balance enough to not gain or not fall into disordered patterns once I do decide to recover. I'm terrified by the reality that I'm already to deep into this &amp; I will never truly be okay. I don't know how much I've actually come to terms with how utterly damaged I am. &amp; How irreparable it is. These are traumas &amp; patterns I will constantly have to manage for the rest of my life &amp; I don't want to burn out so much to the point that I reach suicidal intent. But I've been there before, before I even had the eating disorder. &amp; I can see it coming. It's just a matter of when &amp; how I can intervene before it gets to an attempt.

,bulimia,"So quick backstory, my parents abused me growing up, I coped by eating myself sick. Literally. Food was far more a comfort than a necessity. When I was small, my parents had a side by side fridge, and they padlocked it as well as the pantry, so I couldn’t wake up at 1 am and sneak food. I recall one evening in particular, one I’ll NEVER forget: I was MAYBE 10. We went to a Lion’s Club fish fry fundraiser because our landlord was in the Lions and got us tickets every time they did their quarterly fry, and I had been fighting with my parents all day. We sat at the table, and they kept coming around to top off our pieces of fish, potatoes, etc (it was AYCE) and I literally ate until my body couldn’t take it anymore, and threw it all back up, all across the table. It was mortifying, even more so because it was binge eating, something that I felt was entirely out of my control, something that they warn us against when they discuss bulimia and anorexia in health class. I never put it together until five years ago when I got help for an opiate addiction—not only was I addicted to eating, I was over 400 pounds and pre-diabetic.

Fast forward. My relationship with food has significantly changed, thanks to outpatient rehab for drugs.  The coping mechanisms are the same. Now, I eat when I’m hungry, I eat sweets if I’m craving them, I drink sodas when I want them, but I often don’t. Sugary soda is TOO sugary now. And I’m not eating an entire box of snack cakes in one go. I’m mindful of what I eat, I stopped chugging mt dew and switched to Diet Coke and liquid Death sparkling water (because I hate flat water with a fuckin passion,) AND I fast intermittently. Those THREE changes, being mindful, cutting sugar in pop and being more hydrated, as well as not eating for certain hours of the day, have been a turning point for me. I have a long way to go, and I know that even though I’ll struggle, I WILL continue to lose weight. 

However. I live with my parents; my dad is disabled and needs a live-in to get by. My dad is “concerned,” because I “eat too much,” when in actuality, a, he has no idea what I’m eating or how much unless I directly tell him, and b, he’s one to talk. He’s an insulin dependent diabetic, but I keep my mouth shut about his addiction to sweets, because it’s none of my business. Today, I had a paper plate with six strawberries and a piece of roast beef lunch meat, and an avocado in a bowl with some salt. (Bc I don’t like my foods to touch. The avocado had a weird texture so I didn’t eat more than half of it. I ate half the meat and all of the strawberries. And then I waited for half an hour. I was still hungry so I decided to make popcorn. At which BOTH of my parents piped up and my dad asked if I had ever considered keeping a food journal… Yes dad, I did that. I kinda got really irritated with him for that. He SAID it’s because he’s concerned about me, but he also has a lot of control issues, and I’m not totally convinced it has nothing to do with that.

I want to educate them about binge eating/bulimia, as well as educate them on how much better I am… but I have never really had to have this conversation.

,bulimia,"   So, to start out, I didn't always have an unhealthy relationship with food. Growing up, my mother, while abusive, was an excellent cook. Plus, growing up in a family of all big eaters, I learned to love food pretty early on. I always had a big appetite, but was one of those (like my family) who have that lovely genetic blessing that allows them to eat and eat and eat and eat and never gain an ounce. Unfortunately, I developed a condition called PCOS around the age of 12 that caused me to blow up like a literal balloon (put on 50 pounds in 2 months at 5 feet tall). Even more unfortunately, this went undiagnosed for a decade- I only recently found out about it. Mom instantly started picking on me and saying it was because how much I was eating, which started my inevitable downward spiral into eating disorders, depression, body image issues, etc. I couldn't just learn to stop loving food, with food being one of the only positive things I can associate my mom with during my childhood- so naturally I'm an extremely emotional eater. Doesn't matter what the emotion is, it makes me want to eat. Its like it's just hardwired into my brain as some kind of weird coping mechanism.

   Over the years, I packed on quite a few more pounds. It wasn't until I hit 200lb that I finally said enough is enough and started doing research about it. Weeks of research and several doctors visits later, and I finally got diagnosed with my condition. At that point, I had the tools and knowledge I needed to finally be able to lose weight. I was successful for the first 60lb- and I actually did it in a healthy way!! I started eating less processed food, working out regularly, managing portion control, etc etc. It's been working up until a couple weeks ago. Suddenly all my previous food urges came back to me and I feel like I can't control myself anymore. I tell myself ""I just ate- I'm not hungry, I'm already full."" And then my body just goes on autopilot and I eat more anyway, which of course leads to me binging and purging again for the first time this year. I was doing so good, but now I'm starting to gain the weight back again (only 5lbs so far) and I just feel such a loss of control. As a recovering alcoholic, I can confidently say that these food cravings are just as bad, if not worse, than alcohol cravings. I used to pour bottles down the sink to keep myself from it- but I've never thrown food out, or even given it away. I just can't. Its like I'm falling off the bandwagon again but this time with food instead of alcohol. 

   I guess that I just didn't realize until now that I'm going to have to fix my relationship with food if I want to lose weight and keep it off. I guess I just got so excited when I finally understood what was going on with my body that I didn't even take my food relationship into consideration until it started rearing it's ugly head again. I can do all the right things at all the right times, but eventually I'm going to squander all the results I'm seeing with my binging unless I get control of it, and since my weight was the initial cause of the eating disorder, it lands me right back in that vicious cycle of loving food and hating my body that I lost my teenage years to. So if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, I would greatly appreciate it. I don't even know where to start. Do I train myself to stop enjoying food so much? If I try to teach myself the ""just eat when you're hungry"" rule, I just end up binging and purging again. I tried googling, but only came up with the same lame, generic stuff my therapist told me. I'm sure that stuff works for some people, but it never worked for me.

Given, this is because I’ve been exercising and kiiind of restricting?? Like not really restricting but just eating “safely” but also eating little random snacks here and there. I rarely cook meals without tracking them and weighing them (because Thats what helps to keep me from wanting to purge) but for the past few days I’ve been able to kind of just eat whatever my work or family makes and estimate the cals. Also, My work really has been helping simply because they make us meals and I even look forward to being “forced” to eat what they make us. Not actually forced, but it’s made specifically for us to eat and everyone eats it so I feel okay when everyone else is, even though it’s always “comfort” foods like lasagna, alfredo, Mac and cheese, etc., but it feels freeing I guess. 

Anyway that was kind of me rambling. But I’ve been weighing myself most days and it’s remained steady so I’ve been doing a trial of what my maintenance calorie intake is based on weight fluctuations. I think I’ve figured it out for the most part, but then I randomly shot up by like 4 lbs between a few days and I freaked TF out.

This morning I said that I felt better (due to the fact that I looked reaaaally skinny), but then at the party I was eating wings and Mac and cheese, baked beans, etc., which still did not bother me, until out of nowhere my brain told me to take a plate to-go so I could binge on it a little. So I did, and then I went to the store and got some dessert. Anyway, I ate the food, and like a pint of ice cream, a taco I had leftover, and one cookie.

So, as always, i’m in my routine when my sister wants to go shopping with our then nanny (long story). she wants to go to TJ Maxx. i’m sitting on the couch while on my phone eavesdropping on the conversation and pipped up. “can i come? i need more clothes.” which was so desperately true considering i was a growing teen whose clothes always shrunk in the wash. i was living on the same two outfits for that whole summer. so, we’re getting ready to leave when i ask how long they thought this was going to take. my oblivious nanny replied “an hour, maybe two”. now, this was incredibly risky and lord knowssss i knew it too. i remember myself literally calculating how the time frame would work like “okay if i speed up my sister’s shopping by 30 min and i just grab one or two things bla blah blah” by this point in the day i was a horrid number of laxatives in. so the three of us get in the car and take the 7-10 minute drive to TJ Maxx. we pull up and i could feel my stomach lurch because of the physical movement of WALKING. i immediately knew i was in trouble because that lurch is what i felt when the laxative started to kick in. i didnt even make it to the first aisle until my stomach started it’s inner battle with my intestines. i thought it was just a really bad stomach ache. because the laxatives had never done this to me before. i looked around for a bathroom, to no avail. nothing. i told my nanny i wasn’t feeling good and was going to hang out in the car until they were done. as i was waking in the parking lot, out of NOWHERE, i could feel liquid shit trying to push its way out of me. this startled me and almost made me shit my pants, and so i froze for a moment to use all of my remaining willpower to clench the hardest i had ever clenched up until that point. i am truly amazed how i didn’t shit right then and there, i book it to the car and by this point i am sweating bullets, like full on whole body sweating trying to resist the urge to shit. i think i almost started crying. i got into the car and fidgeted for what felt like an hour to situate myself in a position where i wouldn’t immediately implode on myself. i was in a dire state of stress and anxiety and was frantic. i screamed at my phone “HEY SIRI CALL NANNY.” of course, the stupid AI didn’t know if i said if i wanted sushi or a massage. i once again screamed “SIRI CALL NANNY” “im sorry-“ “AGGHHHGGG” this was like pure agony. i opened my phone to find my nanny’s number. it was super difficult because i was shaking like a leaf. i called her and SHE DIDNT PICK UP. I was about to scream. i called her again and she picked up on about the fourth ring. now i don’t remember my exact conversation with her but i think it went something like “Nanny i’m gonna shit myself” “what?” “Nanny i’m gonna shit myself please get out here now asap now NOW” she said okay and hung up. no hi or bye. just extreme urgency. now for the wait. and oh my god. she took a total of 5 minutes aka an ETERNITY to get out to the car. when they got into the car my sister looked wildly concerned and we drove. the nearest bathroom was the Jack-in-the-Box across the street. we get to it’s parking lot and i stroll up acting as if i wasn’t holding back fucking boulders with my ass cheeks. i tried to open the door. locked. . . . im gonna die today. turns out it was closed for renovation. i sprinted back to the car. the new nearest bathroom was back at home. as we started driving i remember saying to my nanny “if i shit in your car, i’m so sorry” after 7 minutes of hell, miraculously, we made it home without my shitting myself. i ejected myself out of the car before it even stopped moving and once again made a run for my life to nearest bathroom in my home. i sat down and a wave of relief came over me, that i could kept part of my dignity. i then exploded. violently. i literally braced myself with the bathroom walls. so violent the toilet water was splashing at my bare ass. i was shitting for i think 30 minutes. but alas, no casualties, minus the toilet that had just been obliterated. i stepped out of my bathroom feeling somewhat accomplished. proud of myself and my willpower. and the immediately magnetized myself right back to that same toilet for the aftershock of the laxative.

Sorry if this seems like a dumb post, but it’s 2am when I’m writing this and I can’t sleep due to extreme hunger. Hopefully if anyone reads this and thinks EDs are cool or fun, this paints a more grim picture.

I hate my life. I am completely and utterly consumed with the food. To preface, I’m a 6’3, 125 lb (BMI of 15.6), 22 year old man diagnosed with severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Anorexia and Bulimia. 

I moved out of my parents house (more so I was kicked out because they hated my weekly B/p episodes and having to hear the constant noise of gagging, vomiting and me shitting out my guts due to lax abuse). I now live on my own in complete isolation as my entire day is planning my daily B/p routine, which has gone from once a week to now every single fucking day.

Im obsessed with the scale weight and the way I look, and if I’m not thinking about food, I’m watching calorie challenges from Eriktheelectric or other chest day channels on repeat. When I’m out trying to get my usual 23,000 steps a day, I’m listening to podcasts on bodybuilding diets and how to restrict, or sometimes I’ll listen to the podcasts on diet breaks and refeeds to give myself the false hope of someday allowing myself to not be starving.

I have an extreme fear of gaining weight and every time I come home after a long day and weigh myself only to see the number is too high for my liking, I purge all my meals to try and get that number back to even lower than it was in the morning. 

I intermittent fast for the first 6-8 hours of my day, and only eat once prior to a B/p session, which may be why I’m so hungry all the time but because I come from a childhood of obesity and poor food habits, coupled with the trauma of being bullied/mocked about my weight (even from my own family members), I cannot shake the fear of letting myself gain even a fraction of body fat.

My testosterone and iron levels are practically non-existent, and my mood is so angry I’ve essentially devolved into a complete and utter asshole. I hate everything, and want to kill myself so fucking badly but I’m too much of a goddamn coward to do it because I am afraid that being the eternal fuck-up I am I’d somehow mess it up and place myself in a situation somehow worse than the current one I’m in. I stopped taking my meds around a year ago because of the side effects of potential weight gain, and have been lying to my doctor and family members for that long. I get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night, and systematically wake up throughout due to hunger pangs.

I live in complete squalor, have stolen from grocery stores, collect coins from the side of the road and am barely able to make rent due to the bulk of my salary going towards food. The last purchase I made for myself was a $3 phone case, which I regretted because I thought that money could go to a box of cookies instead. Somehow I manage to maintain a job, but literally feel like a zombie the entire time due to weakness. I have been doing this for a year now (1 year anniversary last week), and since my parents are moving away on the 17th of august, my current plan of action is to jump off a bridge.

,bulimia,"A little background info: I'm 32 and have been diagnosed with BN since I was about 24. I am mostly in recovery, with some small slips here and there. I tend to take a harm reduction approach with my recovery and avoid trying to follow a super specific meal plan, trying to do things perfectly, etc. I lean more toward intuitive eating and that has worked out really well for me.

That said, I have struggled with eating during the day for quite a few years. It has slowly gotten better, but I still really struggle with breakfast. I used to be primarily BED and just compulsively overeating... I didn't start other behaviors until my early-mid 20s. When I first started restrictive and compensatory behaviors, I was also trying out keto type diets. That led me to intermittent fasting, and boy did I latch onto that one lol. That and low carb were my first true diet obsessions, and I engaged in those behaviors for a while before starting to purge more regularly. I was essentially binging at night and purging by fasting the next day. Eventually it got so bad that I was BPing multiple times daily. Miserable.

Fast forward to today after inpatient, therapy, meds, DBT, EMDR, nutritionists, so much therapy lol. Still doing therapy biweekly. Still on meds. I'm doing pretty well. My partner and I used to work similar hours, and we got to eat dinner together. So even if I struggled eating a bit during the day, I at least always got a really solid dinner and never purged it.

Welp, now he's working until 10pm or so, and I'm working mostly 8am shifts. I'm feeling some... habits begin to pop back up. Today I went grocery shopping and bought a lot of ready to eat stuff so I don't have to worry so much about cooking after work, and I straight up bought several safe foods as well without really thinking about it. I purged once a few nights ago and felt super gross about it. There's just so much alone time.

I mentioned my concerns to my best friend, and she said she feels confident that I won't sink back into it because I'm aware of it. We both have some form of disordered eating, hers more ARFED type stuff. We also both have bipolar 2 and anxiety. She kind of understands in a way, but the pull to lose weight isn't there for her. She's actually self conscious of how thin she is. So she doesn't quite understand that my ED is fucking insidious and wants to trick me. It wants me to be complacent and fall into old habits.

She has a point- I feel exhausted thinking about doing things the way I used to do back in my worst days. The fact that I've mentioned it in therapy, to a close friend, and am posting here says that I don't truly want to relapse. But I also am really suffering with my body image lately, and being alone more often, thus being able to micromanage my intake and skip meals, is not helping one bit.

Eh, I guess that's it really. I just.. needed to say it to people who would understand. I don't wanna relapse. I'm scared. But I feel myself sooooo ready to hide everything again and dive right back in. Stupid ass illness.

I am mostly in recovery, with some small slips here and there. I tend to take a harm reduction approach with my recovery and avoid trying to follow a super specific meal plan, trying to do things perfectly, etc. I lean more toward intuitive eating and that has worked out really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I have struggled with eating during the day for quite a few years. It has slowly gotten better, but I still really struggle with breakfast. I used to be primarily BED and just compulsively overeating... I didn&amp;#39;t start other behaviors until my early-mid 20s. When I first started restrictive and compensatory behaviors, I was also trying out keto type diets. That led me to intermittent fasting, and boy did I latch onto that one lol. That and low carb were my first true diet obsessions, and I engaged in those behaviors for a while before starting to purge more regularly. I was essentially binging at night and purging by fasting the next day. Eventually it got so bad that I was BPing multiple times daily. Miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today after inpatient, therapy, meds, DBT, EMDR, nutritionists, so much therapy lol. Still doing therapy biweekly. Still on meds. I&amp;#39;m doing pretty well. My partner and I used to work similar hours, and we got to eat dinner together. So even if I struggled eating a bit during the day, I at least always got a really solid dinner and never purged it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welp, now he&amp;#39;s working until 10pm or so, and I&amp;#39;m working mostly 8am shifts. I&amp;#39;m feeling some... habits begin to pop back up. Today I went grocery shopping and bought a lot of ready to eat stuff so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry so much about cooking after work, and I straight up bought several safe foods as well without really thinking about it. I purged once a few nights ago and felt super gross about it. There&amp;#39;s just so much alone time.&lt;/p&gt;

Now my food from the first purge is all acidic and burns really bad coming up (literally feels like battery acid 🤪😜yay!)
And for science reasons that slop comes up first. I stopped after getting maybe a quarter of what I consumed out. Not because I couldn’t continue or because i physically couldn’t do it. But because I decided just to suck it up and take the F. Now I’m here drinking hot tea with half and half and wondering what to do to get out the cals. (I allowed cream but I’m questioning on why the fckkkkk but calmly and understandingly 🙂) 

Option one and the most rational: It’s one meal it’ll balance out and to still eat regularly tomorrow to avoid the next binge. (A polite decline to this given where im at in recovery mentally 🤪 I honestly just put this here cause ik it IS an option even if I really don’t fuckin like it OMG 🫣

Option two: Fall back on lax for a day. (I like this one but then I’ll have a whole container and it being their openly available isn’t good for me so I was opting for maybe a single fiber brownie? But that idea makes me think it won’t expel everything with just one. Which will send me to binge on a whole box. (Fiber one)I honestly like this option 😐

Option three: ✨Exercise 🫥Stay up another day straight and burn off cals by running and just say fuck you to my intestines since they hurt a lot after walking briskly for 17-20mins. So I can go home earlier and get a lil sleep in before going into my night job. Or a more rational take, burn off the cals by obsessively walking them off. OBSESSIVELY walking an UNknown amount of cals. 🫥I think you see why I’m leaning towards the brownies as a person who is very sleep deprived. I guess this part is multiple smaller options like those answer choices with A. B. C. Parts? I like those personally 🫢Anywho, I could also “makeup” for today by casually (non-obsessively) burning off cals on my off days (sat-Sunday) but then I’ll restrict and not want to spend time with food related activities with friends and family :3 Honestly I feel indifferent to this one since their annoying and trigger me 🤭But that’s just for me and you to know lol

,bulimia," Hi Everyone,

By way of introduction - I'm a fourth-year Honours/ psychology student in Australia, with a personal interest in studying Eating Disorders due to how it has affected my life personally (and continues to affect it).

As part of my university degree, we are currently conducting a study to investigate how one’s self-perception relates to Eating Disorder symptoms, as well as other psychological symptoms including emotion regulation, Obsessive Compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphia symptoms, and depression.

To be eligible, you must be aged 18 years or older and fluent in English. **You do NOT** need to have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or an Eating Disorder to participate.

&lt;p&gt;By way of introduction - I&amp;#39;m a fourth-year Honours/ psychology student in Australia, with a personal interest in studying Eating Disorders due to how it has affected my life personally (and continues to affect it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my university degree, we are currently conducting a study to investigate how one’s self-perception relates to Eating Disorder symptoms, as well as other psychological symptoms including emotion regulation, Obsessive Compulsive symptoms, body dysmorphia symptoms, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be eligible, you must be aged 18 years or older and fluent in English. &lt;strong&gt;You do NOT&lt;/strong&gt; need to have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or an Eating Disorder to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"So, after my last post here in April, things went downhill pretty fast. After Easter, I binged and didn’t purge enough, which made me gain weight, 4 kgs to be exact.

After that, I contacted a therapist and have been having online appointments in a 2/3 week basis. Finally, I can say that I’ve been feeling better and today marks my 1 month binge free.

Slowly I’ve been eating “forbidden” foods and haven’t been tracking my calories or focusing on dieting as much as I used to.
However, although I do love not being constantly as obsessed with food and calories as I was, I also can’t help but feel sad and frustrated for not dieting and not losing weight. I’m scared that if I start tracking everything I eat I will relapse again.

I have been at a steady weight, but it’s still so much higher than it should be. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this feeling?

Thank you in advance and everyone out there in recovery please stay strong!

,bulimia,"I’m really trying to give it all to recover from this illness. I don’t vomit as much but I instead purge by fasting.

For 3 weeks now I have been eating at least 2000 calories a day, but i still get the same urges to binge and I act on them. They seem more emotional than psysical now but they are just as big and probably happen 1-2 times a week. I have not purged these binges in any ways but anxiety and doubt is really creeping in on me. I know that restriction is a major trigger to binging, but even if I don’t purge/restrict, I binge and I feel like I can’t keep just going back to normal the next day without gaining a ton.

Have any of you been in the same situation and experienced that you really just had to ‘suck it up’ and keep those binges inside of you for a period of time and the urges/binges will automatically decrease?

,bulimia,"I went five days without a b/p which is legitimately the longest I’ve gone in YEARS. Literal years… that is so sad. Anywho, I slipped up yesterday once and now again today I’m having major major cravings. I went into the grocery store and looked at so many things… cookies, muffins, bars, nuts, popcorn. I spent almost 30 minutes looking at all the the things I could buy and maybe just eat a little bit of instead of bingeing on. I felt like a crazy person in there, just wandering the aisles, salivating, dreaming of bingeing on everything.

,bulimia,"I have been purging (only binged a few times in my life) up to 30+ times a day for 20 years. There were moments where it was “just” a few times a month. But it was more than often once to three times a day. I saw blood in my vomit all the time. I got to the point where a sip of alcohol would make me projectile vomit, could not even make it one step. 
Here I am now. A very painful hiatal hernia, diagnosed today with Grade C Esophagitis and Reactive Gastropathy. I deal with daily difficulty eating now (loss of appetite, but also very difficult to swallow foods). I have extremely painful acid reflux, etc. I was obese at the height of my bulimia due to several factors (PCOS, severe hormonal imbalance, etc).

,bulimia,"[TW] Posted from an alt because I just know this would break my boyfriend's heart. I relapsed after 2 incredibly close friends left me, and honestly, this is probably the most effective coping method I have. I hate it, because I had been clean from b&amp;p for at least a year before this, but once everything happened, it just went downhill. Ever since this happened (almost 2 months now iirc), I've just been broken, and the stress has just amounted to a major relapse.

,bulimia,"Hi everyone, I am finally reaching out and really need some help. I have been bulimia for around 15 years, since late teens. It started because I was self conscious but it’s morphed into something else. I don’t throw up all my meals, only those that make me feel too full. Which is basically every dinner time (but not breakfast or lunch). I have tried to recover so many times but at this point my body can’t stand the feeling of being too full and I lay in bed feeling so full and sick that I end up purging. Also, it’s become a habit that I look forward to a big evening meal (maybe my body looks forward to the rush of purging?) and I don’t know how to do function without the promise of that at the end of the day, especially now I gave up smoking 5 years ago so don’t have that. I WISH I could get over this!

I have been bulimia for around 15 years, since late teens. It started because I was self conscious but it’s morphed into something else. I don’t throw up all my meals, only those that make me feel too full. Which is basically every dinner time (but not breakfast or lunch). I have tried to recover so many times but at this point my body can’t stand the feeling of being too full and I lay in bed feeling so full and sick that I end up purging. Also, it’s become a habit that I look forward to a big evening meal (maybe my body looks forward to the rush of purging?) and I don’t know how to do function without the promise of that at the end of the day, especially now I gave up smoking 5 years ago so don’t have that.

,bulimia,"Hello everyone.  


It has been a while since I made a post in this subreddit, and recovery for my gf (17) has been going great! It has been almost 4 months without a B/P and she has been doing very well. However, this past week, for whatever reason, her p\*rging urges have come back. One night, I dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p\*rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. Shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p\*rge. The good part is that I was with her, so I literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. This is the moment where I realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery.

Tonight was no different than the other experiences shared. We ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to McDonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the McDonalds bathroom (without telling me or anyone else) and started attempting to forcing a purge. If I hadn't have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p\*rged. 

I have told her many times that this is a problem that I want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she B/P (especially that night where I had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half), and she knows that too. 

Is there any recommendations that you guys have for recovery? It seems like she doesn't actually believe that it's a problem because its the 'first time in a while' but I know how relapses work and I know it will go right back to where we started if a relapse happens. She used to text me and ask for help and I would drop everything I was doing (often even texting her while driving home, or dropping everything I'm doing to go to her house and spend time with her) which seemed to help her a lot in her initial recovery journey. However, I feel like my effect on her and her ED has been cut down significantly to the point where she doesn't even listen to me anymore and I'm starting to feel like I'm not enough.

She has expressed that she does not want therapy, but would be okay with it if it means that she recovers (this happened in a conversation BEFORE the one we had today where she said that it is 'okay' to do what shes doing). Maybe even like a bulimia support group where she can talk to other people in a similar situation to her? Please help us with whatever you can- she can read this post too!

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I made a post in this subreddit, and recovery for my gf (17) has been going great! It has been almost 4 months without a B/P and she has been doing very well. However, this past week, for whatever reason, her p*rging urges have come back. One night, I dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p*rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. Shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p*rge. The good part is that I was with her, so I literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. This is the moment where I realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight was no different than the other experiences shared. We ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to McDonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the McDonalds bathroom (without telling me or anyone else) and started attempting to forcing a purge. If I hadn&amp;#39;t have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p*rged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have told her many times that this is a problem that I want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she B/P (especially that night where I had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half), and she knows that too. &lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"Honestly going in I was anticipating pro ED content and hoping to find suggestions, habits and more tools to encourage my ED. Much like those Instagram Thinspo acts..body checking photos of before and after etc. But as soon as I started digging, I found that…wow..people going through it. Struggling, seeing it made me realize something. I don’t want to shriek anymore…I don’t want to do this anymore. This community has really changed my thoughts. Don’t get me wrong I’m still head deep with my ED bullshit. But, I’m improving, I’m actively trying. Seeing y’all struggle has really gave me an outside view in my own struggles. The amount of love and hate I have for this disorder…

The amount of times I’ve read someone’s post and just wanted to help them, tell them they deserve to eat today. Tell them their Beautiful, their loved and all that good shit. Made me realize that, why do I wish so badly for you guys to heal while I continue to actively partake in this disorder. Why am I actively breaking down my body and screaming over meeting a basic healthy intake? But encouraging others to do better? Why can’t I allow myself to just…keep down a meal…when all I want to do when I read a post from here is hope and beg someone closer to “OP” to just fuckin get better b/c this disorder is so crippling….so so painful and lonely. I would beg if it would do anything to lessen the burden… And yet I wouldn’t allow a creamer cup touch my coffee…Fck I just want to say thank you. Thank you and I hope that all of you one day will get better. Idc how small the change, I just hope one day that you’ll be able to look in the mirror and say you love how you look.

Much like those Instagram Thinspo acts..body checking photos of before and after etc. But as soon as I started digging, I found that…wow..people going through it. Struggling, seeing it made me realize something. I don’t want to shriek anymore…I don’t want to do this anymore. This community has really changed my thoughts. Don’t get me wrong I’m still head deep with my ED bullshit. But, I’m improving, I’m actively trying. Seeing y’all struggle has really gave me an outside view in my own struggles. The amount of love and hate I have for this disorder…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of times I’ve read someone’s post and just wanted to help them, tell them they deserve to eat today. Tell them their Beautiful, their loved and all that good shit. Made me realize that, why do I wish so badly for you guys to heal while I continue to actively partake in this disorder. Why am I actively breaking down my body and screaming over meeting a basic healthy intake? But encouraging others to do better? Why can’t I allow myself to just…keep down a meal…when all I want to do when I read a post from here is hope and beg someone closer to “OP” to just fuckin get better b/c this disorder is so crippling….so so painful and lonely. I would beg if it would do anything to lessen the burden… And yet I wouldn’t allow a creamer cup touch my coffee…Fck I just want to say thank you. Thank you and I hope that all of you one day will get better. Idc how small the change, I just hope one day that you’ll be able to look in the mirror and say you love how you look. That you love yourself unconditionally no matter the form you take and no matter the comments others will make. One day I’ll be able to. And thanks to you guys, that day gets closer with every morning coffee.

,bulimia,"
Tw numbers, teeth decay, heartbreak

I had my first b/p in march 2020, after we had been evicted and my partner was with his other partner 
(We were polyamorous) because he was angry at me

I had undiagnosed orthorexia, with the occassional binge 
but this time I deliberately binged and purged as I had been taught how to by a book I owned about bulimia 

When my partner dumped me and threw me out the house we bought that summer after we had been evicted   from our apartment, I started to eat my feelings which then turned into daily binge eating and the occassional purging, at this time I purged maybe once/twice a month
but that came to change into once every other week and from that three times a week (after binges) into what is now a daily practice (several times a day sometimes).
I dont even binge daily anymore but I purge every meal.

Yesterday when I was going to brush my teeth I was shook. I have always been worried about my teeth. 
And i never thought I would developed purging because I always knew it was detrimental to teeth but somehow in the back of your mind you try to convince yourself its not going to happen to you. It only happens to other people. 

And now what? Quit ? This is definitely reason to. 

As if it was that easy.

As it is now purging has become an addiction.  

Im addicted to the high I get from the hormones release after I vomit. It feels amazing and calming and I need it.

I have also severely developed a weight phobia I didnt have before, I was always more orthorexia than ana, I didnt care about my weight but was shit scared of ""toxin""

But now after years of binge eating my weight has gone up quite a lot and its making me soo uncomfortable, that I really have developed this fear of weight gain now. 

And ironically I drink as well, despite knowing alcohol is known for weight gain, but its just so nice to get drunk when I feel like absolute shit hell. And I dont drink moderately, I dont have only 2 glasses, I have the whole bottle and drink until I puke (alone in my apartment).

Will I stop purging anytime soon ? No.

Will I stop eating loads of sugary foods ? No.

Will I stop drinking several cups of coffee/tea? No.

Will stop drinking each weekend until puke? No.

Will I stop neglecting brushing my teeth? No.

I can tell myself I will. I can list all the reasons to recover.
But. I KNOW MYSELF. I know exactly what I ""should"" do.
But I still get stuck in these bad behaviours.

And its impossible to access therapy, I tried. For so long.
During the whole 3 year relationship with my ex partner I was trying to get access to mental health services but they wanted to evaluated me for ADHD, no not that.
And they wanted to look out for bipolar 2, no not that.
And when I finally got diagnosed with BPD, my relationship with my partner was completely broken, he had blocked me, I had been homeless for a while but was living in an apartment with some friends, several bulimia, my whole life was about overexercising, worry about food, binge eating, purging and restricting and by the time I got the diagnosis I was homeless again. 
So psych hasnt helped shit. 

And since a lot of this disorder is about my ex partner, I dont really see a future where I am free of it. Unless, I get  hold of enough money to get addicted to heroin but thats  bad as well (for a while when I was homeless I did H).

I have tried religion, but I realised recently that praying cannot get rid of this whole in my heart and I had a bit of a faith crisis because of it. 

Other than that, I really really really dont know what to do.

Im sad about my teeth.
As a Child I cared soo much about my teeth.

&lt;p&gt;I had my first b/p in march 2020, after we had been evicted and my partner was with his other partner 
(We were polyamorous) because he was angry at me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had undiagnosed orthorexia, with the occassional binge 
but this time I deliberately binged and purged as I had been taught how to by a book I owned about bulimia &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my partner dumped me and threw me out the house we bought that summer after we had been evicted   from our apartment, I started to eat my feelings which then turned into daily binge eating and the occassional purging, at this time I purged maybe once/twice a month
but that came to change into once every other week and from that three times a week (after binges) into what is now a daily practice (several times a day sometimes).
I dont even binge daily anymore but I purge every meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday when I was going to brush my teeth I was shook. I have always been worried about my teeth. 
And i never thought I would developed purging because I always knew it was detrimental to teeth but somehow in the back of your mind you try to convince yourself its not going to happen to you. It only happens to other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now what? Quit ? This is definitely reason to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if it was that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is now purging has become an addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im addicted to the high I get from the hormones release after I vomit. It feels amazing and calming and I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also severely developed a weight phobia I didnt have before, I was always more orthorexia than ana, I didnt care about my weight but was shit scared of &amp;quot;toxin&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now after years of binge eating my weight has gone up quite a lot and its making me soo uncomfortable, that I really have developed this fear of weight gain now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ironically I drink as well, despite knowing alcohol is known for weight gain, but its just so nice to get drunk when I feel like absolute shit hell. And I dont drink moderately, I dont have only 2 glasses, I have the whole bottle and drink until I puke (alone in my apartment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I stop purging anytime soon ? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I stop eating loads of sugary foods ? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I stop drinking several cups of coffee/tea? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will stop drinking each weekend until puke? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I stop neglecting brushing my teeth? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell myself I will. I can list all the reasons to recover.
But. I KNOW MYSELF. I know exactly what I &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; do.
But I still get stuck in these bad behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And its impossible to access therapy, I tried. For so long.
During the whole 3 year relationship with my ex partner I was trying to get access to mental health services but they wanted to evaluated me for ADHD, no not that.
And they wanted to look out for bipolar 2, no not that.
And when I finally got diagnosed with BPD, my relationship with my partner was completely broken, he had blocked me, I had been homeless for a while but was living in an apartment with some friends, several bulimia, my whole life was about overexercising, worry about food, binge eating, purging and restricting and by the time I got the diagnosis I was homeless again. 
So psych hasnt helped shit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since a lot of this disorder is about my ex partner, I dont really see a future where I am free of it. Unless, I get  hold of enough money to get addicted to heroin but thats  bad as well (for a while when I was homeless I did H).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried religion, but I realised recently that praying cannot get rid of this whole in my heart and I had a bit of a faith crisis because of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I really really really dont know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sad about my teeth.
As a Child I cared soo much about my teeth.
I had never any holes in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now my teeth are decaying and there isnt much I can do about it, because I am stuck in this addiction. &lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"having moved out, i'm now free to fuck up my life however i choose to and without oversight that has become a continuation of binging and purging every day, usually multiple times, spending usually around $20 per session and it's draining my bank account faster than i'd like to admit.  

i was underweight for a good portion of 2021 but i've maintained a normal 'healthy' weight for quite a while now, almost a year. frankly my eating habits are all over the place, i've got a really bad snacking/grazing pattern and the b/p is frequent enough to fuck up anything. i lost weight b/p'ing in the past but that was when i hardly ate outside of it. i can't do that now. my job is pretty physically demanding (i work at a nursing home), and i just don't think i can restrict at all anymore.

I had an endoscopy about a month ago and got the results about a week after. They confirmed my stomach is paralyzed, with moderate gastritis throughout my entire stomach/colon.

I’ve been purging since 19, and I’m 25 now. I would puke after every meal and b/p for hours on the weekends, sometimes up to 20+ times a day.

I am prescribed ensures, reglan, and enough zofran for a cancer patient. My life is constant stomach pain and bloating. It’s on the foreground of my mind all day how much my stomach hurts. I have since drastically reduced the amount I purge, but the damage has been done. The docs told me taking reglan (gut motility stimulator) will eventually lead to tremors, so I have that to look forward to as well.

I'm so tired of this cycle. I go through cycles of uncontrollable anxiety, feelings of losing control, then back to the severe restriction/feeling like I'm in control but knowing it's bad thing. 

I just came out of a week straight of severe restriction. And yes I had a reason why I was extra depressed. I have custody of my daughter (2) and have to go a whole week away from her 2 times a year. No coparenting, he's a jerk, I can't know how my daughter is doing more than 2 times a week, etc. It triggered it and I BARELY ate. But oddly I felt in control of my eating. Ever since I got her back, of course it made me happier. But my anxiety got the switch flipped in the opposite direction. Now I have been battling for a week now this uncontrollable overwhelming feeling of anxiety where all I want to do is binge eat whatever I want. I gave up/ into it yesterday. I thought that maybe if I gave myself one day, it may chill out. Then today it peaked. I ended up making myself throw up. I don't throw up a lot. Of i do, once a day and I've never done more than 3 times a week. But I still don't like it and I hate the mental ish it does to me and how it makes me feel. My skin crawls till I just have to get it out. I feel like no matter how we do things differently that the demon in our brains probably is the same.

How do you stop the feeling?? The never ending persistent nagging feeling of feeling out of control and that you have to DO SOMETHING (binge) (purge) or you'll go nuts! I can't stand it. It makes me feel completely nuts. After I threw up I took a small dose Xanax I'm prescribed for in the moment situations. I try to use them sparingly but I feel like this qualified... it didn't do the trick so I took one more an hour later. Right now I'm just chilling on the couch finally leveled out and just wallowing in my feelings and feeling shitty. How and why am I plagued with this? How do you deal. Why is binging even a thing?

,bulimia,"It has been a long, hard road. I never thought that I would have the strength to come this far. Literally never, I remember times when I would sit by the toilet covered in my own puke sobbing and wishing it would all just end because I just couldn’t do it anymore. I was so deep in the hole I thought that I would never climb my way out. 

Throwing up 3-7 times a day or not eating at all. Isolating myself, pushing everyone away. Not living, just surviving until the next meal. Dropping out of college. Severe anxiety and depression. Celibacy for seven years because the thought of someone seeing me naked or touching me gave me panic attacks. Getting close or letting someone know my secret. No period for nearly a decade, still unaware if there are consequences from that and I’m still too scared to go to the doctor and find out. Uncontrolled type one diabetes as a result from uncontrolled binging and not taking insulin. Having my left pinky toe amputated bc of complications from the uncontrolled diabetes. Having several teeth pulled and several chipped. Going into cardiac arrest twice and being in a coma for a week.

,bulimia,"I just wanted to post on here to kind of get it off my chest. I know community can help, so just doing this here. 

I’m 30(m) and I’ve been b/p for roughly 12years. It started after my first year of college when I saw pictures of myself and how much I had gained weight during that year. Prior to college, I was in the best shape of my youth because of cross country and just eating better in general (opting for salads vs greasy school lunch). In the summer between freshman and sophomore year of college, I started waking up every morning to go running. Would make myself breakfast (eggs and toast)— however, I was not satisfied with the lack of immediate results. I never thought I would have developed an ED, but my body dysmorphia really took a hold of me and slowly I started to purge, even after eating healthier meals of rice/chicken/veggie bowls. After a while, I started to purge multiple times/day. When I came back to college for sophomore year, so many people were telling me how great I looked and it was nice hearing the affirmations of the “work” I was putting into my body. I think these affirmations exasperated my ED. Starting college, I went back to my bad eating habits because I could just b/p it later. It became consistently after each meal, then multiple times after each meal just to ensure I got every last bit of food back out. 

B/P became constant to the point of doing it in my dorm while my roommates were out. At restaurants (as long as they were single room stalls— couldn’t do it in shared rooms). And port-o-potties. 

After I moved in with my then partner, the shame/embarrassment of them finding out “helped” me take about an 8mo break. But as I saw pictures of myself, that same feeling of “woah, I let myself go” came back and I went back into purging discreetly after each meal. 

I’ve never told anyone, nor have my doctors/dentists ever mentioned physical signs of the possibility of it. 

Currently I’m purging about once per day, typically after a heavy meal because I feel shitty/heavy afterwards and I’ve developed some sort of indigestion/acid reflux (which I’m sure is as a result of B/P).

,bulimia,"THE BACKSTORY IS SO LONG SORRY U CAN READ FROM FURTHER DOWN!

tw! 
last year i had an eating disorder. i have never met a healthcare professional about it, i’ve never been diagnosed. i had some sort of OSFED, purging disorder might be the most accurate if i had to put a name on it. i was obsessed with everything to do with food, i loved it but my one goal in life was to eat as little cals, burn as many cals as i could. tbh i didn’t eat enough but never restricted as much as a rexie nor eat enough to call it a binge. i purged most times i ate something “bad”. i definitely had so much guilt and anxiety around food it was so exhausting. 

then, i started to gym and forced myself into this new “obsession” of getting strong, eating enough macros, new things that i could do to change my body. i always seem to need a new obsession to get rid of an old one. it was my way of recovery, i was developing the “positive mindset” of food while still focussing on my body. it was “you NEED to eat at least __ protein, __ cals, or you’re restricting!!” “eat lots of whatever and do not purge or you’ll lose gains” seems great, because it was undoing typical ed behaviour. but now that i think about it, i just wanted to be hyper fixated on something. it seemed like toxic positivity. 

^that was a year ago in july 2021. eventually, it started to be less about the food, more about the exercises. i genuinely enjoyed lifting weights, i missed being at the gym when i wasn’t there. i feel as though this was my new obsession, moving on from food. (ive noticed a pattern of becoming so interested in one thing, putting all my energy into it, then it fades and bores me greatly) december/january was my peak in loving gym because i knew heaps about it now. i considered myself fully recovered from ed. i didn’t think about calories, i stopped counting them. i ate enough and guilt-free, there was just no ed in my brain.   

maybe around march/april i stopped being consistent bc i started losing motivation and love for gymming. it was just boring and repetitive. and bc now i was positive and ed-free, i did not force myself to gym if i didn’t want to. 

since the start of this year, i’ve had phases of having no appetite. eg id lose my appetite for a few days, it comes back for 2 weeks. and the cycle repeats. but i just forced myself to eat anyway. i did not even consider it to be ed-related i just thought it may be stress or something. 

today, i’ve had no appetite for like 10 days so i go on a google search and all the causes of loss of appetite don’t seem to match me. so i have a dig into my thoughts and i realise that recently i’ve purposefully used this to not eat and i haven’t forced myself to eat like usual. and i tracked it back, 11 days ago i zoned out eating cheesecake and thought about the calories in it and kind of freaked out but i still ate it and felt fine after. so that probably triggered this appetite loss. i’ve realised i lose my appetite whenever i have an overly filling meal. 

i used love food, but now, i could not give less fucks about it. i don’t enjoy it, eating feels like a chore. and too many foods seem unappetising. even when i find something i feel like eating, when i do, i realise it was overhyped in my mind. I JUST CANT BE BOTHERED TO EAT. 

i caught myself thinking what if i just relapse it’ll be so much easier this time. and i’m physically hungry but just not eating bc “might as well lose weight while i don’t feel like eating”. and right now, i have no obsession as i am bored of the gym. my mind is so confused.

,bulimia,"I used to binge and purge like 20 times a week at least for years. Probably more. I genuinely didn't count and truly have no idea except that I spent about $800-950 a month on average on food.

I'm taking my own approach to recovery which is cut down, there are days when I still just need to and I'm not going to attack myself for that,.
 make sure I'm meeting as many  ""recommended"" dietary requirements as I can. Just eating and downing water whenever I feel a bit too low (vaguely set amount for the day but no specific meal sizing or times) it's usually what you'd expect a healthy adult to eat, and not engaging in heavy physical activity (although this is just time constraints and laziness).


Well I probably had my best week in like a decade. Only twice in a week. And today I feel like CRAP.

The whole week, i had decent sleep, went for a couple of strolls, ate electrolyte icy poles a couple of times. Took vitamin D and iron, included carbs at least once a day. Had my veggies, my tuna, eggs, my oats, my fruit, my calcium... I'm massively minimizing the junk food as it goes hand in hand with binging for me that's the only big difference.

Otherwise I had an MRI scan that possibly took a lot out of me and a pretty massive commute four days straight. 

But I don't understand how I feel this bad when I'm eating so much better.

,bulimia,"so I've had an eating disorder or the past 7 years, the first 4 years were a cycle of restricting and binging, and the last 3 years were full blown bulimia, and it's getting pretty severe. Within the past 6 months or so I've been experiencing chest pains and intense headaches and major brain fog/memory loss/mental blackouts. It's escalated rapidly to the point where my chest hurts so much I have to sit down with a heartbeat of 150, even on days where I don't purge, and eat a ""normal"" amount. I haven't been to the doctor for a checkup in over 7 years. I found out recently that my family has a history of cancerous cells and aortic aneurysms. I know logically I should tell my doctor that I have bulimia because eating disorders are notorious for hurting internal organs, but 1) I'm afraid he won't take me seriously since im in my early 20s, and write all my symptoms off as bulimia related and if I stop purging they'll go away, and 2) he'll force me into a recovery center which I can't do because I'm a adult with a job to go to and rent to pay.

,bulimia,"ive been seeing this guy for about 3 months now. i usually dont get into relationships that often because my ed escalates x100 when im in them. i never have spoken about it to anybody really in my life though.

2nd date we were on he held my hand and was just innocently captivated at how small and boney my hands/wrists were. i didnt mind that and to be honest felt good when we were comparing hands and mine were smaller. he verbally noticed when i only had two small bites of my burger.

last date we were at this bar/restaurant. he got a meal but i just had a bit of the appetizer. i notice he likes to touch me or my stuff a lot and i like that. so it wasnt out of the ordinary. but he grabbed my upper arm area and squeezed it and jiggled it a bit and said ‘you need to work out more’. i literally wanted to die right then and there but pretended to be unbothered and joked it off.

i was already doing the usual restricting and purging beforehand, and it was bad to where i physically couldnt eat more than two bites without feeling sick, but feeling sick from starving too. but after that i slipped back right into the deep abyss. i was pretty laid back before this happening, and now im incredibly depressed and anxious all the time.

i feel conflicted because i want to not care about it so bad. but i think about that all the time. and it creates a domino effect onto all the other times someone has made a comment or something. i like him and hanging out with him is super fun. so i dont want to be a downer.

i dont want to say anything to make him think im a freak or damaged. but i want him to be more mindful of his comments on my body. maybe a subtle way to let him know? or maybe i just need some advice on how to live with them and not let them bother me. we are hanging out tomorrow for a longer time so im kind of nervous.",t2_drgu1do8,False,,0,False,"guy im dating touching/measuring me, says i need to work out more",[],r/bulimia,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_vyn573,False,dark,0.88,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1657773194.0,text,0,,,text,self.bulimia,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;ive been seeing this guy for about 3 months now. i usually dont get into relationships that often because my ed escalates x100 when im in them. i never have spoken about it to anybody really in my life though.&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"I had my 1 year free of B/P anniversary a week ago and a few people asked what my steps were to get where I am at. This is my personal journey and one size doesn’t fit all but maybe one of these things could be helpful to someone.

A little about me: I have had Bulimia for 15 years and restrictive eating for 2 years before that. I started my EDs when I was 11 and I am now about to be 29 years old. I grew up in a very abusive household and my way to cope with the trauma was through my EDs.

I never saw professional help for my EDs but I will say that I started seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression almost 2 years ago. And that’s what I wanted to highlight here today. Bulimia is a coping strategy. B/P is a way to deal with unresolved emotional trauma and for me, the breakthrough for my recovery was making the connection as to why I was doing what I was doing and then having someone acknowledge and validate my feelings. Once I started talking about my trauma and pain I was able to start coping strategies that were healthy for me.

My coping strategies that have helped me the most are:

1. Journaling- helps gets whatever you’re feeling and thinking out of your head.
2. Walking-30 minutes a day will help keep your mind and body healthy.
3. Yoga- calm body movements matched to the rhythm of your breathing is incredibly relaxing and healing. Yoga with Adrienne is my go to.
4. Support system- you need at least one person to lean on. I feel like my therapist is someone who I feel a lot of respect for and who I feel has my best interests at heart as well as my one good friend who also has my back. 

The first 3 things are apart of my daily routine. And the 4th thing is a few times a week. 

Therapy is something that I thought wasn’t obtainable. I had a handful of bad experiences with potential therapists in the past that made me almost give up on the idea. But once you find someone that you like, it’s seriously life changing. My therapist is trained for AEDP therapy which is short for Accelerated Experimental Dynamic Psychotherapy. “It is talk therapy that aims to help people overcome trauma, loss or some other serious emotional challenges.” From google haha. 



This is what I felt was the core of my recovery.

I don’t do anything for exercise besides walking 23,000 steps a day due to working an active job and going for walks. 

I’ve had an eating disorder for the past 6 years (started with AN, now I’m AN-BP and have been purging at least once a day for the past year).

I’ve been in and out of treatment services but have been stigmatized for being a man, and thrown to the wasteside because of my severe OCD and Borderline Personality Disorder that makes taking steps to change difficult, but I’m at my wits end and in so much pain I just want a break and to eat a bit more.

I’ve always had swollen/chubby cheeks, but now it’s swollen jowls.

This isn’t even my body dysmorphia talking anymore, even my mom noticed my neck. She’s not the type to say anything and she wanted to retake the photo because of how my “head was tilted”, but I know it was because of my big saggy turkey neck.

It feels like maybe just low key purging is my &amp;quot;vice&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s a waste of a therapist&amp;#39;s time to be piddling on about something like this, especially given that it&amp;#39;s not going to really improve me any to stop?&lt;/p&gt;

I used to just binge and then feel crappy and guilt after, but now my brain is like, hmm, just vomit it out and then you feel way better. Still got to enjoy the food and eat your feelings.
Then I wash my teeth afterwards and my brain is still like, I mean atleadt you are doing something good for yourself after that, but i freaking know its sooo bad.

,bulimia,"This is the worst type of eating disorder I can imagine ever going through. With anorexia you can at least still fit in your jeans even though the thought of looking in the mirror is killing you. BED has you knowing from the beginning that you'll never be your ideal distorted fucked up body type. But I feel like bulimia has given me hope, and I hate it so much.

I've succeeded in reaching my goal weigh last year and it lasted for quite some time. I felt invincible, the whole world just seemed brighter and life didn't feel so unbearable. For me it was ""good enough"". I loved the way I looked and I felt amazing. I didn't wanna lose more weight, I just wanted to maintain it. 

But then I started to miss my period and I have the softest spot there is for kids and I really want to have one someday. I knew I had to stop, so I did. I also fucked up my teeth in the process so we had to give a lot of money to random dentists. The problem is that once I started to eat normally, you guessed it, I wasn't able to stop. 

I GOT BACK TO WHERE I STARTED. None of my old jeans fit anymore, I feel my face getting fatter and it also shows, my beautiful legs have vanished, my arm tattoo looks like shit now and the outfits I once looked like a princess in make me look like a stuffed potato.

I can't financially afford to buy a new wardrobe and I can't afford going back to my old habits because of the teeth problems that would come with them. I simply can't, my parents are barely getting by as it is. But the thought of staying like this is killing me. I can't stand looking in the mirror and I hate every single part of this recovery journey. I hurt physically when I eat, yet I still do it. Mentally I've hit rock bottom. There's nothing left of me worth knowing. I can't form any new friendships or realtionships because my brain only thinks about how much I want to simply disappear. 

The point of this post is to vent and to tell you that if you somehow managed to not get lost just yet in this disorder, I'm begging you to please seek professional help. I don't want to discredit any other eating disorders (because they are really not to be discredited). The false idea of hope that I felt for so long because of bulimia has literally messed me up beyond anything.

,bulimia,"I've gotten into an amazing relationship these past months, she is an amazing person and someone whom I hold very dearly. Our relationship happened completely spontaneously in a span of about two months of us two meeting for the first time, and we are doing great together. Life has never looked brighter for me;

yet I am still struggling with alcoholism, self-harming, and suicidal thoughts. Frankly, I feel selfish and disgusted by that fact, considering my life is going so great nowadays, I realize these issues don't go away instantly and that there are other factors, and I understand that my thoughts are in fact irrational, however, it's still hard not feeling like a selfish asshole considering the circumstances.

My partner is bulimic, and it's extremely hard going through that with her. Bulimia and self-harm are deeply connected, so it isn't hard for me to sympathize, addiction-like cravings and uncontrollable urges are the norm for both of us, disregarding the differing reasons. She believes she does not deserve the food that she eats, and she has a hard time controlling herself when eating, so she often eats large quantities of food in an extremely short time span and feels extremely guilty afterward, both mentally and physically in pain.

I am lucky enough to be quite socially intelligent, so I know how to say things in a way that avoids backhanded compliments, triggering urges, and giving ideas, I know how to calm her down in most cases, however, that does not work so well when she isn't with me and is alone at home. For personal reasons we cannot in any shape or form attend therapy or a nutritionist, I have begun reading books about bulimia treatment and other related media in an attempt to be as helpful as I can.

But this is so fucking tough, I am having a hard time helping her, I feel like I am losing the motivation to help the person I care about the most, and I feel so guilty and disgusting because of it. I want to keep helping her, I really do, but this is so hard, she deserves to feel good so much, she's such an amazing person, but I really don't know, I am lost here.

,bulimia,"okay, so i have a therapist. and she's not like a bad therapist she's pretty nice and hasn't done or said anything outrageous to me. and my issue is that i *genuinely try* to open up to her. but i literally can not bring myself to like share my feelings and stuff to her?? like before my session i'm like *okay i'm going to go in there and talk about my feelings* and then she actually asks me about stuff and i freeze and deflect.

and like i sort of feel bad for her. because she physically can not do her job because of me. and i actually *want* to recover, but whatever stupid thing is keeping me from talking to her is stopping me from letting her help me.

but i actually don't know what to do?? it actually shocks me the stuff i freely share on reddit, because i would never say anything this personal to me out loud. but i don't know WHY?? it's not my therapist's fault, she's like the fifth therapist that i've struggled to open up to. she's actually been the most successful of all of them because i've at least admitted to her that i still purge sometimes.

but i guess has anyone else ever been in this situation? what helped you feel comfortable talking about uncomfortable and embarrassing feelings irl? because i know this sounds really stupid but it's like when i try to talk about these things, my mind goes blank and i forget all my feelings, or my mouth just like, forms a mind of its own and constructs some sort of vague manipulation of the truth.

so does anyone have advice over how they overcame a situation like this??

I (15F) struggle with body image issues, weight issues, and some sort of eating disorder.

,bulimia,"So here I am once again. Sitting on the same bathroom floor I’ve always sat at. In the same place every b/p, s/h and every attempt of mine has ever happened. 

After 6 months of successful bulimic recovery and 2 months after another failed attempt I still sit here and hope for some wisdom from some divine god like figure asking why I still feel so lonely.

Why the regular meals feel like binges and the friends I make feel like they’re paid to laugh at my jokes like some hideous laugh track of my life. One of those laugh tracks that was made in the 70’s and all the people laughing are now dead. Just empty hallow laughter. 

In these 6 months I kept myself so busy. Busy enough to ignore the weight gain or weight loss, the dehydration and the healed up scars I can’t bare to look at anymore.

And yet still after 6 months of doing so fucking good I still want to do it. It sucks to never want to get better. To hope you’ll get the call that a bed opened up at an eating disorder residential and you’ll finally feel home again because you might finally feel sick enough.

Sick enough to meet the needs of your 10 year old selves sick bulimic fantasy. The one where you were fragile enough to be carried on the wind and everyone finally loved you because of how small you were and how they were all jealous.

I’m concerned for my friend. She has a history of bulimia. She has been okay for a few years apparently and she typically eats anything and doesn’t seem to think about calories or say or do anything alarming. 

I’ve spent the weekend with her and noticed twice she went to the bathroom and had a video playing on her phone (only 1st time) and constantly running water and I could very faintly hear retching and spitting although not constantly so it was hard to tell.

Second time she has been clearing her throat a lot after coming out of the bathroom.

To look after myself like I do with other issues, instead of giving in to the urge. &amp;#39;Aggressive empathy&amp;#39; has been my motto for some time, and I try to show that to myself and others. So yeah wanted to share and also this is good for me to put things into words every once and a while. Sending aggressively empathetic vibes to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been binging every day for the past week or week and a half, which is way more often than I ever did in the past… and I feel like I’ve been eating constantly for at least the past month and have gained weight as a result, which makes me feel mortified but also makes the binges worse because I eat to self-soothe. 

I’ve been in trauma therapy for about 8 months and don’t know if my therapist works with people with EDs which makes me a little afraid to tell her about all this, partly due to shame and partly because I’m afraid she’ll refer me to someone else.

In order to try and improve treatment options for eating disorders, I'm trying to better understand the process of recovery and what motivates it by looking at the role online support groups (such as FB groups, discussion forums and subreddits) have in their members recovery.

Taking part involves completing an anonymous online survey consisting of 11 questions altogether. 3 are short demographic ones and 8 need a little more time and attention.

A few months ago it was so bad I even reached out to a few ED treatment facilities but never followed through. I suppose what I’m getting at here is how did you stop ? I know the health risk, they don’t scare me. Nothing seems to. I feel almost invincible like this can’t kill me. I have no will to stop and if I’m being honest I want to lose more weight but a part of me knows I need to.&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"Hi. This is my (30f) first time speaking about this issue. Today felt low for me so I searched reddit. I'm not sure what exactly I am but I know I have issues. I have always dealt with anxiety first of all. I've had it my entire life, and I (for the most part) have my own coping mechanisms that work. From the outside looking in, I'm a happy, outgoing, successful woman with a wonderful family. 

I have always had body issues since a young age. I had severe asthma since I was 5 which means I took steroids often. Steroids make you HUNGRY so I grew up chubby- hence the body issues. I remember my anxiety causing me many issues growing up and making me binge eat a lot. I had no idea why I did it and no one really noticed. I grew out of my asthma mostly and started working out in my early 20s. I am 5'7"" and went from 225 back then to holding at a steady 185 now. I found out recent years I also have Hashimotos. I have a family history of obesity and I'm TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I'm still trying to lose more weight to get to my goal weight of 160. I like to think I'd be happy there. 

Recently in the past couple of years, I've had my anxiety get triggered by severe issues going on in my life which throw off my stomach, nerves, etc to the point of feeling out of control. Makes me want anything in order to make the feeling stop. So I occasionally binge eat in the moment then immediately regret it. I already am on a strict diet and fast most of the day. The guilt is so heavy that I HAVE to throw up immediately. I don't do it regularly so I'm not sure when you're allowed to ""label"" it. It happens when my anxiety is out of control. I did start marking it in a calendar. I did it 3 times in one week in February, 2 times in one week in March, and I've been fine till today. 

Today was the worst I've ever done and felt so worse than the other times. I had something heavy in my life happen today. I've never felt so low. I need a way to stop the overwhelming anxiety feeling I get of being out of control. What have any of you learned to do to cope with that feeling?

,bulimia,"Hi,

Sorry for misspells as english is not my first language.

I really don't know where to ask for help. I've had a binge eating disorder for years. My family doctor told me what it was two years ago. I started going to an ED recovery unit this month, my next visit is this tuesday. I've only seen the doctors there once. I'm gonna talk about sensitive topics.

Last week I binged at night, badly. I felt so bad, so dirty, I felt so much hate. I went to the bathroom and vomited. The next day I ate lunch. I felt sick. At night, I tried to eat dinner. I felt sick again, I couldn't take it, went to the toilet again. Yesterday and today I ate too much. Tried ""compensating"" for the calories by not eating for as long as I could and trying to vomit again.

I've been doing the ""trying to make calories even"" for years. I will binge and then not eat, I never took it as fasting, I just would eat less or nothing for as many hours as I could. Some times I exercised too. 

Today, my mum said something along the lines of, imagine the drama if now I'm bulimic, (with worry, of course), as I'm already in another therapy for a bunch of other stuff. 

I feel really guilty. Sometimes I HAVE to make myself eat or my mum won't want to eat either. I don't want to make her worry anymore. I feel like a failure that I suddenly got worse, I feel so much shame. I don't want to tell my doctors. I don't want to look at myself. I don't even want to open the window blinds to let light inside my room so I see less of me. I just wish the ground would swallow me and replace me with a healthy me. 

I don't know where to go from here. My mum supports me in everything but I'm so ashamed. I feel like the same little girl who was force-fed at lunch in preschool and hid her pockets full of chewed and vomited food til she came home, the same little girl who was so underweight because she didn't want to eat. Now I'm overweight. I never even considered bulimia and I'm so scared of hurting my mum but the shame is worse. 

If anyone reads this, I guess I just need someone to tell me I'm not crazy. For years I've been told by teachers, classmates, family and friends that I'm an attention-seeker but the thing I want the least is attention. I don't wanna be seen as one again. I don't wanna be seen at all.

,bulimia,"I went to the psychiatrist a few days ago and told him that I’m really desperate to put an end to my bulimia. I’ve been suffering from bulimia for over 12 years, restriction for over 13 years, and binge eating for over 21 years. I’m 25 now.

He expressed that, and I quote, “I’m still alive, so it’s not his ‘main worry’ right now”. He said that my other mental health issues are the main concern (ADHD, PTSD, depression/anxiety, panic disorder, etc.) Despite me telling him that my eating disorder *literally* rules my life, he insisted that I “look good” and “seem to be doing well”. I told him that I hadn’t washed my hair in a week, and had to drag myself out of bed that day. It was the first time I had even *gone outside*, let alone gone somewhere in public in *weeks*. 

When my bulimia is bad, I isolate myself. I feel swollen, low energy, depressed, and just overall paralyzed. He still continued to say that “well, you’re still alive, aren’t you?” Although he was trying to lift my spirits, all I could hear was “you’re not sick enough for it to be a concern”. I’m a normal weight right now, but I used to be morbidly obese. I lost weight (and all my hair) rapidly from bulimia. I’m still going and I hope that one day I will be taken seriously.

I told my friend a few days ago and yesterday we were at mcdonalds I went to the bathroom after my meal. I just finished and a worker walked in to check op on me which my friend sent. I felt so angry and betrayed even though I know she meant well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only been going on for about a week or so now but every day it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Should I just wait and see if this blows over?&lt;/p&gt;

This entire thing makes me disappointed in myself i was doing so well until i felt like i failed after eating a bit too much low cal ice cream. I lose control very easily nowadays and purge for the simplest things i just have to get it out of my system so i feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

When I started it, I wanted to get at 75 kg and then, I wanted to stop, but I didn't calculated the side effects on my mental and physical health😅. I am always tired and cold, even if others wear a T-shirt, I wear hoodies. Also I started binging with I never did in the beginning phase. And a few days ago, I had a free day and all I did, was sleeping way too long, and b/p three times in a row and the rest of the time, I was on TikTok, until my family came home and  the day was over.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared.

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

,bulimia,"Figured maybe this might help other people. Obviously we all struggle with body image,  whenever I'm feeling down I think to myself that every part of my body only cares about me and keeping me alive. 

Think of your body as an apartment building.  All the tenants repair it and the landlord almost never has to do anything to fix it.  When the roof is damaged after a storm, the tenants all go to repair it immediately as their #1 priority. The landlord doesnt even need to swing by. They are the best tenants ever and hardly ever ask anything of the landlord  and instead just fix things that need fixing IMMEDIATELY before anything else gets done. They never procrastinate. 

Now imagine the landlord comes by all the time with a sledgehammer and makes holes in the walls and kicks all the doors down. But as a tenant, they dont have any power. They know the landlord won't stop and isn't going to fix it. So they just go and repair the immediate mess and leave the other stuff on the backburner until they repair the most damaging mess first. 

But the landlord keeps damaging the building so often that the tenants can't keep up anymore. There are water leaks, broken pipes, an overgrown lawn, and weeds everywhere. But they don't have time to tend to those. They have to fix the landlord's damage first and don't have time to get to the other things.  

 I think of my organs and blood cells as the tenants and myself as the landlord. And purging is the damage I'm causing.  My organs work tirelessly 24/7 to keep me alive. I am lucky enough to be able-bodied and not have chronic health issues. I have zero things wrong with my body. I have no reason to be mad at it.

,bulimia,"idk if I belong here. If this is triggering or if I should go somewhere else, please let me know, and I'll delete. My history is sort of weird.

I've always had almost no appetite. I would just go about my life until I was suddenly **starving**. So I'd try to plan meals so that I never got to that point. But it was always just a chore. I didn't feel as much hunger or pleasure from food as most people did.

It's not annorexia, because I've never thought much about food or my weight. But my whole life, I ate so little that I think I qualify for EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) in the DSM 5.

A thing that used to happen -- which hasn't in a while -- is that I'd get so skinny that it would start to affect my well-being. So then I'd eat a tube of cookie dough over the course of a couple of days to give myself some padding to burn through again. Not amazing, I know.

Then I went on Welbutrin, which suppresses your appetite. That fucked me up for a while, but then I adjusted, so I even without an appetite, I ate more or less the right amount.

Now I'm going off Welbutrin, and for the first time, I'm feeling, like......  psychological hunger? I got 2/3 through a Chipotle burrito, and my stomach was like ""We're done"" but my brain was like ""Keep eating."" I somehow consumed, like, half a big bottle of honey in a few days. My normal ""let's not starve"" meals aren't stopping me from eating random sugary bullshit.

I've heard that when you quit smoking, people gain an average of 40 lbs. I don't want that. If I gain some weight, that's fine. But I don't want this to spin out of control.

I feel out of control. I don't like this. It's so distracting. It takes up so much time. I don't know what I'm supposed to do about these feelings. But maybe they're healthy and normal? I have no idea.

because of this it got to the point where i sent her a text on snapchat a few days ago just veryyy briefly saying that i have ""struggled with an eating disorder"" i know what it’s like to do that and how it worries me when she sends snaps/brings it up as if she does it too.

i replied saying ""dont talk to me if you don't like me"" for her to send another voice note, this time it was her friend using her phonesaying ""dont make yourself sick, dont be sick, i didnt mean that im so sorry"" with my friend in the background gasping as to say don't say that.

Hi all, I'm looking for tips on how to feel full and satisfied after eating a meal. These days I have a terrible habit of binging and most of tbe time purging after because I feel so guilty. I have always struggled with my body image, especially because growing up I had multiple family members always telling me to watch what I eat and telling me that my portion sizes would make me the size of a house, or that I would end up like my mom, who is a little overweight (yes they really would tell me that). 

At the time I didn't understand but in hindsight my portion sizes were not excessive and I had pleasure from food. But all of these nasty comments in combination with social media and societal standards deeply warped my perception of myself and food itself.

Eventually I found myself in love with the gym in highschool and ate very healthy a majority of the time and would still indulge in treats. My relationship with myself and food was finally reaching a healthy place, until circumstances pulled me away from the gym. It was heart wrenching to be away from what was my escape from the world and my problems.

This, in addition to being in abusive relationships, led me down a dark path of food restriction. For an entire year I would limit myself to about 500 calories a day and nonstop caffiene, and would be fine eating a lollipop as a meal. It became almost impossible to even finish a breakfast biscuit from McDonald's because I would get so full. This continued on into college with a slight progression of eating more. I tried to get back into the gym but was very discouraged because I had been out for so long it felt like starting at square one again. I was on and off with going to the gym as covid kept opening and shutting down the gym.

I eventually found myself out of two abusive relationships and hitting the gym more often. I was tolerant of myself and even made the decision to finally get help for my mental health which I've struggled with all my life.

However, once I started psych meds that all went through the window. I did okay for awhile but at one point I just absolutely spiraled and lost myself. All I did was smoke weed and feel sorry for myself because my life felt such a mess. I eventually put myself in a treatment facility and ""graduated"" with the self help tools I needed.

But along the way, my relationship with food was obliterated. In combination with my psych meds *which are notorious for crazy weight gain* and now an insatiable desire to eat, and eat, and eat (probably to make myself feel better) I've gained at least 40 lbs in the span of 6 months. 

So now I feel even worse because I feel like I look like a bowling ball and my clothes are very hard to fit into. To make matters worse, people are commenting on my weight. Which we all know is a big NO NO. Even my Nana told me ""you should stop eating or you're gonna get EVEN fatter' I've been trying so hard to hold myself together because I literally hate myself and it seems like everyone else does to. I have never felt more ugly and unsatisfied with myself.

So all in all, I know it's going to be hard to lose the weight I gained due to psych meds, WHILE on psych meds. But I need a healthy way to lose the weight without purging. First step is to stop binging so I don't have to purge. 

Therfore, does anyone have any tips on how to feel full and satisfied with the amount and type of food I'm eating???          I don't want to binge and purge, but I don't want to put myself back into the cycle of not eating at all.

,bulimia,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this group, sorry if this ends up being a long post but I guess I just want to vent and I'd love to speak to people who understand.

I'm a 28 yr old girl and had problems with anorexia as a teenager. In my 20s it transformed into bulimia which has been on and off for the past maybe 10 years. For the past maybe 5 years, it's not been a serious problem apart from the occasional one-off relapse. For the past year before i came to Japan i don't recall having a single episode.

I moved to Japan for work about a month ago. Since then the bulimia has come back in a pretty bad way. I think the reason is a combination of stress from moving /new job , plus i think the circumstances of being in Japan have played a part:

1. Amazing food is everywhere here, and so convenient. It's cheaper to eat out than to cook at home, and there are cheap restaurants everywhere and always open. I have lived in a hotel until recently and even now I don't have a fridge yet so perfect excuse to eat out all the time. I will maybe eat out somewhere on a whim, decided i ate too much and make a ""plan"" to b/p, essentially restaurant hop have a bunch more food until i feel sick then find a nice private toilet to puke. Which brings me to my second point..

2. There are nice clean public toilets everywhere. No matter where i am i can easily find a nice toilet with a lot of privacy to purge in. Means i also don't have to worry about making my toilet at home dirty.

3. There are convenience stores everywhere and all open 24 hours. I could decide to b/p at 4am and get any kind of food i want from a store 2 mins walk away. All kinds of delicious ready made meals, sweets and cakes etc. Also for example, if I have a big meal and feel full, even if it wasnt a planned b/p, maybe i decide I ate too much, go and buy some ice cream and cake and milk, make myself fully stuffed and purge easily.

Plus, I now live alone, so I don't have anyone to hide it from. I'm still settling in and have a lot of worries and stress. My apartment is completely unfurnished still so it's quite depressing. I'm not b/ping every day. I'm actively trying not to. But I'm gaining weight and it's hard to deal with. Japanese people eat a lot and huge portions and never seem to gain weight. Plus, i know Japan has a reputation for healthy food but tbh a lot of the food is very high in carbs and oil. 

I hate this. I'm trying not to beat myself up too much and tell myself it's just stress but i don't know if it's gonna go away. 

Overall I'm having a good time here. Things are going well. But this is something dark lurking in the corner and i can't ignore it any more!! I should be enjoying all the amazing food here but this is making me unable to!

Thank you for listening. If you have similar feelings i am happy to listen xxx

I should add that I studied in Japan for a year at university, and it was a very bad year for me.

My name is Hana Zickgraf, and I'm an assistant professor of psychology at the[ University of South Alabama](https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/psychology/faculty/zickgraf.html). I study eating disorders, and with some colleagues at Yale University and Penn State/Hershey College of Medicine, I recently developed a questionnaire measuring accommodation of eating disorders. Accommodation happens when someone close to a person with an eating disorder changes their own behavior in order to reduce the stress of the person with an eating disorder, or to help manage their symptoms. Accommodation is done out of a desire to help, but sometimes it can have negative consequences, including caregiver burnout or slowing the recovery of the person with the eating disorder.

,bulimia,"Hi everyone. 

I lost 50 kg (almost 100 lbs) over 2 years with clean eating and exercise \[everything from cardio to weights to yoga\]. I am strong, toned, flexible and very good-looking 27y female now. 

I started on the bulimia path when i was losing weight and suddenly there would be a family party where I would be required to eat, or want to eat all the tasty cakes and fried things. I would then eat, and drink water/coke alongside to make it all come up easier. I developed this as a habit, I would keep track of it and I was not indulging in this for more than 4 times a month. I thought I was ok. My weight came down, I was no longer morbidly obese. I got a good boyfriend. I am marrying him this year. I tried sharing this with him, but he saw it as a good way to eat and not gain weight and laughed at it until I told him how I am nursing my very own special ED and I should probably get help because by this time I was also scared at how I was becoming too reliant on this. 

Coming to this week, I have puked my guts out every day for one meal - a normal family meal, not more than 500 calories, no fried stuff, just everyday food - because I have not been working out due to sciatica in my left leg. I cannot even walk more than 10 steps, I am getting physical therapy since a week but it will continue till this week and even then, I cannot work out at max capacity for two more weeks. 

I am scared. I am asking for help here. I have been trying to eat little as possible every day. I am scared the weight will come back and I will wake up 108 kg again, and all the love and adoration and compliments I received and continue to get from every one will once again disappear. 

I do not need preachers or sermons, I need a way out. Any words would be appreciated.

EDIT- UPDATE - Thank you to everyone who replied. 
My pain is much better now (after a week). Doc has okayed some yoga and daily walks which I will be starting today. I still get jarring pain in my leg sometimes out of the blue so lifting and cardio is out of the picture probably for the rest of June. 
After I posted, I have refrained from purging. I compensated by having a low-cal breakfast and then eating with my family for lunch, and a low-key dinner again. This way I made room for food and didn’t purge at all in the past 3 days tho I really wanted to (esp since a gathering we had which involved fried food). So it’s getting better. 🤞🏼🤞🏼

I tried sharing this with him, but he saw it as a good way to eat and not gain weight and laughed at it until I told him how I am nursing my very own special ED and I should probably get help because by this time I was also scared at how I was becoming too reliant on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to this week, I have puked my guts out every day for one meal - a normal family meal, not more than 500 calories, no fried stuff, just everyday food - because I have not been working out due to sciatica in my left leg. I cannot even walk more than 10 steps, I am getting physical therapy since a week but it will continue till this week and even then, I cannot work out at max capacity for two more weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am scared. I am asking for help here. I have been trying to eat little as possible every day. I am scared the weight will come back and I will wake up 108 kg again, and all the love and adoration and compliments I received and continue to get from every one will once again disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not need preachers or sermons, I need a way out. Any words would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT- UPDATE - Thank you to everyone who replied. 
My pain is much better now (after a week). Doc has okayed some yoga and daily walks which I will be starting today. I still get jarring pain in my leg sometimes out of the blue so lifting and cardio is out of the picture probably for the rest of June. 
After I posted, I have refrained from purging. I compensated by having a low-cal breakfast and then eating with my family for lunch, and a low-key dinner again. This way I made room for food and didn’t purge at all in the past 3 days tho I really wanted to (esp since a gathering we had which involved fried food). So it’s getting better. 🤞🏼🤞🏼
Thank you all again.&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"Hello, everyone! 

I recently joined this subreddit, and I’m already finding it helpful. Eating disorders are so often shrouded in secrecy, so it helps to have a space to share stories and experiences. 

I struggled with anorexia as a child, after my mother died when I was eleven. I was in and out of hospitals and residential treatment, then in “full recovery” for a couple of years, then fell into a ten-year cycle of binging and restricting that started in college. 

Since becoming a mother six years ago, I’ve done better in my recovery. I’m farther along than I ever imagined I’d be, but I still live with the disorder’s imprints. I’m in what I like to call “the middle place” — that liminal space between sickness and full recovery. 

I’m writing a memoir about my experiences, and though the book is primarily about my own story, I’m also talking with others about their experiences so that I can broaden my scope of understanding. It’s important to me to be mindful of the range of experiences that people face when struggling with, or in recovery from, an eating disorder. 

Along these lines, I’ve created a brief survey that I’m sharing with people who have experienced eating disorders. The questions are optional, and the information will be kept confidential. I would love it if those of you in this group would be willing to fill it out. The link is here: http://shorturl.at/mpCE4

**""But you do not look sick?""**

Well, you do not look like an idiot, but here we are🤪 kidding, heheh ..

Eating disorders are mental disorders, not cultural phenomena .. and unfortunately, I sincerely believe that, when most people hear the word «eating disorder», images appear in the head of skinny and tired bodies .. and it is so sad, because it is so much more, there is so much more behind .. there are different types of eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, arphide, overeating disorder etc .. and no, you can not always see that you are sick ..

It's not easy to see that I struggle with food .. I am ""normal weight"" (whatever that means), and I have never been particularly thin .. I eat in expected situations, and I like to talk about how good the food is .. but; food is my weakness .. a love-hate relationship .. I hate food. And I love food. .. I want to feel in control, which is the opposite of what I feel now .. but there is so much food does for me .. comfort, reward (or punishment), distraction, anxiety suppressant and the intense emptiness inside me is filled , ""Intoxication"", joy, pastime, if only for a little while .. ""it is good to see that you have such a good appetite"" .. well, food is not always pleasurable, but more like a compulsion .. a prison .. but because I might look a little bigger (yes, quite true, but I'm built that way, and it's totally okay), no one suspects I'm struggling with food .. besides, I think as little as possible about myself myself, hoping to take up a little less space, and I think it works, because I am not seen .. I am so ""big"" that I am invisible .. often I think that, maybe if I had been as small as I feel me, then it would be easier, but no ..

no matter how much I want help, our dear mental health care sees eating disorders as something physical .. all that is grilled in the head is weight and BMI .. ""you are not sick enough"", and hey we were back to not looks sick .. no, I do not look sick, but I will promise you that this disorder will soon suffocate me to death, it just does not seem ..

,bulimia,"So I'm a 169cm (5'7"") 22F that, while on birth control, used to weight around 48-50kg (105-110 lbs). I stopped birth control around a year ago and in the last 7-8month I've gained around 10kg.

I guess it's not only the birth control but also the fact that I came to live in a new country alone (due to an exchange), I'm finishing my career and I'm also having some really stressful problems related to relationship and my migratory state.

This combination of factors made me start eating a lot more than I used to and now, as I said, 10kg after, I don't recognize my body. I hate it, I feel absolutely fat and ugly and the fact that my old clothes don't fit me anymore doesn't help at all.

Anyway, today my father brought me a bag of chocolate croissants for breakfast. They were around 8 croissants (medium size). 

Well, I ended up eating them all within 10 minutes and then felt so guilty and bad about myself. Yesterday I had told myself that today I was gonna do better, I mean, I was gonna eat more consciously and healthily.

I felt so bad about myself that I decided to try and vomit all of what I had eaten. I once tried it (years ago) but didn't like it. Today though, it was so easy and made me feel so good. I puked more than half of what I ate. At the same time, it made me feel guilty because this way of dealing with such problem is a coward move. So I told myself to stop and get out of the bathroom but other part of me was saying ""just one more, one more and you'll feel better. One more and you'll win a free pass to eat lunch"".

I lost 60 pounds healthily by calorie counting and exercise in 2020..  then in November 2020 I made myself throw up when I felt sick after eating an ice cream bar.. then it was like a lightbulb went off, I realized I could maintain my weight loss while still being able to eat as much junk as I wanted, as long as I threw it up :(

It started as an occasional thing and then it became 4-5 times a week, sometimes a couple times a day. People would be like, ""You have done such a great job keeping the weight off, you're so disciplined"" ughhh I was a complete fraud.

,bulimia," Hi!

You may have seen a similar post to this some weeks ago looking for participants for a research project. The research project is now officially starting with a survey and interviews hence why I am posting it again - now with links :-)

Are you 18 years of age or older and do you frequent any type of social media related to self-harm?

My name is Leah. I am currently working with my university on a research project about self-harm and online communities. We're interested in openly exploring thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to self-harming, including what it’s like to be part of an online community where such thoughts, feelings, and experiences are shared. An online community may be a Facebook group, an Instagram account, a Twitter account, a Tumblr account, a sub-Reddit, a website, or any other social media forum or online message board focused on or often relating to self-harm content. 

We are hoping that you may be interested in participating in this study in order to help scientists, psychologists, doctors, and others to better understand self-harm so that we may better be able to help those who seek help for behaviour, thoughts, and feelings related to self-harm.

The study consists of two parts: a questionnaire and an interview and you may participate in either one or both of these. 

* **The** **questionnaire**: This [link](https://www.sdu.dk/da/forskning/videnscenter_for_psykotraumatologi/projekt+om+koensforskelle+i+traumereaktioner) will take you to a secure website which contains detailed participant information including information on the study and how your data is treated. If you wish to participate in the study after having read this, you may continue directly to the questionnaire from there. You may skip questions that you do not wish to answer. You may exit the questionnaire at any time you wish, but you will not be able to return. Upon having finished the questionnaire you will be asked if you wish to join an online presentation of the main findings once the study has concluded. If you wish to do so, you will be given the option to share your e-mail in a new window so that it cannot be linked to your questionnaire responses. If you provide us with your email address, you will receive an invitation to the presentation at a later time. No individual data will be shared. 
* **The** **interview**: I will be the one conducting the interviews on an online secure connection. The interviews are confidential and no identifiable information will be shared. The interview will be carried out in an informal manner with your comfort as my main priority. There are no right or wrong answers and you may deny to answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable or leave the interview at any time. If you are interested or even just a little curious, you can contact the project leader at [dochristiansen@health.sdu.dk](mailto:dochristiansen@health.sdu.dk). She will then answer any questions that you may have about the project and provide you with my e-mail address to set up a time for the interview. Please make sure not to include any sensitive personal information in the e-mail, as we cannot ensure a secure connection at both ends. Prior to starting the interview itself I will tell you about the interview and answer any questions you may have. We will only begin the interview if and when you feel comfortable to do so. The interview will be recorded but only the audio will be saved. I will have my camera on during the interview unless you prefer for me not to. It is up to you whether you prefer to have yours on or off.

We understand that this topic can be highly sensitive, and your safety and comfort are our highest priority. You may exit the questionnaire or interview at any time. Any information you choose to share with us will be treated respectfully and confidentially in accordance with European law on data regulation (GDPR) and ethical guidelines for research (you can read more about this on the secure website).

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in participating in or if you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact the project leader Dr. Dorte M. Christiansen. We will do our best to answer any questions you may have. Please make sure to not include any personal information in your email. 

All participants who are interested will be given the opportunity to participate in an online presentation of the study’s main findings once data collection has completed. 

We thank you for your time and hope very much that you will decide to participate. 

Best wishes,

,bulimia,"Hey everyone, as part of my doctoral thesis\* I've developed a questionnaire to shed some light on how guilt, shame and blame impacts the loved ones of someone with mental health needs. If you provide (or know someone who provides) informal mental health support and notice these emotions showing up in the relationship, I would really appreciate hearing from you.

People who have completed the survey have reported finding the differences between guilt and shame insightful and highlighted how it helped them understand more about their emotional experience in the relationship.

The whole survey takes around 15-20 minutes and after understanding more about your current emotional state, it goes through a range of scenarios to see how you would likely respond if it were to happen today. All answers are scales so there is minimal typing and it is mobile friendly.

If you provide (or know someone who provides) informal mental health support and notice these emotions showing up in the relationship, I would really appreciate hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have completed the survey have reported finding the differences between guilt and shame insightful and highlighted how it helped them understand more about their emotional experience in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole survey takes around 15-20 minutes and after understanding more about your current emotional state, it goes through a range of scenarios to see how you would likely respond if it were to happen today. All answers are scales so there is minimal typing and it is mobile friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently in (on/off) ana/mia recovery since January last year after being disordered for about 6 years. Lately I've manged to purge a lot less (went from 3 times/day to max. 1 time/week). However, when I do eat, I always experience dizzyness and often faint after being able to get down a meal. I experienced this back in 2019 already, when I was, anorexia-wise, at my lowest point. I thought it would be panic and a reaction of stress but now in recovery, I (thankfully) have less and less stress while eating. I also had dizzyness and fainted when I wasn't able to eat like I do now, but instead of building up slowly (or at some point just being consistantly dizzy), I faint more suddenly now despite me having more energy overall.  
I also had bigger meals lately as well because I've gained enough confidence to eat them and keeping them down.

,bulimia,"Hi, everyone!

First of all, I would like to say I came close, but I never actually developed bulimia. All information I know is based on my perception of it based on what I read or used to want to do, and although I might understand some common feelings due to other mental health issues (the inner guilt and shame, the whole ""I want to tell people, but I want nobody to know"" kind of thing), I have no direct experience to know for sure what living with bulimia is like.

To sum everything up, I (F22) suspect one of my friends (M23) has bulimia. I don't want to be too triggering in a public post or risk being found out, but there are a lot of small behaviors that when are put together are causing me some concern. I'm not even sure if some of them are risk signs or if everything is just a bunch of coincidences and it's just some snowball effect of thinking there's a story where there actually isn't one. (Even if everyone is different, if someone would be willing to listen in private and tell me what they think based on their personal experience, it would really mean a lot to me.)

Anyways, I'm not sure if I should discuss this issue with them. We're not best friends and don't spend much time together and we met only a few months ago, but I still care about him and he's still a person. If I happen to talk about it and it turns out to be false, then that's the best case scenario and I'm not too concerned with their reaction. What I'm afraid of is talking about it and it being true, even if he happens to lie and hide it from me (which is okay) - is there anything I could say (or not) to make them feel welcomed and not too ashamed or guilty? Should I even say something at all, since it's not something I can directly improve and could instead end making him feel self-conscious, alone and overall worse? Since he's a guy and it's rare to talk in media about the experiences of men with a eating disorder, and even if we're all human, I'm also a bit worried if there's something I should keep in mind while talking to him, or if this would affect his reaction because of fear of not being ""masculine"".

,bulimia,"My husband and I were over at our friends house for dinner. Our friends know I have a history of bulimia, but never have shared that it's current. I relapsed a couple years ago and am very secretive about it and only confide in my therapist, my dad and close girlfriend. The way I see it, I've been in treatment so many times in the past and just don't think anyone else needs to know. Our one friend asked my husband after we hung out if I was throwing up again. He told him that he noticed I'd gone to bathroom right after dinner and thought he heard me throwing up. My husband said to him that I probably wasn't cause I would most likely confide in him. 

Firstly, I am so embarrassed. I love our friends and I knew something was off with him (our friend) and I that night. I sensed he was bothered by something cause he kept looking at me weird and questioningly. I am so ashamed and feel so out of control that I threw up at their house and now he ""knows"" how crazy and messed up I am. 

Secondly, when my husband asked me about it I lied. I didn't tell him and I told him that I wasn't throwing up. I feel guilty for not sharing with him and hiding it from him and lying, but I also don't know how to tell him that I've been struggling and don't want to give up my control or have him shun me or something.

I looked up on Google if it had to do with my ED and apparently a lot of bulimic individuals and individuals like me who have AN b/p experience buccal swelling (saliva muscles etc). Does anyone know how to reduce the swelling?&lt;/p&gt;

,bulimia,"
In my early teens, my weight started bothering me. I wasn’t getting the same attention from girls as my friends. They had never been as chubby as me, always lean and nimble. Eventually, feelings of ineptitude and inferiority slowly simmered into self hatred. At around 14 or so I decided I’d had enough, and worked my way towards losing weight the “healthy way”. 
I read up on nutrition science, exercised weekly and even started PT. 
Progress was slow, but consistent; and eventually people had started to notice a positive change in both my appearance and mood. I felt athletic, and progressively built confidence. However, I couldn’t help but notice how little the person I saw reflected in my mirror changed…

My love handles where too prominent, my jawline wasn’t cut enough, my chest was too large, my arms where too chubby. Kilo after kilo I dropped and yet something was always wrong. I thought that if the mirror lied than maybe the scale could be more trustworthy. I frankly became addicted to seeing that number trickle downward. I obsessed over every calorie. One day, during the summer vacation, I had eaten a little too much of a rich desert. I felt nauseous, sick. So I did something impulsive to make better. I stuck two fingers down my throat and I made myself puke. What shocked me was how easily it all came up. No gut wrenching tremor, no involuntary convulsions or tears. One second it was in my stomach, the next, spread out across a secluded bush behind the family house. 

From there my already fragile and obsessive relationship to food changed completely. What started off as a rare, last resort answer, became something I did nearly daily. It got to the point where I would ritualize the process, making sure to minimize the harshness of the acid reflux by timing the purge; drinking plenty of fluids after and even taking a teaspoon of honey to stabilize my glucose levels. It was almost as if this “damage control” helped mentally sway the guilt of what I was doing. 

By this point, I had gone from 106 kg, to around 73 in less than 1 year and half. Having always been much taller than average, my skin had started to stretch thinly across my bones, my rib cage was for the first time fully visible. My spine could be felt through the fabric of my shirts. One time my mother hugged me and exclaimed that it was like embracing a sack of bones. Another time, someone said I looked like a concentration camp inmate. The truly dark part about all this, is I still remember feeling a burning sense of pride and accomplishment in those moments. But the work was not done yet… no my love handles where still too prominent, my jawline not cut chest too large, and arms too chubby. The person I saw in the mirror wasn’t who I would later come to see in pictures, many years later. 

The reason I’ve decided to write this is to show you that I’ve been to the depths many still struggle with. To tell there is a way out, a light at the end of whatever tunnels you might be burrowing through. I made mistakes. I never told anyone about my binge and purge cycles. Everyone I knew and loved just assumed I was just diligent in my nutritional programming. You don’t need to make these same mistakes. Talk to people you can trust, express to them your feelings which haunt you daily. Because even if the road to recovery can be marked with relapse, sacrifice and even failure, nobody’s fate is truly sealed. 
I changed my relationship to food. I changed my relationship to my body, and what strength and beauty it was capable of. Through this process I discovered body building. Today I’m a healthy, 6’3 103 kg aspiring body builder, who hasn’t purged in almost 3 years, and doesn’t ever plan to again. 

My advice to all of you is to find something  productive through which to catalyse and channel the thoughts and emotions which perpetuate your current situation. Only you can know what form this will take, but always remember that it needs to come from you. No amount of therapy, medicine or even affection can fix what you are unwilling to change.

I wanted to cry.

I wasn’t restricting that day- but I wanted to eat in a slight caloric deficit. I already roughly pre calculated the calories for the day and two servings kept me well below my caloric goal.

,bulimia,"I apologize in advance for the long post, but I feel it is necessary to talk about it.

I have been living with bulimia for almost 4 years now. ""Trauma"" was the reason that made me ""develop"" bulimia. I believe bulimia is the way I ended up expressing depression.

Had great a childhood and life until the Trauma happened (around 24 yrs old). I considered myself to be ""normal"" before then. 

At my worst with bulimia, I started to lose connections with people that cared about me. It was a vicious cycle of isolation and b/p. 

\- - - that went on for maybe 1 year - - -   

I saw a turning point when I first looked for professional help at my university (during my master's). That is when my mentality fully changed. I tried medication (Prozac), but a month into it, I threw it away. I had noticed that Prozac was a quick fix, it helped me for a little while. Over time, I needed higher and higher doses to sustain its effects. Prozac helped, but it did not fix the root cause of my issues, thus I removed it from my system. 

A month after seeking help, I was hopeful and thought to myself that I would go back to being my normal self really soon. I hate to break to you, but you will NEVER go back to normal. Bulimia will be always in the background, even after recovery"". Just embrace that reality, it will help you with your recovery.

**Triggers**

Intuitively, I started to take note of my triggers during my best periods. I have made everything  I could to stay away from them. My triggers involve foods and environments. I live alone, I do not hold food in the bulky at home, and some foods I do not buy at all bc they really trigger me to binge. Believe me, those foods are as basic as bread. I allow myself to have it when I am around friends/family. 

**Binging and purging**

That has been wild. I went from a really aggressive binging mentality (I do not care if I die) to a lot of ""healthier"" type of binging/purging. Where I made sure I hydrated during and after it. Nowadays, If I feel I will go binging, I have a ""set"" of foods that are easier on me during the process. I also, do not binge to my limit. Sometimes, just the fact of purging something brings me relaxation and decreases my anxiety. 

**Minimalist food choices**

This has been a recent game changer. I was watching a youtube video from Matt D'Avela, nothing related to eating disorders. But at this specific episode (I will leave the link at the end of this thread), he was talking about how he ate the same thing everyday bc because that decreases the stress associated with making food choices, and it speeds up the entire process. I loved the idea of these minimalistic food choices. Sometime, deciding what to eat causes me great stress, bc I do not want to do something that drives me to a binge. Using that approach, I have found a breakfast and dinner that has helped me greatly. Those meals have a balanced combination of protein, carbs, and fat. They also provide me with quality and enough calories. It has been working for 2 weeks, so I will keep doing it and see what happens. 

**Exercise**

I have a troublesome relationship with exercise. It is almost a must at this point. Any type of exercise helps, but there is an intensity and length I try to achieve. I also mix up exercises from biking/hiking/walking/weight lifting. If I do not exercise for 2 days in a row, there is a serious issue. 3 days is a guarantee that shit will hit the fan behavior-wise. 

**Facial Massages post binge**

I do not like how my face gets all puffy after a binge. To prevent me from b/p riding in the ""fuck it"" mentality, I massage my face the subsequent day's post binge. It helps me have the ""look"" that I enjoy and strengthens my spirits to avoid a binge. 

SUMMARY

It has been a journey, honestly.... a lot longer than I thought It would be. It is much better than a year ago, but I still have a looooong way to go with recovery. By the way, the doctor I saw in college was the only help I sought throughout this process. I learned a lot on my own. Honestly, I think talking with a psychologist is extremely helpful, but it is a luxury I cannot financially afford right now.

If you are just starting your recovery journey, be advised it will take a long time, and it will not be easy. You have to be mindful of your choices foodwise and behavior-wise (drinking always leads to bingeing for me).

Hang in there because there is still hope. s2

,bulimia,"Hello everyone. I'm new to this community, having bulimia starting after a very traumatic breakup. I'm a 19 year old girl that went from 140 pounds to 119 in a month, and in that month, my eating habits have been all over the place. The first week I hardly ate anything at all, estimated at maybe 400-600 calories a day because I simply could not force myself to eat. The following week was a little better, with my parents forcing me to at least eat a complete meal at the end of the day. 

But the third week was where the monitoring started. I was diagnosed with bulimia from a drop in nutrients and acute body dysmorphia because of my newly found insecurities with gaining back that weight. I'd start to look at old pictures of myself and cringe, then quickly compare how flat my stomach was to my old, healthy fat. With all these attributes on top of the breakup, I was miserable. Still am.

I then began dieting. Up to 1000-1200 calories per day, with fatty acids and protein being the things that pushed me through. I cut carbs and sugars, because I figured those were the things that would hurt me. 

Cut to a week later. I'm absolutely starving, 119 pounds now edging 118, and I'm at work trying not to have a breakdown because though I'm tiny I'm suffering. After work I buy Cook Out and binge on several items high in calories and fat. 

And now it's the next day and the guilt is eating me raw. I'm bloated, and feel as if I gained ten pounds, can't poop, and literally am on my bathroom floor crying. 

This is eating me away and I don't know how to handle it :(

The first week I hardly ate anything at all, estimated at maybe 400-600 calories a day because I simply could not force myself to eat. The following week was a little better, with my parents forcing me to at least eat a complete meal at the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the third week was where the monitoring started. I was diagnosed with bulimia from a drop in nutrients and acute body dysmorphia because of my newly found insecurities with gaining back that weight. I&amp;#39;d start to look at old pictures of myself and cringe, then quickly compare how flat my stomach was to my old, healthy fat. With all these attributes on top of the breakup, I was miserable. Still am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then began dieting. Up to 1000-1200 calories per day, with fatty acids and protein being the things that pushed me through. I cut carbs and sugars, because I figured those were the things that would hurt me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a week later. I&amp;#39;m absolutely starving, 119 pounds now edging 118, and I&amp;#39;m at work trying not to have a breakdown because though I&amp;#39;m tiny I&amp;#39;m suffering. After work I buy Cook Out and binge on several items high in calories and fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;#39;s the next day and the guilt is eating me raw. I&amp;#39;m bloated, and feel as if I gained ten pounds, can&amp;#39;t poop, and literally am on my bathroom floor crying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is eating me away and I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle it :(&lt;/p&gt;

However, the reason why I am not fully recovered is because sometimes I still b/p. I used to p after I would eat at a restaurant or eat unsafe foods, but now I only do it when I'm really stressed/anxious. For example, if I get in trouble at work (or have a fight with a parent/SO, or lose my wallet lol--just anything that stresses me out), I will go to the store, b a ton, and then p. It really is an emotional response that I cannot control rather than a ""oh I'm going to p because this food will make me gain weight"" type of thing like I used to do.

,bulimia,"does anyone else feel invalid in their bulimia because they don't present stereotypically?

Now, I fit the bulimia stereotype at some points, as given by the DSM-V. But when not looking at me physically, it doesn't seem like I have bulimia at all. I don't tend to purge through normal means and it makes me feel like shit. I know that it's bulimia because it's defined by the goddamn DSM-V but I still feel fake because I'm not what people think of as bulimic.

I don't tend to purge through vomitting often. My emetophobia (fear of throwing up) is pretty severe, so it's an additional layer of hell when I do vomit, on top of the normal shitty feeling of making yourself puke. I get really shivery and scared when I do it, and it's not something I can do often. I don't use lax due to a pretty traumatic medical history -- long story short, I don't trust any sort of pills. Nor do I want to shit myself in public, which keeps me from using lax teas 'n' shit.

Most of my purging is in the form of fasting and over exercise. I'll not eat for days or hours, until I inevitably binge again. I'll work myself to feeling faint and almost deathly (which isn't hard, since I'm chronically ill) and then I'll work myself some more. I don't see a lot of people online talking about this sort of bulimia -- purging through exessive fasting or exercise. I know it's purging as defined by the DSM-V, but I still feel like I'm faking it, like I'm not sick enough. And when I do find people talking about comp exercise it's usually gym bros, whom I struggle to relate to.

I also binge way more than i purge. I can binge like 4-5 times a week and purge like 3-4 times. I just feel fake and I hate it. Does anyone else present like this? I just want to know that I'm not alone.

My husband and I are separated. We are still in communications and I love him but we can’t live together due to his mental illness.

It was also mostly upset me that my partner was so mean and grumpy when I was having night terrors visiting his place, considering we’re long distance and I was trying really hard to be well behaved and helpful. I recently saw 2 online friends who are emaciated and really wish I could hug em. I’m also envious wish I could numb myself but it doesn’t work with the lifestyle I have. In someways it’s difficult that I experience intense love and have things I don’t want to lose and things I want to achieve more so than looking emaciated.&lt;/p&gt;
