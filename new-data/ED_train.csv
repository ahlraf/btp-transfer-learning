i’ve struggled with an eating disorder for over a year now, and I was diagnosed with anorexia 5 months ago.

I feel like i’m in some sort of danger. I don’t fit into some of my clothes anymore, and it’s making me want to relapse. my thoughts won’t stop and it is genuinely torturous. I don’t want to ruin august for myself by worrying about food and I also don’t want to hate the way I look and feel awful. but at this point it’s too late. I wish I could be happy again.

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams I am a Graduate student at Rogers State University, and I am doing a research project on eating disorders for males. More specifically if there is some type of trauma in your childhood is there an increased risk of developing an eating disorder in the male population. Males have been overlooked for a long time in this research and I want to change that. This is completely confidential, no personal identifiers are asked nor shared. 

You can stop at any time if you feel triggered or uncomfortable. I am looking for 

300 males to complete my 2 surveys which should take between 10-15 minutes. Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope to shed more light on this subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link which you will read and sign the informed consent, then continue towards the surveys. Have a great day.

i feel like I'm stuck in a rut, binge, restrict, binge, restrict, and even that time where i thought i had everything under control and i was eating normally for a while of course it went downhill, i ended up bingeing again, and eating anything started to become stressful again, I've been trying to get back on my schedule of 3 meals a day and eating something every 3-4 hours but it's just difficult now

whenever i eat or feel hungry i feel disgusting and gluttonous 

i only see my therapist once every two weeks, and i can't ask for that to increase because my parents will ask why and if they know about all of this they'll just make it so much worse

one of my new pe curriculum's primary focuses is weight, and i asked my therapist about getting alternative assignments when there was an activity about it but she said she needs parental permission to contact the school. even though she can give me a letter to give to the school, im scared that the school will need parental permission to alter my lessons and assignments 


I've joined 5 different vent-based discord servers and they've all done one of 4 things:

""if you're overweight up your exercise and start dieting"", i already exercise for a huge part of the day, and i have too many issues with eating to be able to effectively diet, but nobody actually wants to help me with those

""you need to learn to love yourself"", i don't know *how*. That's part of what I'm seeking help on. But nobody wants to help me, they just want to tell me what i already know 

i once got ENCOURAGED by FOUR PEOPLE to restrict

or they just don't ever respond to anything i post.


i went on tumblr for any kind of help, i was in for a ride awakening. It's all pro-ana shit or fetishization. There's a bot that came up, kokobot, but it says that it's not a safe place to talk about eds. I don't know why it popped up while i was searching various ed terms or why it has an option for eating disorders when it asks you what you're struggling with then, but it did. There are a few helpful tips there but they're all for anorexia and i think binge eating is my big problem rn

And it's funny how whenever i talk about this stuff everyone always says ""it doesn't matter what others think of you, beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" but then i talk about how other people only ever talk about how I'm so beautiful or whatever and i just don't like the way i look, they say ""everyone thinks you're beautiful, so you must be"" or something along those lines. It makes me feel so invalidated, people only want to contrast my opinion of myself, and it makes me frustrated. Imagine telling the truth and everyone just keeps insisting you're lying. That's how it feels. 

What's more, r/EatingDisorders apparently doesn't allow fucking cries for help. I feel so, so rejected.

,eating_disorders,"these past few months I’ve noticed a decline in the amount of food I’m eating. I was a chubby kid and I generally had problems with my parents saying I shouldn’t be eating so much. I used to think they were just being cautious and I spent most of my youth eating quite a lot of food thinking not much of it.

But these past few years, especially during the height of the covid pandemic I would often skip meals or only have them in smaller quantities than what I was used to. I didn’t think much of it and just got through the pandemic.

But then when we started to get back to normal I started skipping breakfast and started heading to school earlier. My father told me that I need to eat breakfast before heading to school as it would keep my energy up for the day but I ignored him and continue to do this for months. I think the first time when I started to realise that this is a problem was in late February when after school I would sit waiting around for my clubs, after school hours they did these evening meals I would often feel guilty about eating these evening meals and then I would not finish my dish.

I then stopped eating my packed lunches and I would often throw away my sandwiches into the bin and only have a small bunch of grapes to last me for the entire day. It’s not that I was forcing myself not to eat it’s just I didn’t feel hungry I didn’t feel hungry for anything I didn’t want to eat because I didn’t feel the need to eat. Then start to happen on weekends. so I will go being tidy sleeping for about 11 hours and then coming downstairs for a small piece of toast and then going up to my room and not coming down until 8 p.m.

This carried on for months and the point where I realised this is an actual problem is when my school had a talent show and I refused to eat anything all day I did not have anything that day. This is when I realised that I probably have a problem and recently it’s come to light that in fact I probably do because I this past week have been skipping almost every single meal of the day and just drinking water supplies I’ve stopped brushing my teeth I stop heading to bed at a normal time. I sometimes go to bed with my stomach growling and then wake up the next morning with a growling but not leaving my room until about three hours later when I’m at the point of serious stomach pains.

I don’t want to get my parents involved because I think they’ll say I’m overreacting about this but I honestly don’t know what to do and how I can stop this before it becomes an eating disorder.

long story short, i want to recover because im tired and exhausted and im worrying my family, but i dont know where to start getting professional help.

long story long, my ed seriously started in october 2021. i have lost a fair amount of weight since then and went from a healthy weight to being underweight. a couple months in, my parents started getting really worried because they had noticed me skipping meals and losing weight quickly, so they kept a close eye on me which forced me to... ""recover"". lets just say, my mindset around food did not change a bit, and whenever i ate ""unhealthy"" foods or just bigger portions, i would still feel awful and beat myself up over it. still though, i ate, and so after a while my parents thought it was over and i was better.
i relapsed really badly when i noticed they stopped caring. i noticed my weight gain and began restricting heavily again, going to more extreme measures than before. this also went on for a couple months, bringing us to today.
as i was making my breakfast, my mom came up to me and said she was worried because i looked so thin - i usually wear baggy clothes, today i wore a regular shirt. she started tracing my bones etc through my shirt and i could tell it really upset her. later, she sat me down and had a big long talk with me about my relationship with food, and whether i was losing weight on purpose. eventually i gave in and finally started being honest about it, in a very diluted way - i did not go into detail but i mentioned that maybe i do restrict to become skinnier. she asked me if ive talked about it to my therapist, which i havent - unfortunately, my therapist is on vacation this entire month, so even if i wanted to, i couldnt get professional help from her. my mom offered to take me to a local mental health clinic if things got too bad. i know this is really worrying and stressful to her, especially because she was pretty much oblivious to it for a long time, and now its this whole serious situation that i didnt even want it to become.
anyways, i told her id be fine on my own for now, but im not so sure if thats true. i have been considering recovery for a good while now. i hate that the only thing on my mind is food, i hate that i cannot enjoy any events at any time of day because im constantly worried about what im going to be eating. i miss food and i miss having fun and i miss not caring. and now, on top of that, i have the added burden of being the problem child and worrying my lovely and supportive parents for what feels like no good reason if i continue my disordered behavior.
so at this point, i want to recover. but i dont think i can do this alone, at home, with no supervision or professional help whatsoever. sure, i could wait until my therapist is back, but she doesnt even know about all of this. itll be overwhelming and take long enough to even tell her, and i dont think anything will come from it immediately. but i dont know if i can keep living like this at this point in time, i feel awful, my family feels awful, i feel so exhausted from just everything.
however, i feel like if i went to this nearby clinic, i wouldnt be sick enough to receive any treatment. im so, so afraid that im making way too big of a deal out of this, and that theyd dismiss me and send me back home because, i dont know, maybe i look healthy enough or maybe they dont consider someone who eats two meals a day as anorexic, because theres people who eat less.
i also have no idea of what to expect if i go there. all i really want for now is to talk to someone about it and see what they have to say from a professional standpoint, but i dont know whether theyd just prescribe me calorie supplements, or if id receive treatment and have to stay there, or if id just be sent home and be just as clueless and hopeless as before.

But the question is: Can two people with eating disorders be friends?

I have battled with disordered eating on and off throughout my life. I'm in my early 40s now. You'd think I would have this figured out by now.  About 4 years ago, I dropped down to a dangerously low weight. But, as so many of us have experienced, the ""you're too skinny"" was a welcome compliment. I was accomplishing something. I was proud of my xylophone ribs (and all the rest). I relished my routine of exercise, eating ""clean,"" wearing tiny sizes. I've had a lot of shift in the last year and started to slow down on the exercising, eat more normally. It's part of my pattern. At some point, the heart palpitations and aching bones just suck. I can't keep up the rigor of that routine. But it's not that I don't want to...which is the disordered part.My best friend of 20+ years decided she wanted to get a ""Revenge bod"" last summer. And I saw all the signs; obsessive exercise, tracking her weight on her bathroom mirror, eating little to nothing, getting angry when other people weren't eating, getting angry when anyone questioned her behavior. Ostensibly, she says she is the ""healthiest she's ever been"" -- yes, training for a marathon while also, you know, smoking. But worse, is that it is all she talks about; how much weight she's lost, how much she's exercising, her ""veganism."" She coaches other friends on how if they just worked out they'd be so much happier. She's ""HAPPY"" because she's skinny. I think she is doing a ton of damage...I think she is bulimic, as well. (She has a history of that behavior.) She's downing Tums constantly, complaining of heartburn.I finally talked to her about how I knew what she was doing, and while I loved her and wanted her to be happy,  I know this is  self-destruction and I can't be a part of it. She accused me of being toxic and unsupportive and, of course, jealous.Can two people with this struggle be friends? Are we really going to sit across from each other at a dinner and judge what you're eating v. what I'm eating? Am I going to have to look at you dying for me to tell you how skinny you are, when I think you look sick?

&lt;p&gt;But the question is: Can two people with eating disorders be friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have battled with disordered eating on and off throughout my life. I&amp;#39;m in my early 40s now. You&amp;#39;d think I would have this figured out by now.  About 4 years ago, I dropped down to a dangerously low weight. But, as so many of us have experienced, the &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re too skinny&amp;quot; was a welcome compliment. I was accomplishing something. I was proud of my xylophone ribs (and all the rest). I relished my routine of exercise, eating &amp;quot;clean,&amp;quot; wearing tiny sizes. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of shift in the last year and started to slow down on the exercising, eat more normally. It&amp;#39;s part of my pattern. At some point, the heart palpitations and aching bones just suck. I can&amp;#39;t keep up the rigor of that routine. But it&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t want to...which is the disordered part.My best friend of 20+ years decided she wanted to get a &amp;quot;Revenge bod&amp;quot; last summer. And I saw all the signs; obsessive exercise, tracking her weight on her bathroom mirror, eating little to nothing, getting angry when other people weren&amp;#39;t eating, getting angry when anyone questioned her behavior. Ostensibly, she says she is the &amp;quot;healthiest she&amp;#39;s ever been&amp;quot; -- yes, training for a marathon while also, you know, smoking. But worse, is that it is all she talks about; how much weight she&amp;#39;s lost, how much she&amp;#39;s exercising, her &amp;quot;veganism.&amp;quot; She coaches other friends on how if they just worked out they&amp;#39;d be so much happier. She&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;HAPPY&amp;quot; because she&amp;#39;s skinny. I think she is doing a ton of damage...I think she is bulimic, as well. (She has a history of that behavior.) She&amp;#39;s downing Tums constantly, complaining of heartburn.I finally talked to her about how I knew what she was doing, and while I loved her and wanted her to be happy,  I know this is  self-destruction and I can&amp;#39;t be a part of it. She accused me of being toxic and unsupportive and, of course, jealous.Can two people with this struggle be friends? Are we really going to sit across from each other at a dinner and judge what you&amp;#39;re eating v. what I&amp;#39;m eating? Am I going to have to look at you dying for me to tell you how skinny you are, when I think you look sick? Or better, tell you you&amp;#39;re too skinny and see that same gleam I used to get when people said that to me?Do we just put aside 20 years of friendship, being with each other through marriages, divorces, kids, parent&amp;#39;s dying, because this disorder is now always sitting at the table with both of us and I&amp;#39;m triggered as hell?&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Trigger warning: health issues, test results, mental health

So I've always had a bad relationship with food. For as long as I remember I've over eaten to the point of feeling sick and hidden food in my room so that nobody knew how much i was actually eating. My mother used to comment on it frequently but ofcourse that just made me hide it better. 

For a year or so I managed to really focus on exercising and eating healthily, almost entirely cutting out snacking. Then I had a child and snacking was more convenient.

For the last few years I have continued to gain weight. Ive had many people comment that I should actually be alot bigger than I am because of what I eat and how much I do eat. 

I have some preexisting health issues so i had noticed that my pain levels have increased and i live a pretty sedentary lifestyle which isnt great but I thought that was just down to my pain. Now I think that the bingeing, then gaining weight, is actually what has increased my pain and in turn made me struggle more with activity. I also noticed that im more breathless and getting sick more often but didnt think much of it. Que to most recently - ive been suffering with some stomach issues that we are struggling to find the cause of. I do have scans soon but recent blood tests revealed some deficiencies that are mainly caused by malnourishment. I am so exhausted all of the time and it is making me depressed. I cannot believe that my eating is causing all of this. And to make matters worse, im still bingeing! Probably more so! I feel sick every night at bed time because i spend hours consistently snacking when im not even hungry but i cant stop. Is there any hope for me?? Anyone got any tips?

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve always had a bad relationship with food. For as long as I remember I&amp;#39;ve over eaten to the point of feeling sick and hidden food in my room so that nobody knew how much i was actually eating. My mother used to comment on it frequently but ofcourse that just made me hide it better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a year or so I managed to really focus on exercising and eating healthily, almost entirely cutting out snacking. Then I had a child and snacking was more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"If family shaming or anything like that triggers you, then please don't read my post. Stay safe guys, and remember that you are more than your body.

I 15F, have been suffering from weight problems ever since I was 7 years old. My family would (and continues to til this day) comment on my weight. I was the elephant, the fatty of the family. Almost everyday my weight was brought up, and it had began to ruin my self image, and my relationship with food. At school, while no one ever said anything to me, I felt so ugly and out of place amongst my classmates and friends. I was envious that all the girls were skinny and pretty, but no one ever called me fat at school, so I was okay. I ate my food, played with my friends, read in the library, etc. 

In Year 5, I began stretching and all my family members began to praise my now thinner body, and for a while, I was the happiest, most carefree girl I had ever been, but soon it began to stress me out, and I began to binge whenever I was stressed. I gained weight, I stopped stretching, and my mental health suffered for it.

Whenever I'm stressed, I either stress eat, or I avoid eating. I began giving my friends my snacks, I shared my fruit with a friend, and I'd throw half my sandwich out. I told my mum that I ate everything at school and was too full to eat dinner. I began to hyperfixate on walking, and soon anything could set me off and I'd be bawling my eyes out. This week, I began to feel dizzy, and would fall over randomly. My face lost its colour, and it was hard to stay awake. One day, I fell down, and I had to fight the temptation to just pass out. My friends forced me to drink water, made me sit down, and watched me like a hawk.

Stay safe guys, and remember that you are more than your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I 15F, have been suffering from weight problems ever since I was 7 years old. My family would (and continues to til this day) comment on my weight. I was the elephant, the fatty of the family. Almost everyday my weight was brought up, and it had began to ruin my self image, and my relationship with food. At school, while no one ever said anything to me, I felt so ugly and out of place amongst my classmates and friends. I was envious that all the girls were skinny and pretty, but no one ever called me fat at school, so I was okay. I ate my food, played with my friends, read in the library, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Year 5, I began stretching and all my family members began to praise my now thinner body, and for a while, I was the happiest, most carefree girl I had ever been, but soon it began to stress me out, and I began to binge whenever I was stressed. I gained weight, I stopped stretching, and my mental health suffered for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I&amp;#39;m stressed, I either stress eat, or I avoid eating. I began giving my friends my snacks, I shared my fruit with a friend, and I&amp;#39;d throw half my sandwich out. I told my mum that I ate everything at school and was too full to eat dinner. I began to hyperfixate on walking, and soon anything could set me off and I&amp;#39;d be bawling my eyes out. This week, I began to feel dizzy, and would fall over randomly. My face lost its colour, and it was hard to stay awake. One day, I fell down, and I had to fight the temptation to just pass out. My friends forced me to drink water, made me sit down, and watched me like a hawk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it I guess. I feel like I might have an eating disorder but I&amp;#39;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

I was first diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa when I was twelve year old boy. Shortly thereafter I was enrolled in a specialized program for people with eating disorders on an outpatient basis. I came to the hospital every week and I'd get weighed and see a therapist and nutritionist. I hated the weighing part because If I was considered too skinny I was warned by the staff that I would have to be hospitalized. So, I started eating out of fear of being hospitalized, not because they had magically cured me. I still thought I was fat, and I still hated being over a certain weight.

The lowest point in my treatment was in my teens. I started losing a lot of weight because I was depressed and isolated at school. On top of that I was terrified of being hospitalized.  At one point I even came close to being admitted. When I turned eighteen I left the program because I was past the age limit, but my Anorexia was never cured. Even now I can’t associate that hospital with anything other than my nightmarish treatment.

,eating_disorders,"So Drake and Josh was a huge staple for me growing up for me. It was one of my favorite shows.

Until I read Josh Peck’s book, I really didn't know much about him, but I resonated a lot with the fact that he was overweight, was this awkward goofy kid to losing the weight and getting a girlfriend. You really see him change throughout the show. And I just felt like I resonated with that a lot.

And after reading his book I learned so much about addiction to food. I learned how my addiction to food may have affected my own life and why I even had it. So if you're struggling with addiction or if you've struggled with addiction, I hope this post resonates with you, and I hope you gain some value from this.

And I above all want you to read his book.

So growing up, he was just like me. He had a single mom and his dad left him. And I think that may have created some abandonment issues in him. And left him feeling like he wasn't enough. He implies that in the book. And I definitely feel the same way. That's just speculation.

But I can say in my own life that this insecurity definitely played into my addictions. Growing up, Josh was in love with food. And for me personally, I don't remember being in love or addicted to food, until specifically, there were traumas that happened, like my dad leaving or other things. The moment I got fat was the exact same time that these traumas happened.

I didn't really put the pieces in together until later on in life, which is kind of crazy. And Josh used food to cope with these emotions. He used it to feel good. And the central theme of their entire house was food. So much so that his mom, who also had an eating disorder, would constantly be on a diet, constantly fluctuating weight.

They would also binge together. They would go out to a restaurant and then they would get a bunch of snacks. And then they would go in their own rooms in their house and binge eat. And to Josh, it was fun. He was just a kid. He was just like, yeah, this is just the way life is. But obviously that's a very unhealthy relationship to food.

So at Josh's prime, he weighed 297 pounds. In his own words, he said he would've had to have been six foot 10 and from Samoa for this weight to sit correctly on his frame. Now I didn't get bullied a lot for my weight, but I was overweight. I was obese, but I wasn't that bad, but it was still something that I hated.

And I tried dieting and I couldn't lose it. It was so frustrating to try to lose weight, to feel like you don't have the willpower, to feel insecure about the way you looked and just not be healthy. And I wasn't playing sports. I. wasn't one of the “cool kids”. I felt very disconnected from my social circle or my group in school just like Josh.

He said it was way worse because in the nineties being overweight just meant open season. Like everyone's gonna make fun of you cuz there was no anti-bullying campaign. There's no body positivity back then. And what's worse is he weighed way more. It was a huge pain point for him, and I know a lot of overweight people can resonate with that.

He describes it as this downward cycle. you're fat. So you get made fun of, and you feel shitty about yourself, which makes you eat more to cope with your bad emotions, which makes you more fat and so on and so forth. And on the bright side of all this, all this eating and teasing gave Josh a really good sense of humor.

And what he meant by that is he would compensate for his insecurities with laughter with jokes, with being funny. He said that if he can make you laugh, then maybe you won't make fun of him. Matter of fact, if he can make you laugh, maybe he can control the entire conversation or the energy in the room.

Comedy to Josh was a superpower. There's a quote from the book that I really like. And it says, “The reason why people are funny is usually not funny at all.”

And I know a lot of people from books that I've read that are funny because of their insecurities, for example, will Smith.

He became such an entertainer because he wanted to ease the tension at his home because his father was very abusive towards his mom. He was getting bullied at school and in his own words, you can't be mad, hateful or racist when you're doubled over laughing.

Eventually Josh would have to face this aversion to himself and actually be himself instead of a character, but that's gonna come a lot later in his life.

In the meantime, him being funny, turned into not only a passion, but a career. He was doing standup comedy at eight years old. He started doing commercials, getting gigs for movies, small movies, big movies and as we all know, eventually a whole TV show with his name on it. He started getting paid and his mom and his financial burdens were being alleviated through him.

He started paying the bills. He moved them all out to Cali, all from this passion of comedy that was created from this insecurity to feel good enough to get validation. And I think it's so incredible that out of all of this pain came something really good. If you ever get bored, just watch some highlights of that show and you'll see that it was really a funny show and there's a reason why it's still playing today.

They ended up filming 60 episodes and two movies. And over the course of the whole series, he loses 127 pounds. The fact that the entire weight loss journey was documented on TV made a lot of people, judge him for losing weight. Isn't that crazy? Like, can you imagine,

“Sir, can you, uh, not change your character, please just stay unhealthy and be considerate because we're all wanting you to stay the same.”

People were objecting to him being healthy and improving his life.

But, in his own words, because he lost all of the weight, he started doing drugs.

Losing the weight didn't change his mind. It only changed his body.

This makes a lot of sense to me because when I eventually lost my weight, that's kind of, when I started doing drugs and fell into other addictions

The addiction to escaping myself, didn't go away.

Merely the food part was under control, but even then I was still fluctuating weight a lot. I had my weight under control. But there was a lot of binging and dieting and binging and dieting. That was just simply the same broken brain in a new body. It was just never stable. I even remember a lot of my friends saying, Danny, you lose weight and gain weight very, very frequently and very fast.

For Josh, He was 18 years old. He had lost all of his weight. He was in control of his eating. He had quote unquote made it. He had his own hit TV show, making money, things were looking good. The future was bright, but his brain hasn't caught up to his success yet. He had a broken brain in a new body, and this is when he started using drugs.

So he started using drugs for the same reason why he overate to escape that feeling of being him.

And I'm starting to realize that any addiction that I might have is just because I'm not confronting me.

And I'm avoiding myself through external things through external pleasures.

He did cocaine for the first time when he was 18 with his girlfriend, he just did it to feel normal and fit in.

And when he first did it, he said he didn't feel anything. He said he guessed it didn't work. He went to a party. He was extremely social. If anything, he just felt like himself. And that's the crazy part. The drugs made him feel like more of himself for the first time. He didn't feel the pain of just existing. He mistook being high for being alive.

Imagine carrying an invisible backpack full of pain and trauma, your entire life. And then drugs are these magical potions that can make the weight of that backpack instantly feel lighter. He had been searching for a medicine like this, his entire life.

**The lie we tell ourselves is as I am, I am not enough.**

And that night for him doing drugs for the first time, he felt like enough. And the change was subtle. It took a few nights just like that before he noticed a change, he felt like at first he was in control. And I totally understand that because in my journey I've done drugs and I felt like they were helping me.

I convinced myself, they were making me more social, more confident, a better person. When in reality, they were doing the opposite. They were just crutches for not feeling like I was. In his head, he was getting relief. And for the next four years, he was chasing that feeling of being okay. Of being enough.

And he ruined a lot of opportunity in the process and to backtrack a little, how did Josh lose the weight?…

What was the secret?…

There was no secret. Diet and exercise, baby. He just did it. And that was the same experience for me.

One day I came home from a very long vacation and I'd gotten the most fat I had ever been. I was straight up obese at that point and everyone was making fun of me.

I grew up from an Asian household and they're very vocal about your weight. And I remember there's was a family friend that I had a huge crush on and she grabbed my cheeks and she said, “Danny, oh my God, you got so chubby.” And in that moment, my heart shattered. That same day, it wasn't even a decision or a goal.

I just started running. I just stopped eating. I lost the weight.

Here's my theory. **When the pain of staying the same hurts more than the pain of change and discipline and willpower and transformation, you will change.** At that moment of just straight pain, Both Josh and I just started working out and doing the work day in and day out.

But here's the problem. One addiction can easily replace the other. What's more important than fixing your diet or putting a bandaid on your problems is fixing your mind and figuring out the place that the addiction is coming from.

If you don't fix the insecurity and the feeling in your, in your mind, you won't be happy.

You feel like you won't deserve to be.

No amount of validation or external things will help you. And this is when Josh realized. The drug addiction was out of control.

For a six week period, he worked on this movie called the Wackness. It was a role of him being a drug dealer and trading drugs for therapy to this crazy therapist.

And the role was so perfect for Josh and he was working with some of his favorite co-stars that he actually quit drugs for six weeks just to shoot this movie.

And during the showing, they won at the film festival, they won a bunch of awards. He got a standing ovation. Everyone wanted to interview him.

And all he wanted to do was go home because he hated that he felt like he didn't deserve any of it. He didn't feel like he deserved to win. And it was after this that he realized that he needed help and he started going to AA.

He started going to meetings. He started getting accountability. And he got off drugs sober, and he found a community that supported him.

But more importantly, they understood him his pain and his trauma. And while he was in no way fixed from just being sober, he says that it was the start of his journey of self actualizing and accepting himself.

Reading this book has made me realize that for addiction, it's important to look at the root of the addiction, the cause.

And it's forced me to look inward and ask myself. Why? Why am I craving that thing? What emotion am I trying to cover up? What am I running away from? And for me, I'm constantly running away from my emotions and what I'm feeling and as time goes on, I'm getting much better at identifying when I'm in a rut.

And when I'm not feeling good mentally, I’d rather just sit with that emotion and not let it control me to make an impulsive decision that I don't even wanna make.

One thing that I’ve done that helps a lot is meditation

I’ve done a 2 hour a day meditation challenge, and it opened my eyes a lot. I have a video abt it on my YT.

And basically that's me being proactive with myself saying every day, I'm actually gonna set aside time, focus on myself and my emotions and make sure I'm good before I go out and grind and do things.

And maybe I sit with myself and realize I need to stop. I need to slow down. I need to take a break.

So guys, I hope you gain some great value from this. And I so enjoyed reading this book and shooting this. So thank you so much for watching guys, peace.",t2_o7ek25hq,False,,0,False,How Josh Peck OVERCAME his Addiction To Food + Drugs,[],r/eating_disorders,False,0,,0,,False,t3_w92y1h,False,dark,0.86,,public,15,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1658890030.0,text,0,,,text,self.eating_disorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Drake and Josh was a huge staple for me growing up for me.

&lt;p&gt;They would also binge together. They would go out to a restaurant and then they would get a bunch of snacks. And then they would go in their own rooms in their house and binge eat. And to Josh, it was fun. He was just a kid. He was just like, yeah, this is just the way life is. But obviously that&amp;#39;s a very unhealthy relationship to food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at Josh&amp;#39;s prime, he weighed 297 pounds. In his own words, he said he would&amp;#39;ve had to have been six foot 10 and from Samoa for this weight to sit correctly on his frame. Now I didn&amp;#39;t get bullied a lot for my weight, but I was overweight. I was obese, but I wasn&amp;#39;t that bad, but it was still something that I hated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I tried dieting and I couldn&amp;#39;t lose it. It was so frustrating to try to lose weight, to feel like you don&amp;#39;t have the willpower, to feel insecure about the way you looked and just not be healthy. And I wasn&amp;#39;t playing sports. I. wasn&amp;#39;t one of the “cool kids”. I felt very disconnected from my social circle or my group in school just like Josh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said it was way worse because in the nineties being overweight just meant open season. Like everyone&amp;#39;s gonna make fun of you cuz there was no anti-bullying campaign. There&amp;#39;s no body positivity back then. And what&amp;#39;s worse is he weighed way more. It was a huge pain point for him, and I know a lot of overweight people can resonate with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He describes it as this downward cycle. you&amp;#39;re fat. So you get made fun of, and you feel shitty about yourself, which makes you eat more to cope with your bad emotions, which makes you more fat and so on and so forth. And on the bright side of all this, all this eating and teasing gave Josh a really good sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what he meant by that is he would compensate for his insecurities with laughter with jokes, with being funny. He said that if he can make you laugh, then maybe you won&amp;#39;t make fun of him. Matter of fact, if he can make you laugh, maybe he can control the entire conversation or the energy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comedy to Josh was a superpower. There&amp;#39;s a quote from the book that I really like. And it says, “The reason why people are funny is usually not funny at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know a lot of people from books that I&amp;#39;ve read that are funny because of their insecurities, for example, will Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He became such an entertainer because he wanted to ease the tension at his home because his father was very abusive towards his mom. He was getting bullied at school and in his own words, you can&amp;#39;t be mad, hateful or racist when you&amp;#39;re doubled over laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Josh would have to face this aversion to himself and actually be himself instead of a character, but that&amp;#39;s gonna come a lot later in his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, him being funny, turned into not only a passion, but a career. He was doing standup comedy at eight years old. He started doing commercials, getting gigs for movies, small movies, big movies and as we all know, eventually a whole TV show with his name on it. He started getting paid and his mom and his financial burdens were being alleviated through him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started paying the bills. He moved them all out to Cali, all from this passion of comedy that was created from this insecurity to feel good enough to get validation. And I think it&amp;#39;s so incredible that out of all of this pain came something really good. If you ever get bored, just watch some highlights of that show and you&amp;#39;ll see that it was really a funny show and there&amp;#39;s a reason why it&amp;#39;s still playing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ended up filming 60 episodes and two movies. And over the course of the whole series, he loses 127 pounds. The fact that the entire weight loss journey was documented on TV made a lot of people, judge him for losing weight. Isn&amp;#39;t that crazy? Like, can you imagine,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sir, can you, uh, not change your character, please just stay unhealthy and be considerate because we&amp;#39;re all wanting you to stay the same.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were objecting to him being healthy and improving his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in his own words, because he lost all of the weight, he started doing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing the weight didn&amp;#39;t change his mind. It only changed his body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes a lot of sense to me because when I eventually lost my weight, that&amp;#39;s kind of, when I started doing drugs and fell into other addictions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addiction to escaping myself, didn&amp;#39;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely the food part was under control, but even then I was still fluctuating weight a lot. I had my weight under control. But there was a lot of binging and dieting and binging and dieting. That was just simply the same broken brain in a new body. It was just never stable. I even remember a lot of my friends saying, Danny, you lose weight and gain weight very, very frequently and very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Josh, He was 18 years old. He had lost all of his weight. He was in control of his eating. He had quote unquote made it. He had his own hit TV show, making money, things were looking good. The future was bright, but his brain hasn&amp;#39;t caught up to his success yet. He had a broken brain in a new body, and this is when he started using drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he started using drugs for the same reason why he overate to escape that feeling of being him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m starting to realize that any addiction that I might have is just because I&amp;#39;m not confronting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m avoiding myself through external things through external pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did cocaine for the first time when he was 18 with his girlfriend, he just did it to feel normal and fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when he first did it, he said he didn&amp;#39;t feel anything. He said he guessed it didn&amp;#39;t work. He went to a party. He was extremely social. If anything, he just felt like himself. And that&amp;#39;s the crazy part. The drugs made him feel like more of himself for the first time. He didn&amp;#39;t feel the pain of just existing. He mistook being high for being alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine carrying an invisible backpack full of pain and trauma, your entire life. And then drugs are these magical potions that can make the weight of that backpack instantly feel lighter. He had been searching for a medicine like this, his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lie we tell ourselves is as I am, I am not enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that night for him doing drugs for the first time, he felt like enough. And the change was subtle. It took a few nights just like that before he noticed a change, he felt like at first he was in control. And I totally understand that because in my journey I&amp;#39;ve done drugs and I felt like they were helping me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I convinced myself, they were making me more social, more confident, a better person. When in reality, they were doing the opposite. They were just crutches for not feeling like I was. In his head, he was getting relief. And for the next four years, he was chasing that feeling of being okay. Of being enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he ruined a lot of opportunity in the process and to backtrack a little, how did Josh lose the weight?…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the secret?…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no secret. Diet and exercise, baby. He just did it. And that was the same experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I came home from a very long vacation and I&amp;#39;d gotten the most fat I had ever been. I was straight up obese at that point and everyone was making fun of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up from an Asian household and they&amp;#39;re very vocal about your weight. And I remember there&amp;#39;s was a family friend that I had a huge crush on and she grabbed my cheeks and she said, “Danny, oh my God, you got so chubby.” And in that moment, my heart shattered. That same day, it wasn&amp;#39;t even a decision or a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just started running. I just stopped eating. I lost the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my theory. &lt;strong&gt;When the pain of staying the same hurts more than the pain of change and discipline and willpower and transformation, you will change.&lt;/strong&gt; At that moment of just straight pain, Both Josh and I just started working out and doing the work day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the problem. One addiction can easily replace the other. What&amp;#39;s more important than fixing your diet or putting a bandaid on your problems is fixing your mind and figuring out the place that the addiction is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t fix the insecurity and the feeling in your, in your mind, you won&amp;#39;t be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You feel like you won&amp;#39;t deserve to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No amount of validation or external things will help you. And this is when Josh realized. The drug addiction was out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a six week period, he worked on this movie called the Wackness. It was a role of him being a drug dealer and trading drugs for therapy to this crazy therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the role was so perfect for Josh and he was working with some of his favorite co-stars that he actually quit drugs for six weeks just to shoot this movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And during the showing, they won at the film festival, they won a bunch of awards. He got a standing ovation. Everyone wanted to interview him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all he wanted to do was go home because he hated that he felt like he didn&amp;#39;t deserve any of it. He didn&amp;#39;t feel like he deserved to win. And it was after this that he realized that he needed help and he started going to AA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started going to meetings. He started getting accountability. And he got off drugs sober, and he found a community that supported him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, they understood him his pain and his trauma. And while he was in no way fixed from just being sober, he says that it was the start of his journey of self actualizing and accepting himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading this book has made me realize that for addiction, it&amp;#39;s important to look at the root of the addiction, the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s forced me to look inward and ask myself. Why? Why am I craving that thing? What emotion am I trying to cover up? What am I running away from? And for me, I&amp;#39;m constantly running away from my emotions and what I&amp;#39;m feeling and as time goes on, I&amp;#39;m getting much better at identifying when I&amp;#39;m in a rut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I&amp;#39;m not feeling good mentally, I’d rather just sit with that emotion and not let it control me to make an impulsive decision that I don&amp;#39;t even wanna make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve done that helps a lot is meditation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a 2 hour a day meditation challenge, and it opened my eyes a lot. I have a video abt it on my YT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And basically that&amp;#39;s me being proactive with myself saying every day, I&amp;#39;m actually gonna set aside time, focus on myself and my emotions and make sure I&amp;#39;m good before I go out and grind and do things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe I sit with myself and realize I need to stop. I need to slow down. I need to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guys, I hope you gain some great value from this. And I so enjoyed reading this book and shooting this. So thank you so much for watching guys, peace.&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"I know I shouldn’t be but I am. I know I will be accused of glamorising/romanticising anorexia and I feel really bad about that. I can’t help but be jealous and here is why….

I am 5’8 and 145lbs. Which is not obese but I feel fat. I feel so fat. When I wear jeans, some ‘flab’ hangs out from the top of them around my ‘waist’. My thighs are huge. I have so much fat around my tummy that I can squish it and hold it with my hands. It is so disgusting. My arms and face are also fat. I am a surfer and surfer girls are supposed to be thin and athletic. In photos of me surfing my thighs look huge and my face looks fat. I struggle with Binge Eating Disorder. I can’t stop eating. Either because I am STILL hungry (My stomach is honestly like a bottomless pit, I hate it) or I will just be eating out of compulsion. 

I have wanted to be skinny for about a year and a half now. For the past 7 months I have been actively trying to eat less and lose weight. I am educated and know how weightloss is achieved. I just can’t do it. If I was consistent with a calorie deficit I could be skinny by now. But I can barely manage to be in a calorie deficit for one day because of my BED. I have lost NOTHING! It makes me feel like such a failure. 

Meanwhile, my twin is deep into anorexia. We are identical so she looks like a skinny version of me. I am upset that I’m the one that had to get the eating disorder that makes you a fat whale and she got the restrictive one where you end up losing weight and being skinny. This is also maybe a silly comparison but at uni she will save lots of money because she won’t spend any money on food and meanwhile I will spend loads on food. My twin literally doesn’t eat. And she never complains of being hungry and never (as far as I know) feels unwell, sick, light headed etc. When I try and restrict my food intake I get light headed within the same day, maybe because I’m not used to it, and then I compulsively eat and then feel upset with myself. 

My twin eats fruit only. Maybe a bowl of soup every other day or something. Maybe some crackers or a packet of crisps. That’s it. She has not had more than one meal in a day for ages. She has been consistently doing this for about 6 months now and has drastically lost weight. This makes me feel even more fat! And the fact she eats nothing makes me feel super greedy in comparison (I am greedy and disgusting anyway) when I am always walking around the hide with food and I never seen her open the fridge or eat. 

She used to be double my size and now she is smaller than me and it makes me upset when she talks about clothes she has bought and casually says things to me like “By the way, if you decided to get this dress too, you would need it in a size bigger than this one.” When she walks around the house I find myself looking and her body and being jealous and sad.

DAY. like i don&amp;#39;t ever feel hungry anymore bc i just eat so much. i get bored? i eat. i&amp;#39;m watching tv? i eat. not even hungry in the slightest? i eat. not doing anything with my hands? i eat. maybe some of it is bc of my adhd and always needing to be doing something but idk. it&amp;#39;s not small amounts either like i&amp;#39;ll eat a whole ass bag of chips in ONE sitting. even the family size. or i&amp;#39;ll eat a pound of rice in one sitting.(did that earlier yesterday) i just now realized that i am doing that and maybe it&amp;#39;s like a replacement to sh??? i haven&amp;#39;t cut in several months. at least 6. idk what to do to fix this. my solution is to just become anorexic again but the &amp;quot;good and healthy kind&amp;quot; where you work out a lot but that&amp;#39;s not a solution and i hate working out. plus there is no such thing as a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; ed. it&amp;#39;s all bad. i also realized that binge eating and having an addiction to eating triggers the same area in the brain as a drug addiction. always told myself i never get addicted to anything. kinda funny. got addicted to sh AND food. this is bad. ig i just need advice on how to fix this bc ik once i get out of the habit of eating every hour and eating a shit ton of food at once i won&amp;#39;t do it anymore but like i don&amp;#39;t wanna develop another addiction in the process like chewing gum constantly. that&amp;#39;s been an idea i&amp;#39;ve had but i feel like it&amp;#39;d end the same way as this has. idk. i just do everything wrong and it cause more issues. as is evident. sry if this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense i was kinda just typing whatever came to my mind. also this was copied from a post i made in the sh subreddits bc it kinda had to do with my sh i just deleted some things and re worded some other stuff but idk. no one there could really help me. now today i only ate some nuggets when i just woke up which was almost 12 hours ago and i refuse to eat anything bc i don&amp;#39;t believe that i&amp;#39;m actually hungry. i feel like it&amp;#39;s my brain trying to trick me into eating when i don&amp;#39;t need to ya know. bc it&amp;#39;s so used to eating all the fucking time now. i feel like i&amp;#39;ll be stuck in this cycle forever. going between anorexia and binge eating. i hate this...... also sorry if i used the wrong flair i&amp;#39;m not very smart and don&amp;#39;t know any ed terms or acronyms yet. kinda been in denial ab having an ed for years :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: k then. over 500 people saw this and no one decided to help me lmfao. i get ignored in every subreddit man. maybe i&amp;#39;m just making up the who ed thing. clearly this isn&amp;#39;t an issue if everyone ignores it. i&amp;#39;m upset that i wasted so much time typing this 💀&lt;/p&gt;

I rarely eat. I never have breakfast, rarely eat anything for lunch. I eat dinner most nights because my boyfriend cooks it for me but when he is away I will just snack on some crisps and call it a day. Quite often I leave up to half of my dinner.

I don’t really exercise much, I have a desk job and at most I have to walk up and down a few flights of stairs a day. I think this helps me to not lose what weight I do have. But things like showers can make me feel faint unless I eat something sugary before having one.

I don’t have the symptoms of a typical eating disorder.

,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone.

For years now I’ve (26f) had difficulty eating things I’m not in the mood for. I frequently skip dinners my husband makes because it’s not what I want at the moment and the thought of eating it is repulsive. They’re not even meals that are different from what I normally eat. I also have problems with food I take to work. For example, yesterday I made a turkey sandwich for lunch. I took one bite, realized I was not in the mood for it and had such a difficult time getting the food down. I had to force myself to chew and swallow it and it was so unsatisfying. In my head I felt like I was eating gray sludge. I couldn’t even finish it because of how much I wasn’t in the mood and I’d rather just not eat than put it in my mouth again. Now last week, I ate like 4 turkey sandwiches because I was craving them and didn’t have any problems. I also have problems with textures and very flavorful meals but that’s typically an issue with unfamiliar foods.

Does anyone else experience this? I feel bad for wasting food that’s made but it’s just unbearable to eat things that I’m not craving right at that moment. I had a referral sent to the psychiatrist but haven’t had anyone reach out. Last time I spoke to them 3 weeks ago, they said the next opening was in September. I don’t even know if this is an ED if I’m just picky and if they can even help with it. I am overweight so I’m definitely getting enough food. I’m just frustrated with it all.

,eating_disorders,"Hi there. So I'm (28F) just looking for some advice I guess regarding my husband (30M) and his body image issues. He suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that I am sometimes concerned and honestly I'm reaching a point where I am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. I try to be understanding and reassuring to him. He has a very abusive father who he is permanently NC with now for over a year. His father spent basically his whole childhood berating DH for his weight. He was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. They filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. My heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight (just straight up bullying) and the things he would do to shame him for it.

When he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can't remember exactly what it was. His weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he's always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. When we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto.

He's gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. I'm a little chubby myself so I don't care at all. I'm bigger than him, I feel. He, however, is distraught about it all the time. He's tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it's honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together.

I've urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that's not diet-friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. He stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. It worries me a lot. If I wasn't with him almost all the time, I would really worry about him skipping meals.

My issue now is that I cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. It's starting to negatively affect my own self image and I'm starting to obsess too. I can't handle him saying ""I'm so fat"" and telling him ""You look fine, I like how you look"" twenty times a day. Sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so I don't know what to say. He sees a therapist for other things, and I have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won't do it. He thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won't care about how he looks and he'll get fat, and I don't know how to explain to him that that's not how that works.

I'm really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but I don't know how to say this to him. I'm so frustrated and sometimes I feel he can tell how tired I am of the conversation. I don't want to hurt him or make him feel like I'm not there for him, but there's nothing more I feel I can do and it's really starting to get into my head and I'm feeling bad about my own body.

,eating_disorders,"(TW. Mental issues, ED, selfhate) 

Within the past 2 or 3 years I've been finding myself eating less and less, going some days without eating.....because of my social anxiety. I live with my mum and her bf, her bf is the main source of my social anxiety because he'd call me name behind my back and during their fights. He makes me afraid of even going downstairs because I'm afraid he'll call me fat. So with that I started starving myself and barely eating. From May to Now I've went from 240lbs to now 226lbs. Hell even lately I've been more concerned about my weight, isolating myself and barely eating because of it. I'm afraid of eating  in front of people and often just eat food in my room. These past years I've developed a goal weight for myself which was 90lbs even though i'm 5'8 and have posted on reddits and people have suggested I might have an eating disorder. I've always worn loose clothing and hated my body but lately just seems like it's getting worse. Some days I'd rather not eat because of how much of a pig I am, afraid to meet people because of how fat I am.

,eating_disorders,"Hey guys. I'm looking for some help. Last October, after becoming overweight over lockdown due to mental health issues, I began trying to lose some weight. Most of my motivation to lose the weight came from persistent comments from my family and such; I was happy with my body. It wasn't really something I thought about. I don't know thought. One day I just snapped. I ended up losing a good amount, and once I hit my goal weight (pre-lockdown weight), I wasn't happy; I had to keep going. I've stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven't really gone past a safe deficit. I've only restricted 500-1000 calories each day, mostly just a 500 cal deficit. However, I know my mindset isn't a healthy one. I'm obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. My weight-loss hasn't been drastic, and im still in a 'healthy' BMI now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. This whole makes me feel awful because since like last october I've only lost about 20 pounds. I started at like 135 lbs at 5'1"" and am now about 115. It's taken me literally so long to get this far but its felt gut wrenchingly long. I feel like I shouldve done better

Anyways in the past few months, I've started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. Today was my second visit, (first was three months ago) and my doctor expressed concern with it, (even though it was only like 6lbs in 3 months), saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she'll consider referring me to a nutritionist. This means that my weight loss is no longer something I can hide behind, which terrifies me. I'm not happy with my body yet, but I have no other choice but to try and recover. I don't want to but there's not really another choice. I'm worried if I'm referred to a nutritionist I'll be forced to stop being vegan (my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons), or something so I would really love to avoid having to go to one. I'm so worried and I don't want to stop losing but I need to recover.

Do any of you guys have advice for self recovery and getting out of the ""not sick enough"" mindset and pursuing recovery? How do I get my ""goal weight"" out of my mind and try to get over this

I can't stand the idea that I won't be really able to lose any more weight, and If I do it'll have to be at a much slower rate. I can't stand the idea that I won't get to my goal weight. It's only 10lbs away, but it feels like the end of the world that I won't be able to make it there,

I don't really know what this post is anymore. kind of a rant of desperation kind of a ""how do i deal with this"" type post. My eating habits have been like this for almost a whole year I can't fathom the idea of going back to maintenance cals. Please help me. I'm so worried. I would do anything not to gain a single pound back. Even if I can't hit 105 I cant imagine not being able to lose anymore. My head is spinning and this is driving me nuts.

,eating_disorders,"Starting off, for a while I have felt like something is off with my relationship with food. I know something is wrong, I just don't have a label to describe it. I want some sort of label so I can at least have a word to
describe what I am going through. Currently, I am unable to get a professional dx, yet I'm starting to see a counselor for the first time September. I'm not sure if I'll feel comfortable telling them right away, or at all. And if I do, I would like some word or at least an idea of what to say when I bring it up. That is why I'm turning to asking Reddit. 

 When I was a young kid, I did not like eating at all. My parents were always having to force feed me themselves, because I would never willingly eat a full plate on my own. I would do thing such as hide my food in a napkin, bribe my siblings to eat it for me, hold it in my cheeks and spit it out in the toilet, or hide my food in the trash. And if I did eat anything, it would take me at least an hour to finish a plate. My doctor was concerned about me being underweight too. 

Ive felt negative about eating for a while now too. The process of digestion grosses me out, and the idea of chewing, swallowing, and having your food come out of you has always made me uncomfortable. But I would eat food if I had to, because in my culture, where I'm from, refusing food when it's offered to you can be seen as offensive and rude. 

Then, during January I went through a depressive episode. I stayed in my bed, and didn't shower, change
my clothes, or even my bedsheets after my dog had peed on them. It was gross. During that time, I barely ate at all. The most I would eat per day is 5 spoons of food if I could handle it. I lost a lot of weight, weighing between 70-80 pounds at the time. 

Then, when I got out of that state, I started eating a lot. I'd eat a lot of food in one sitting til where I felt uncomfortable. I felt gross the whole time while eating, but I wasn't able to stop myself. Then, I'd try to make up for it by not eating at all for at least 24 hrs, or by making myself throw up. But my gag reflex is practically nonexistent, and it took a lot to make myself throw up
to where my throat would be really sore after so l don't like doing it that much. It feels like an endless cycle of me eating, then my stomach hurts and I feel bad
because I ate, and then I don't eat, and then my stomach hurts because I didn't eat and I can't stop myself from eating again.

It took a while but I ended up accepting myself and mentally got much better than when I was struggling. Weirdly it was easier to accept myself this way. I truly became a happier person.
The problem is that now I'm very clearly overweight and people notice it. Their comments hurt so much that these last few weeks I began obsessing the same way I used to back then. People say ""OP you were so much prettier when you were skinny stop gaining weight!"" That just hurts so much. And it gets to me everytime! I gain some confidence back and it's gone the moment they say something like this. These last weeks I had this temptations to start again but deep down I know I can't anymore because my body has had enough torture. I also know that I don't want to stay like this forever but part of me feels like I'll never be normal again.
I can try dieting but it will either trigger the ED or I just won't follow though because I'll feel ""trapped"" again. Maybe there's a possibility that someone else went trough this? Is there hope? Is this just a phase?

I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared. 

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

,eating_disorders,"Someone I hold very close to my heart has been dealing with their weight for about 2 years I think? It started really badly with them trying to reduce their weight by going about their day not eating anything, not even water.

I'm worried sick and I don't know how to try and get them to a healthier lifestyle. I love them soso much. They're still trying to lower their weight and get super anxious with even 3 kg increase in their weight and go to extreme lengths to reduce the weight. I've tried numerous times and I thought they were getting better but recently, I have realised that since they think what they're doing is working and don't show any side effects rn, it's fine to keep doing it.

I've tried suggesting to eat 3 meals a day; just tiny things 3 times a day.

,eating_disorders,"First of all i've been struggling with eating disorders since i was in middle school. I have never been diagnosed because I avoid the subject with doctors/therapists and it scares me to tell someone. 

Two years ago (when I was 14) I reached my lowest weight but managed to recover partially over time with the help of my antidepressants. I relapsed recently, in april 2022. 

My triggers are mostly things like comments about my weight or appearance, or comments about my eating habits.   However, I also get triggered a lot by other people's eating habits. I have a great sense of observation and I get scared and jealous when people eat less than me. I know it is immature and petty but I am trying to overcome it, which leads me to the important point of this post: 

I have noticed that my friend has developped and eating disorded a short time after my relapse. (I wont get into details but i am certain she has one, more precisely anorexia) 
I am usually always there for my friends and I always want to help them when I notice something is wrong. Usually I would have asked her what is going on in case she wants to talk about it, but i can't bring myself to do it because if she admits to having an ed it will:

1) make me wanna help her but how can i help if i have the same problem? 
2) If i do help her I would have to recover too and i dont want to
3) if she admits to having an ed i know i will see it as competiton and mine will get worse
4) she may be triggered by me bringing up the subject

So im in this mindset where if I do nothing I'm a bad selfish friend, and if i do someting i'm hypocritical (not following my own advices) and also a bad friend (by maybe triggering  her). Idk what to do


I feel even more selfish because I want her to recover not only for her wellbeing, but also because if she eats normally then I can stop comparing myself to her.

,eating_disorders,"Hi all,

I just joined this group because last year I had some disordered eating crop up out of the blue after 15 years of dormancy.

I used to restrict when I was like 15/16 and then I started abusing substances which kinda killed two birds with one stone. Bc drugs made me skinny and less hungry and helped me to numb my feelings. I stopped obsessing about food and body weight eventually 

I’ve now been sober 9 years and no major food/body image issues. Last summer I had some major life changes and life kinda spiraled out of control. I lost a bunch of weight bc of anxiety n depression and then I became obsessed this last year with keeping the weight off.

I’ve put on some weight and I’m trying to be happy about it because I know I’m healthier now, but I’m constantly battling the desire to restrict with the healthy part telling me to give my body nutrition. the really annoying part is the near constant dialogue about my looks my aging and if I look fat and what’s the right weight to be.

,eating_disorders,"I'm not sure if I need to, but perhaps this will trigger some folks as it is quite the lengthy bummer, and I wouldn't want that, therefore I have added a trigger warning, just to be safe.  

I have nobody.  Not a single soul who cares enough about me to check in.  My mother is very supportive, but her support changed just yesterday, and I am not able to look at her the way I did prior to the conversation that made me realize that this was all too much for her.  I love her more than anything and I will no longer drag her through this with me.  Unfortunately, that means, apart from my wonderful weekly psychiatrist sessions, I have to go at this alone now.  Because I can't text or call him every time I need to vent or rage or cry.  I don't expect that.  But I did expect some kind of care from all the family members who knew and still know that I struggle.  Nothing big, just a ""how are you?"" once in a blue moon.  That is honestly where I have capped my expectations. But every single one of them has disappeared.  My best friend checked out.  God has left me.  Nobody even knows I exist.  I don't know how to be lonely in this ED.  Why on earth would I leave behind the one thing that has seen me through my worst days now?  I have no motivation to change and no reason to keep fighting.  My logical brain says ""don't listen to the ED, it lies, people do give a sht"".  But evidence doesn't tell lies, and the evidence is in the absence of quite literally every person who ever gave a damn about me.

&lt;p&gt;I have nobody.  Not a single soul who cares enough about me to check in.  My mother is very supportive, but her support changed just yesterday, and I am not able to look at her the way I did prior to the conversation that made me realize that this was all too much for her.  I love her more than anything and I will no longer drag her through this with me.  Unfortunately, that means, apart from my wonderful weekly psychiatrist sessions, I have to go at this alone now.  Because I can&amp;#39;t text or call him every time I need to vent or rage or cry.  I don&amp;#39;t expect that.  But I did expect some kind of care from all the family members who knew and still know that I struggle.  Nothing big, just a &amp;quot;how are you?&amp;quot; once in a blue moon.  That is honestly where I have capped my expectations. But every single one of them has disappeared.  My best friend checked out.  God has left me.  Nobody even knows I exist.  I don&amp;#39;t know how to be lonely in this ED.  Why on earth would I leave behind the one thing that has seen me through my worst days now?  I have no motivation to change and no reason to keep fighting.  My logical brain says &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t listen to the ED, it lies, people do give a sht&amp;quot;.  But evidence doesn&amp;#39;t tell lies, and the evidence is in the absence of quite literally every person who ever gave a damn about me.

,eating_disorders,"(mention of an obssessive eating disorder) 

This seems like more of a rant, but its ED relivant, so I decided to come here. When i first met my friend, I had an obssessive eating disorder. I just basically ate so much and i honestly couldnt stop. This became part of my personality to her 

Back at the start, I used to eat double the regular amount for a kid my age. I would eat an entire pizza and still be hungry for another meal at like 9 (not an exact age tho). Eating entire gallon-tubs of icecream in less than an hour and still needing more food. (This wasnt healthy for me because i wasnt getting enough excersize to work off the level of calories i would eat) . 

Its been 6+ years and she still thinks i eat alot. Its not a trigger for me, but its really awkward in conversation because she always says something alon the lines of ""you LOVE your food"" or ""knowing you, we'd need another pizza"" 

Like its obvious that i dont do that anymore. Im not the same raiding-your-fridge kindof kid that i was a long time ago. Im not begging for food or stuff like that. In fact, its been so long since ive had the ED that ive been able to heal myself and ive begun to loose weight (in a healthy way, through sports and excersize lol) 

Idk, she just does that alot. Again, its not a trigger and its not a big deal to me- but its getting annoying because im not the same person and i feel like its starting to humiliate me a little. She'll say stuff like that in front of her family or our friends and ofc everyone laughs because its funny but its not to me anymore.

,eating_disorders,"Hello I am 24(M) and looking for some advice because I really don’t know where else to go. I recently went through an eating disorder and lost 100lbs  in 8 months by under-eating (1200 calories) and exercising excessively 6 days a week for 2+ hours. The excersizes started off as only cardio but then I transitioned to mainly weight lifting.

I eventually had a mental breakdown and went to the doctor because I was starting to have anxiety panic attacks, depression and extreme muscle pain. I then did blood work and I was severely deficient in testosterone (98!) and vitamin D. I was referred to a urologist and endocrinologist whom came to the conclusion that I had put my body into starvation mode and my reproductive system shut down to preserve energy for my vital organs. That caused me to stop producing testosterone. Which low T can cause depression, anxiety and loss of muscle mass.

I have not worked out or dieted since my breakdown which was three months ago. I have gotten treated for the testosterone deficiency with testosterone pellets and am now over the normal range and am also now in the normal range for vitamin D. I am on antidepressants and my mental health has improved a tad bit and I have intentionally gained about fifteen pounds. 

The problem is that after resolving many of my issues I am still having severe muscle pain (deep burning sensation) in my triceps, buttocks, calves and sides of my neck (which coincidentally are the muscle groups I trained).I have tried several nsaids, extra strength Tylenol, and my PCP even started me on Cymbalta because she said that this could help the depression and can treat fibromyalgia which causes muscle aches. None of these medications have provided me with relief. And I don’t think I developed fibromyalgia over night because  before the weight loss I rarely had muscle pain.

I have had inflammation, Ck and magnesium labs that have all came back in range so I don’t think it’s anything autoimmune related. I thought once I got my testosterone back in range or gained weight that the pain would ease up. I left my job after the mental breakdown and have been resting for weeks and that hasn’t even helped the pain.

It seems like it worsens/flares up when I am stressed out or get upset. The pain gets so bad that I can’t even think straight sometimes and the only thing that semi helps is when I massage the areas.

i don't think i have an eating disorder but i dont think i have the best relationship with food. like i definitely have periods where im calorie counting, i occasionally make myself not eat a lot for meals and i try not to snack much (obv i fail) but it's just. so tiring sometimes. but usually i eat enough.

and sometimes i just hate myself so much over it. just like *stop eating. stop.* i went to a friends house and we made smores and i had four and a half. and my friend something like ""yeah usually people only eat one"". and i can't stop thinking about it. do people think i eat too much? are people watching me and thinking about how much im eating? why can't i just fucking *stop eating so much*. and my parents always say something every time i eat smt with sugar. i put jam in some yogurt i was eating, someone had smt to say. 

and it sucks yk? it's so hard living in a society where everything is j skinnyskinnyskinny. it's so hard hating my body for so long and actually getting to a point where i like my body only for my doctor to force me to gain ten pounds. it sucks feeling like my body is being taken away from me, i don't want to gain weight, part of me doesn't care that i've never properly had a period because i'm underweight.

but the other part of me is justifying every single little thing i want to eat with ""it's fine, you have to gain weight anyways!"" and then i realized that i'm not actually indulging because i want to gain weight, it's just the same little voice that kept me eating and eating and eating before this whole being-forced-to-gain-weight thing.

i had a friend basically tell me ""you don't look that underweight you look fine"" and i wanted to scream. because if im not even skinny now i'm going to hate what i look like after this. why can't you just see?   
why can't you see that i can be skinny and be so scared of gaining weight? why can't you see that it's more about it being good for me and shit, it's about dismantling this entire view i have towards food. im here looking at the scale with dread if i go up or go down.

I feel like I am at the whim of my brains ability to starve, and I’m worried that it might get worse in the next few months. How long can my body put up with this?&lt;/p&gt;

My niece(13) just started this awfully unhealthy diet, she barely eats a day (less than 500 calories). Its been 2 weeks, so its kinda new but everyone is worried about her, and we don't really know what to say to her, so that she will believe that she is so beautiful. 
I feel her suffer but i can't really say anything as i'm not satisfied with my body either. 

She used to be a little overweight in primary, so this is why i think she still don't have the self-esteem, but gosh... i asume they bullied her too, children are soo cruel... But she overcame this too and now she is 7 kilos less and 10 cm higher, she is just perfect now. 

And I mean, she really look attractive, she even pulled of the nicest muscly tights, for what im such a jellyfish.

I used to do measuring by eye with a thread and than i put it around my waist or arm or anything to see, how much thinner i was. For me, that helped a lot so i already told this tecnice to her mom. Besides this Im just trying to be with her and boost her ego any possible way. Hope she will be alright, i really love her and care about her.

So my question is, what do you think, what could have your family help you or say before developing an ed? What would you say to a 13 yo girl at the very edge of ed? What feels nice to hear for someone with ed?

Hello, my name is Lynn Williams. I am an undergraduate student at Rogers State University and am conducting research on the relationship between childhood trauma and the development of eating disorders in males. This research is completely confidential, no personal identifiers will be asked nor shared. 

Approximately100 males will participate in this research. Participation should take between 15-20 minutes. There will be questions regarding childhood trauma, types of eating disorders, and eating habits. These questions have the potential to be triggering or cause emotional discomfort. You may exit the survey at any time. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope your response can help shed more light on this important subject. If you wish to participate in this research, please follow the link to read and sign the informed consent, then continue with the survey. Have a great day.

,eating_disorders,"I have a history with anorexia, and am mostly in the clear now. Having established myself quite firmly in the field of psychology now with a special interest in eating disorders, I'm really keen to do some of my.own research on the less-discussed, nitty gritty things that can so often come with eating disorders.

SO!

I have a big list of questions that may be triggering to some. They discuss in-depth discussion of body checking (to check ones own body either in the mirror, reflective surfaces, looking down at ones self, taking photos) specifically on social media and therefore knowingly public/ open to others judgement. Please try not to read any further if discussions about this topic will be hard for you, I am just genuinely really interested in knowing more about what people think, especially with lived experience, as I see many people online (famous and not famous) get criticism for posting body checking photos and I find myself wondering if these people even realise what they're doing, whether they have any responsibility here, or if this is a Pandora's box of an issue.

As an example: someone posts a photo of themselves on social media and they are very obviously doing a 'body checking' pose (popping the collar bones, shoulders forward, leaning over, weird contorted pose to flex the thighs, etc etc)

1. Is that individual to blame for sharing that on social media and potentially influencing others?

2. Should these people be reported or berated in any way?

3. Are comments about the posing/ weight loss emphasis good or bad? Does your answer change if that person has never looked this thin/ posted such a photo before? 

4. If someone does not/ has not ever shared that they have an eating disorder, are expressions of concern good or bad?

5. Do comments like 'dont tell someone what they should be doing with their body' apply when the person of interest definitely is or might possibly be damaging themselves? Does your answer change for DEFINITELY has a confirmed eating disorder, or not known/ not confirmed or diagnosed?

6. If someone has shared that they have had or do have an eating disorder, does that make a body check photo worse? Is it open to a different judgement?

7. If you have experience of body checking on social media OR in real life (ONLY the kind that is public such as wearing deliberately oversized clothes/ not much clothing/ sitting and posing in front of others in ways to make oneself appear smaller, etc), what do you make of established 'ED accounts' posting these photos, compared to people who post similar photos without a confirmed diagnosis (let's assume these people might be in their initial decline into an eating disorder and might not realise yet, or have realised and are in denial)?

8. Finally, what should we, as a society made up of both people with and without experience of an eating disorder, do to address this? This is an open question, I want to know what everyone feels and thinks about this and whether anything can or should be done.

I hope it is okay to post this on here..

**""But you do not look sick?""**

Well, you do not look like an idiot, but here we are🤪 kidding, heheh ..

Eating disorders are mental disorders, not cultural phenomena .. and unfortunately, I sincerely believe that, when most people hear the word «eating disorder», images appear in the head of skinny and tired bodies .. and it is so sad, because it is so much more, there is so much more behind .. there are different types of eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, arphide, overeating disorder etc .. and no, you can not always see that you are sick ..

It's not easy to see that I struggle with food .. I am ""normal weight"" (whatever that means), and I have never been particularly thin .. I eat in expected situations, and I like to talk about how good the food is .. but; food is my weakness .. a love-hate relationship .. I hate food. And I love food. .. I want to feel in control, which is the opposite of what I feel now .. but there is so much food does for me .. comfort, reward (or punishment), distraction, anxiety suppressant and the intense emptiness inside me is filled , ""Intoxication"", joy, pastime, if only for a little while .. ""it is good to see that you have such a good appetite"" .. well, food is not always pleasurable, but more like a compulsion .. a prison .. but because I might look a little bigger (yes, quite true, but I'm built that way, and it's totally okay), no one suspects I'm struggling with food .. besides, I think as little as possible about myself myself, hoping to take up a little less space, and I think it works, because I am not seen .. I am so ""big"" that I am invisible .. often I think that, maybe if I had been as small as I feel me, then it would be easier, but no ..

no matter how much I want help, our dear mental health care sees eating disorders as something physical .. all that is grilled in the head is weight and BMI .. ""you are not sick enough"", and hey we were back to not looks sick .. no, I do not look sick, but I will promise you that this disorder will soon suffocate me to death, it just does not seem ..

,eating_disorders,"Hey, my name is Martin and I’m from Wales. The reason I’m using this forum is because the support services for eating disorders in Wales is practically non existent and also the stories in this forum were very relatable as I too had a girlfriend who had bulimia . Any advice or webpages I read about ex girlfriends and their mindsets and reasons for breakups doesnt appeal to me nor can I relate to them because a breakup involving an eating disorder is so differnet and unique . I’d love if you could offer me some clarity and guidance to my ex thoights . We met almost 2 years ago and we hit it off straight away . I was only the second person she told about her eating disorder abiut 5 months into the relationship and she assured me that it was under control . I got her to tell more poeole and see her therapist which she was reluctant to do and we argued over this at times but i did let her know how supportive of her and how much I loved her of course aswell. We had a very special connection throughout but last January her eating disorder and mental health started to decline once more . I never knew whether to bring it up and push her to get help or to ignore it and and let her deal with it all by herself . It became almost a third person in the relationship . It affected her self confidence and body image and her libido was extremely low which affected our intimacy and my mental health also . Last April to my surprise she broke up with me to work on herself saying she can’t be in a relationship right now even tho she loves me still. I gave her space for 2 months but since we met up again she’ tried to meet up quite often and it felt nice cus I missed her and we both said we still love each other however she doesn’t want a relationship . 2 weeks ago I told her that as much as I love her i have to respect myself I cannot be friends with someone whom I have feelings for and that we can’t meet again and she did not take this well. She’s been very down since her fiends have told me . I feel like she likes the comfort I give her. She still loves me but won’t be with me and I don’t understand why not . It’s breaking my heart .

The reason I’m using this forum is because the support services for eating disorders in Wales is practically non existent and also the stories in this forum were very relatable as I too had a girlfriend who had bulimia . Any advice or webpages I read about ex girlfriends and their mindsets and reasons for breakups doesnt appeal to me nor can I relate to them because a breakup involving an eating disorder is so differnet and unique . I’d love if you could offer me some clarity and guidance to my ex thoights . We met almost 2 years ago and we hit it off straight away . I was only the second person she told about her eating disorder abiut 5 months into the relationship and she assured me that it was under control . I got her to tell more poeole and see her therapist which she was reluctant to do and we argued over this at times but i did let her know how supportive of her and how much I loved her of course aswell. We had a very special connection throughout but last January her eating disorder and mental health started to decline once more . I never knew whether to bring it up and push her to get help or to ignore it and and let her deal with it all by herself . It became almost a third person in the relationship . It affected her self confidence and body image and her libido was extremely low which affected our intimacy and my mental health also . Last April to my surprise she broke up with me to work on herself saying she can’t be in a relationship right now even tho she loves me still. I gave her space for 2 months but since we met up again she’ tried to meet up quite often and it felt nice cus I missed her and we both said we still love each other however she doesn’t want a relationship . 2 weeks ago I told her that as much as I love her i have to respect myself I cannot be friends with someone whom I have feelings for and that we can’t meet again and she did not take this well. She’s been very down since her fiends have told me . I feel like she likes the comfort I give her. She still loves me but won’t be with me and I don’t understand why not . It’s breaking my heart . She said she went off the rails too after the breakup ( doing drugs drinking a lot and getting with lots of guys ) and she seems to always be out having great times . Any help on this issue would be greatly apprecaite . Thnaks .&lt;/p&gt;

Okay so, my brother and I made cupcakes. they were pretty average cupcakes red velvet with cream frosting, after we made them we put them in the fridge. after an hr or so I went to the fridge and ate one singular cupcake (it was around 6pm) my father saw and went berserk. He started yelling and screaming at me calling me fat and a pig for the way I looked. he started making me feel shit about my body. (im quite muscular and definite muscular features however I do have fat and quite big tits making my body look presumably fatter. Im also a 16 yr old girl.) I genuinely felt like crying. I didn't know what I did wrong. weight and my body is something that I've been hating myself for a very long time, around the age of 10.

My body hasn't always been this big, it got worse after my uncles death around that age, and I found food an away to cope with my feeling. But my parents never liked it and always constantly belted me for it, even going far as to point it out at party and family gatherings. (But I genuinely love my parents but stuff like this hurts).

But todays incident really hit a cord of mine as my father grabbed my shirt and dragged me to the weight machine telling me to weigh myself. after he saw my weight he screamed more and told me to loose 10 kg by the end of this month, he even went far as saying he wouldn't mind me getting a eating disorder out of it.

I'm at a place that I don't know what to do. im upset by my body and that I cant look like other models and even after doing workouts and all these diets my actual fat on my body won't reduce and if it did it creates overneeded muscle that im not looking for.

After finishing 8th grade I ended up moving to a new country and gained weight. I went back to restricting, but I didn’t manage. A lot has happened, and here I am at 17, gained everything back and then some. Every day this week I’ve tried to purge but my body just can’t do it. I’ve never purged before, but it’s not from lack of trying, and I know I’m just gonna continue trying. I need help, I want help, but I don’t even know where to start? Like do I have an ed? Or am just messed up? Can I fix this on my own? I’m just mentally exhausted. I can’t continue like this…&lt;/p&gt;

CW because I talk about my stats, my intake “limit,” etc. not to encourage or discourage anyone, only to provide and honest image.

 
I have been suffering from anorexia for 8 months now. To get a sense of how badly, I’ve officially lost 25% of my original (healthy) body weight. I’m 5’8 and fairly active and eat 1000cals a day most days. 

I occasionally try to loosen my restriction when i am in a happy place mentally. whenever I try to do this, though, i go straight into “survival eating” mode. just, inhaling food until it hurts. Normal adult human amounts of food hurt, the pain of eating even more than that is something else entirely. I want to seize the opportunity to give my body nutrients and a rest from the constant stress of starving. But the way it hurts I can’t imagine I’m healing at all. It’s gotten a little better, it’s been five days, today i ate a normal dinner without having to buckle over in pain for an hour. And for what it’s worth, i do try to give my body things it really needs, not just processed junk food. (Restriction me lives off rice krispies). Also i’m poopin again, which is cool :P

,eating_disorders,"Hello! I just made a very good friend. The other day she told me she suffered from anorexia when she was younger.
Right now, she is thin (not anorexic though), likes to do yoga and still have to control her eating due to a autoimmune disease.

Anyways, soon she is going to move close to my home so we will have time to go out more often, and invite her to my long walks as exercise.

I wanted to know, first, what things I can say and I shouldn’t say. Many times, I can say “damn, Im so fat right now” (which Im not, but you know, we all say that shit). Or maybe talk about my body goals, or “Im not gonna eat that chocolate because Im fat”. So please, would you guide me how to approach conversations about food or control. Or what I should totally avoid to say.

Secondly, I’d like to know what signs I should be alert in case she falls again into restricting her food. I think she is very strong, because recently her dad passed away and although she was sad, seems like she didn’t restrict her eating.

,eating_disorders,"TW: ED. BODY TALK. Triggering reference to body. WEIGHT. Sewer slide mention

Seriously be careful. I tried to write this the best way possible for understanding and consideration of the platform audience

I not sure where to put this but I'm sure someone here will understand. 

I gained quite a bit of weight because my depression and anxiety pretty much locked me in my house. I didn't move or do anything but watch TV for 7 months. The whole time I was worried my bf wouldn't love me because I thought I was ""fat"". At the time he was in a bad way and said he'd leave if I was fat with no reference as to what that meant. (We've since then recovered and developed knowledge and understanding of what that caused and how to move forward). Besides trying to unalive myself this had been the longest, hardest, most mentally exhausting existence I'd ever had.

Over this time my ARFID got really bad and I was only eating 5 or 6 things. None of which had high value.  Over time I was able to adjust it a bit. I've added fruits and veggies. A few types of meats and ensures to assist.

Now that I'm doing much better but still not eating much I've lost all the weight and then some. I haven't weighed this much since I was 20 (now 25) and worked 2 jobs and went to the gym for 4 hours a day. I'm slowly going under my lowest weight ever as an adult. That scares the heck out of me but part of me wants it to keep going. Even though I'm not actively doing anything to cause this. 

I know it's the ED talking but I looked in the mirror and got so excited that my stomach was flat (my biggest insecurity and showed worse with more weight) I feel a lot of things about this. I was excited I ""look thin"" but also guilty that it's the ED that made me like this. I wish it was healthy but I was so excited. I see it all over my body where I've lost muscle mass and feel it during my activities but I'm partly just glad I'm finally ""thin"" without trying for the first time ever. I feel shame and disgust as this is not healthy and I know better.

,eating_disorders,"TW: excersize addiction, counting calories 

Hello I am 24(M) and looking for some advice because I really don’t know where else to go. I recently had a major mental breakdown after a year of over excersizing and under eating. I was counting calories and eating  a significantly low amount of calories for about six months and started to slowly increase my calories but I fear I was too late. After one year of under eating, intense weight lifting and working out for six days a week for two plus hours I started to have severe fatigue, anxiety and panic attacks and body aches. I lost a significant amount of weight but according to the bmi scale I am considered a healthy weight. I did blood work and realized my body was in starvation mode and my testosterone had dropped to ninety eight (the amount of a seventy year old man). I am now on antidepressants, anxiety medications and have gotten testosterone pellets. It has been two months since I have worked out and my body is always aching and burning. I thought that once I stopped the working out that this would get better but it hasn’t. I’m thinking that I wasn’t getting enough nutrients to repair my muscles and now they are permanently damaged. I am so scared because I feel like I have ruined my life and will always be having this muscle pain. The doctors I have gone to don’t think anything of it and I hate taking so many medications because before I messed my life up I didn’t take any. Has anyone gone through this and maybe understand what I’m talking about in regards to the muscle pain?

,eating_disorders,"I developed an eating disorder when I was around 13 years old. It went on through age 19 or so. I wouldn't eat much and I became obsessed with working out.

Fast forward to now, I'm a mom of 2. In my 30s and the weight has been packing on and staying on for the last 4 years. I've tried to go the healthy route so many times. Nothing worked.

In the last two months, my life has been extremely hard, I've fallen hard into depression and my anxiety has been so bad to the point where I couldn't physically eat or keep anything down. I lost 8lbs in one week. That's where my relapse happened. The rapid weight loss was so satisfying. I havent been able to get myself to eat normally again. I stay hydrated by drinking a gallon of water a day. I eat one meal(dinner) a day. On the weekends, because my husband is home, I do eat a little more to hide my relapse.

,eating_disorders,"TW: General discussion of different eating ‘approaches’? Not sure what the word is for that

First things first, I don’t have an eating disorder. However my eating is really strange, for several reasons, and I was wondering if anyone knows what this is/what I can do:

- On my way to/from school, I find it really difficult not to buy sweets/chocolate. This has been going on for years now, and the idea of buying or eating sweets always makes me feel sick, however I find it so hard not to buy and eat a bunch of sweets.

- This is similar at home; if I have access to sweets I desperately don’t want to eat them but I feel like I can’t not. It’s weird.

- Additionally, I’ve always been a super picky eater; I don’t like ham, cheese, most cold food, bread that has stuff with it or isn’t toasted, salad, etc.

- This means that the idea of a lot of different meals makes me feel sick. However this has begun to spread to most of my favourite foods, including my comfort food.

- I’ve never thought I had a bad relationship with food, and I’m very active and I don’t feel insecure about my body. My only issue is that I’m worried for my teeth, as I find it difficult to brush them often so I don’t want sugar to ruin them.


Any ideas/tips anyone?

,eating_disorders,"TW: Health anxiety.

I feel so scared and out of control. After going ""keto"" and restricting a lot of certain foods, I can't seem to go back from it. I feel so brainwashed or controlled, like someone is watching me eat and critizing me for eating a slice of carrot all day, everyday.

,eating_disorders,"Hi y’all. This is my first post here, so, here are the basics:
I’m 24yo (25 in Sep), Female.

I’ve struggled with anorexia for nearly 10 years, but have been (mostly) working towards recovery for the last 4 years or so. It’s been at a snails pace, and mostly a solo journey (I do try online therapy sometimes, when it’s really bad, or when I can afford it)…

That said, I’ve never managed to reach or maintain a healthy weight. So when I do lapse- or occasionally full on relapse- the side affects tend to hit pretty quick ((I think my body’s getting sick of my sh*t, quite frankly. And I don’t blame it 😅)).

I’ve recently moved, and hadn’t even noticed myself slipping until I stepped on the scale last week for the first time in months (I try to avoid it bc it’s a huge trigger for me). I’ve been trying to eat more the last few days, but know it’s not nearly enough.

And so, now I’m dealing with horrible, almost non-stop acid reflux, and nausea.
I eat? Nauseous.
Don’t eat? Nauseous.

I can’t seem to win here, or make it go away.
I’ve been chewing tums, putting baking soda in water, drinking warm water (sometimes with honey)— all that. 
It only helps for a few minutes or hours tho.

Any advice? 
Other than to “just keep eating,” or to “power through”. I’m doing that- it’s not working.

,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone! The paragraphs below tell my story while asking for advice surrounding my battle with Bulimia Nervosa. I apologize for the length, I just really need help. 


1.  I have been struggling with a bulimia nervosa for about 2 years now. I used to restrict and binge at nights (always purging after) about once a week. For the past year I have no control and usually do it 4-5 nights a week. I am a 24 year old athletic male who played D1 sports in college. I checked myself into a rehab center for substance abuse issues (alcohol and cocaine) last June and that’s when my ED got really bad as I was binging and purging secretly in rehab the entire time 2-3 times day. I spent a few months not drinking after rehab where I continued to struggle. I am obsessed with working out and have severe body image issues. I legitimately feel like everytime I eat, my face and body looks/feels really fat so I restrict. I am 6”4 and usually weigh 210 pounds. Right now, I am 185 pounds (last time I weighed below 190 I was 15 years old) I run every morning before work and lift after. But it doesn’t matter, because I waste all my nutrition when I purge every night. I am seeking advice for how people deal with the weigh gain mentally when stopping a binge/purge cycle and any best practices? 

2. What medication works for people? I have taken ADHD medication since 8th grade and my psychiatrist prescribed me 140 mg of vyvanse a day (a lot I know). I have always taken a high dosage of adderall but was advised to switch to vyvanse. Vyvanse makes me extremely irritable - It suppresses my appetite during the day but as soon as it wears off at night (usually around 10pm right before bed) I end up doordashing $50 of food, sneaking it by roommates and binging/purging. I started taking Zoloft 5 months ago as I have severe anxiety. I honestly feel like the Zoloft has made it worse. I took lexapro a few years ago and remember it having a much better impact on my anxiety. Has anyone had any success with lexapro or any other ADHD medication? 

3. I’m noticing aggressive tooth decay and hair loss to the point where friends and family have noticed. I am seeking advice for what products or vitamins I can take to slow down my hair loss and tooth decay? Any recommended supplements? 

4. I know the other way to stop my hair loss, tooth decay, and other various symptoms is to stop this vicious cycle. My friends and family knew I had this issue last year, but they thought it was under control now. I told them about a month ago how bad it’s gotten and I legitimately need help or this is going to kill me. I know the with the longevity of my disorder and the symptoms I’m experiencing that I should check myself into inpatient treatment. I simply cannot do that right now due to high demanding job. I understand that is an ignorant mindset.  I’m set to see an ED specialist finally who specializes in diet and medication management. I was wondering if anyone has had success with outpatient programs (Sheppard Pratt etc.)? 

5. Sorry for the long post but would love any advice on the following topics listed above (weight gain  -  medication for managing appetite/anxiety  -  nutrients/vitamins for tooth decay and hair loss -   and most importantly if outpatient treatment programs have been impactful.

ARFID

In the last 2 years I've started to wither away. Mentally. Physically. Emotionally. 

My ARFID has gotten so bad I've lost 25 lbs. At my absolute healthiest, I had to workout 4 hours a day, 6 days a week and be strict on food to be a few pounds more than I am right now. I'm concerned as the scale keeps dropping every time I check. (Which is not often out of fear of starting other ED behavior) 

So far I've increased snacks, and made sure to pour more than I usually would for my usual breakfast cereal meal in the mornings. 

I include fruits and very few veggies, and only eat chicken thighs. 

none of my safe foods are over processed or frozen which seems to be a common occurrence in this community.

&lt;p&gt;In the last 2 years I&amp;#39;ve started to wither away. Mentally. Physically. Emotionally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ARFID has gotten so bad I&amp;#39;ve lost 25 lbs. At my absolute healthiest, I had to workout 4 hours a day, 6 days a week and be strict on food to be a few pounds more than I am right now. I&amp;#39;m concerned as the scale keeps dropping every time I check. (Which is not often out of fear of starting other ED behavior) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve increased snacks, and made sure to pour more than I usually would for my usual breakfast cereal meal in the mornings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I include fruits and very few veggies, and only eat chicken thighs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;none of my safe foods are over processed or frozen which seems to be a common occurrence in this community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve cut out all sweets because of emetephobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s extremely hard to eat new foods as my stomach hurts constantly. My emetephobia keeps me from most of them. &lt;/p&gt;

I went to the doctor last month, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to be weighed, but I was too scared to say anything. They weighed me, I saw the weight, and my heart sank. For the past month, I haven&amp;#39;t been eating much. Usually I have coffee for breakfast and an apple and water for lunch. Yet today I weighed myself to see I had gained 6 pounds since my appointment. FML. I cannot win and I am so tired of feeling like this. And it doesn&amp;#39;t help that summer is coming and I have to start wearing revealing clothes soon. I honestly don&amp;#39;t want to leave my house or even interact with anyone ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"today, i relapsed. i haven’t in about… two weeks? i was doing really well with eating, despite eating a lot of sweets throughout the past couple days. well, today i went to a fair alone(none of my friends were available). they had fried oreos and ofc, at a fair, you have to get fried oreos. but they only came in 5 or 10. so i bought the 5 piece one.

i ate four and then threw the last one out, and felt absolutely disgusted with myself.

earlier that day, i had bought an iced coffee and cinnamon puff pastry at a coffee shop i was studying at.

those two factors combined triggered me. i wrnt home and i purged.

here’s my takeaway from what happened today:

it’s okay.

i fully recognize that recovery is not linear. there will be rough days, good days, and days where i relapse. it’s a long journey.

here’s how i deal whenever i relapse:
i curl up in bed and allow myself to feel the guilt and shame associated with it.

then i get up, take a shower, and cleanse myself of those feelings.

,eating_disorders,"TW:ED + Treatment+ Weight gain+ Weight Loss+ B.E+ A.N

I have been struggling with an ED for over four years now,

I had hidden it really well for a while I guess, but my mom had suspected about two years back. She hadn't done anything about it at the time and then back in October signed me up for a PHP program that ended up not being about EDs but about mental health. (Which I have also been severely struggling with) They ended up doing nothing, just letting me sleep the entire time, and not doing anything for my mental health. We had an intake with The Emily Program in which they ended up telling me I was in critical condition and had to move to residential treatment. They never told us when but there was quite a waiting list. My intake was probably in November. My brother ended up coming home from the military sometime in December. (For some quick background, he and I were super close at the time.) I had just gotten over COVID so they weren't requiring me to get tested before I went in because it was within 90 days. I was ALSO just getting into a very new relationship in December. I was at my now boyfriend's house when I got multiple calls from my mom. I had called her back and that's when she told me that I had less than three days before I had to leave. You can imagine my surprise, especially because they told me they would give me a week's notice.

He and I spent every moment from that call to the day I left together. Extending our curfews and did everything we could to get just a little bit more time. I had left for residential on the 28th of December in 2021. They told me 30 days. Then later I find out that my discharge ended up being on the 26th of March...

I also have something called ""Oral Allergy Syndrome""- Pretty much means I will react to certain fruits and vegetables but only sometimes based on when they were pollinated.

My first problem being there was, that anytime I would react to a food, I would get a response from someone saying, ""Challenge it. It's just your eating disorder."" Which is absolutely absurd, it was in my chart, and it was very evident that I was having an allergic reaction. My mother had to call in repeatedly to tell them to which they'd say ""Well she needs to get diagnosed.""- I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED FOR YEARS.

My second problem came from my dietitian. She had given me my goal weight, and though I have an eating disorder, with a jaded sense of normal when it comes to weight, it seemed abnormally high. I had expressed my concerns to my mom once again to which she was shocked. Because my dietitian told her a completely different number. I was livid. My dietitian informed me about how they decide the goal weight. They look at growth charts and fine your ""natural arch"" from before the eating disorder had started. she had told me that my goal weight was in the 80th percentile, but the weight she told my mom was in the 60th. My mom is also in the medical field. And then sent me my growth charts. I had struggled with eating before I was struggling with anorexia. I had a step-dad with binge eating. We kept tons of junk food in the house, and I was gaining too much weight while I was in early middle school. I was developing an addiction to sugar... To which the same dietitian told me ""You can't be addicted to sugar."" But that dietitian refused to believe that my eating habits back then were unhealthy. I have had countless doctors try to put me on diets because of my rapid weight gain back then. So my ""Natural Body Arch"" was inaccurate. Before ALL my unhealthy eating habits, I was naturally in the 50th percentile for weight. But that's where I was when I went into the hospital because I gained weight before I left knowing it would help me get out faster. Understandably so, she didn't want me leaving the same weight I went in. But she refused to accept the fact that it was where I was supposed to be. So she forced me to gain too much weight. (I am also pretty short because I started restricting at the same time I was supposed to be growing. So I am at a whopping five foot one inch.) They ended up discharging me a month early because my mom and I ended up calling the insurance company to explain what the dietitian was telling us. The ED Specialist at our insurance was on our side and agreed to stop insurance coverage so I could get out.

My mental health was going to HELL, while in res. I was mentally worse in there than I was before going in. But they told me ""Your physical health needs to be fixed before you focus on your mental health"" It was driving me crazy. I simply just wasn't allowed to be depressed there. So I got out and was signed up for IDP.

Which I started a couple of days after leaving residential. Which then, was 35 hours a week. From 12-7 Mon-Fri. That was even more mentally draining than residential. It prevented me from going to school, going to work (And getting money... I may be 17 but I have bills I need to pay. My parents don't pay for everything), and having relationships with friends and my boyfriend. I had countless panic attacks from being there. That was about two months and I had my step down a couple of days ago to IOP.

IOP is now 4-7 Mon-Thurs. A LOT less. But I am so tired of treatment. I've been in these treatments since October. I am a Junior in high school and it is seriously starting to affect my grades. I had to drop all my classes except two. The entire time I was in res, I did no school. And now I am at risk of not graduating.

So, this current treatment I am in has a mandatory community meeting on Tuesdays. In which, my parents are supposed to join from 5-7. Mine can't. First of all, my bio parents are divorced and I am not close with my stepfather or stepmother at ALL. My mom works during that time from home, and my stepdad is asleep due to his work hours as well. Because of that, they asked if I had any older siblings available to fill in. One is in the military, one is a state away(Along with my bio father and stepmom), and the last is due in a couple of weeks to deliver her baby. So no. I don't have anyone to ""Fill in"" for my parents. At that point, they told my mom ""We might have to discharge her if there is nobody that can support her."" But at the same time, they keep telling my mom how important IOP is for my recovery. As I was sitting in the meeting last night they had asked me if my BOYFRIEND could fill in. And be in the meetings that my PARENTS are supposed to be in. Oh my God. I love him, so much. And he has been extremely supportive and understanding of my recovery. But I don't feel comfortable relying on him once again for this. And my parents agree.

My biggest problem with these treatments is that I feel like it isn't helping my eating disorder. Now I'm not saying it hasn't I feel like it's just making me so depressed, unmotivated, and mentally drained that I don't have the energy to keep trying to have an eating disorder. This is all absolutely crazy. It's driving me crazy too.

,eating_disorders,There’s a girl in my class who won’t stop telling everyone she doesn’t eat. Like she says it’s because she’s never hungry but apparently she only eats a snack and a little dinner everyday.

But I’m cleared for 2 different treatment centers by 2 different huge names in the ED world.

I’ve heard awful things about Alsana and their past but it all centers around one location and I had a phone conference with their leadership and they were willing to make accommodations so that I would feel ok going forward with the the admissions process 

I’ve also heard awful things about Monte Nido being transphobic (I’m a pan sexual female) and having reviews deleted so they look better.

,eating_disorders,"You know when you eat too much food that you didn't really want and it just weighs on your mind at the end of the day? I'd like to share an experience. 

Okay story time. I went out to a restaurant this afternoon, I came for a spicy wings challenge but decided I wanted a little bit of mac n cheese too, the mac n cheese ended up being too many calories total, which was fine because I only wanted to have a little bit and shared the rest with my parents while trying some of what they ordered with it. I had some of the mac n cheese but it was not what I hoped it would be, and my parents ordered some bland fried food (basically nuggets and dip), which I tried a little but didn't really want to eat. Now we are waiting for the challenge, 75% of my mac n cheese is sitting there bothering me while my parents slowly eat their 1200+ cal meals. The challenge comes along, it's not even that challenging or spicy, and I finish in almost half the time, because I wanted to leave time to clean off the bones. I'm about to go back and the judge decides that the challenge is complete. even the wings (700 cal) are not really worth the calories to me, I tell myself ""one more bite's a binge"", but when my Dad decided to try the spice, I end up nibbling at the bones too. Then I do it again, and again. After the spicy wings there was an ice cream that came along with the wings. I didn't want the ice cream, I tried to share it with my parents but they wanted me to enjoy it. I should have passed on it altogether, but I was interested in the syrup on top. However, I didn't really like the ice cream and after a few spoonfuls I decided I was satisfied, and my parents took the rest to share while I enjoyed my zero cal drink. But then when my Dad gave the ice cream to my Mom, he decided that I should have her (non zero cal) drink. Sugary drinks, boba tea for example, are a serious trigger for me I'm trying to drink slowly, freaking out that there's no way for me to avoid finishing this thing, meanwhile I'm trying to make the most of it by awkwarly switching between my zero cal drink. I tell Dad to try it too, now it's getting passed around like a fucking hot potato. Eventually, we decide to just leave it, and I'm sipping my drink while waiting for Mom and Dad to finish their food, I take a bit, unsure whether I wanted to or if it was just to be social. I then for some reason took another piece of the one with fewer pieces (more cals a piece). I wiped my face with a napkin in order to discretely spit it out, but I find myself taking yet another piece. Now I'm making small grabs here and there for a spoonful of the mac n cheese, a spoonful of the ice cream, and just switching between everything except the leftover of the wings which is covered in napkins and out of my reach. They got it boxed, I realize I didn't really have to eat any of it. I had brought some snacks in my pocket, I end up having a piece, then decide to chew gum while we're in the car as a coping mechanism. I had recently tried to stop coping using gum. 

We go shopping, I get away from my family to use the restroom. I try and I almost purge. As a little bit comes up I realize that it's only probably 1000 calories or so, maybe 2k at most. I convince myself at the last second it's not worth it, but now I know how. 

We stop at the neighbors house to tell them about the challenge. Their mom offers us some apple pie, one slice for me one slice for my parents to share. I say that it's too much for me and she puts half of the slice back. It still feels like too much. I tilt my plate, pretend to finish sweep the crumbs up with my fork, as I get up to discretely throw the remaining pie in the garbage. Conversation goes on, they offer us some of a chicken dish. I take as little rice as possible because I wanted to try it, and two pieces of chicken. I didn't want to eat another meal, but I wanted to try a little bit and it would have been awkward not to. My hands get messy while eating the food, I grab a napkin and wipe off the sauce to try ans save calories. But I end up grabbing another piece.
There is drink in my pocket, I added the drink mix to my water because I thought it would go well.It did, but by the time I'm done with the chicken, I still have more drink left, I end up taking one more piece of chicken. I end up adding more even more water to the cup so I could sip while we chatted, but I knew that I should have just probably poured it out. I feel distant from the conversation while I sip my drink. 

We all get away from the table to talk outside, but I am super tired, and go back into my house. I should have probably tried to catch a nap but I also had to fold the laundry. But I'm so worried about stopping the binge that I just start chugging salt water, not to purge, I guess to feel full/to cope in order to hold off further overeating. 

This has backfired on me before and it just did again 

I don't need satiety. I just need some hope.

I am now too bloated to sleep (I'll have to use the bathroom) and feeling too sluggish to do laundry and it is too close to dinner time to sleep. 

The one good thing was that there was leftover from the large salad I had before going out (to prepare me for the spicy wings), and I would be able to have that for dinner. But the neighbors gave us some of the apple pie, a different chicken and potato dish, and some bread. I end up wandering to the fridge, stressing about time passing. I know that dinner is going to roll around and I am going to have FOMO. I mindlessly grab some low calorie things out of the fridge, mushrooms and such. And then, as one thing lures me to the next, the spoon comes out, and I start taking bits of the fruit that was for dessert, some salsa, more mushrooms, basically everything in sight that seems low cal enough that I might as well. but that doesn't change the feeling of the calories creeping up. I spit some things out, only to mindlessly reach for even more food, I eventually go to start the dryer, still munching on asparagus, I go to throw it in the trash, still snapping off pieces and eating it as I open the lid. 

I run up to my room to fold the laundry that is laying out while the dryer does the second half of it. Still fighting the urge to back down, I grab 2 altoids. This is usually my go to for stopping a binge, and for the first time ever, I end up reaching for a second pair of altoids. 

I was probably on pace to finish folding the clothes once the dryer finished, but at that point, I just layed face down and started crying. For about 20 minutes. 

Now dinner time has come around. I used to ask to serve myself at dinner, as a way of trying to get all the low calorie food on my plate, but as my appetite has gone down, this has just become a burden. I don't really want to say too much about dinner. I get fomo as usual, they end up making me feel guilty and selfish for the time it takes me to serve myself, because I am fumbling through the cluttered kitchen that I tried to not worry about while they sit already served.

I am selfish because I am desperate. 

Anyways, I have my salad, one bread and a little bit of the chicken potato dish. I end up getting up to grab a few more vegetables from the fridge, but when dessert comes around I have the fruit that was for dessert and pass on the pie. Dad insists on each of us having a slice of the cake we had from earlier in the weekend, and I end the day by swiftly putting it in my pocket and being done after finishing the fruit. 

I have started my fasting window about an hour ago as I finish writing this, I still have to fold the laundry, and I'm super tired.

I often look at these kind of days and wonder if it's my disordered tendencies or if it's really just me. I miss when I saw no distinction/ felt no need for one.

to think that 1 day ago I was close to my LW and physically feeling good without even trying to hard.

For me, after comfortably restricting for a good while, this is just one more reminder to never let myself want something.

tldr: Did a spicy wing challenge, wanted a little mac n cheese for old time sake, got pressured to eat more calories than I wanted to throughout the day. The situation combined with me bingeing on my own terms led to me crying before dinner, then still having a bunch of laundry to fold before bed

,eating_disorders,"Have I just been *""waiting around""* for my eating disorder to change?

being locked in the upstairs of your thoughts, (brain-bound, i call it), gives me a dull headache.

there is an art to waiting around, apparently. a craft. have i perfected that craft?

waiting for change, waiting for movement, waiting for difference.

the definition of insanity is doing something over and over and expecting different results.

all this brain-bound thinking requires mental gymnastics. who is in control of whom? am i in control of my body or is my body in control of me? my thoughts bounce backwards and forwards in my head, twisting into tangents and intrusively pushing forward until i finally take action to simmer the thoughts: throw up on the way home into this white plastic bag, crouched in this dark alley way. well now, what did i expect? i picture someone hitting my nose with a rolled newspaper. bad dog!

i thought once i quit starving i would be happier. i would reach this pinnacle stage of adulthood where happiness resided. i would be able to take a seat in it, relax.

i wring words out of a wet rag and they plunge to the floor. maybe if i pick them up carefully, i could describe what's happening? then i could get out? i could be free? i'm like a dim child, putting squares into circles slots.

anyways, waiting around. i check mirrors for years, the same reflection stares back. i eat burnt toast for years, the same emptiness grows in my chest. i drink diet coke for years, the same satisfaction singes my stomach. maybe this time, this year, this moment, the toast and diet coke will do something different for me? i wait.

maybe if i dress it up a bit (dress up this raging-fire of an eating disorder, lol!): i'll layer my dirty starving habits into my personality, knit my actions into my character, weave my eating disorder into my hair and the men that i fuck, tattoo the feeling from purging into my chest (so it permanently resides, Pandora's box), or maybe allow my body to heal over the pain, scarring my eating disorder into me forever, never leaving. i wait.

the times when my eating disorder has been quiet in my life, it feels like standing in a quiet desert. uninhabited, desolate, wasteland. my hobbies disappear. my personality shrinks. my hair falls out. the only song that plays is ""static"" by godspeed you black emperor! on a deafening loud volume (i double dog dare you to sit in a room quietly and listen to that song in its entirety). i wait in the desert. i wait and wait and wait.

i have not waited around stagnantly, either. i have moved metaphorical furniture for years, making new rooms in my head. i have changed, i have adapted, i have matured, i have seen therapists. and yet, in every version of my new Self, i seem to be waiting around.

maybe if i bleach my insides? strip all the wallpaper, gut my veins. oh, i can smell the sweet smell of sanitary doctor's office now. nice and clean.

here's my secret: when i hear/listen/see young girls (sorry men, can't relate to you as well. no offense) talk about their blooming eating disorder, i want to beat the shit out of them. there they are, just fertilizing their thoughts and tending their depression garden. they're feeding the god-damn thing! they're making a home for it! what! the! fuck!

here's my second secret: i have tended my depression garden for years. i made a fire for it, got it a chair, and made it comfy. i'm projecting my self-inflicted anger onto younger girls. i just don't want you to do the same as me, man.

the real secret of this post: i know when i'm old and on my deathbed, with white porcelain hair and opaque blue eyes, my true regret will flash before me like a series of silent videos. videos of me silently waiting around, doing the same thing over and over.

,eating_disorders,"


idk what im really meaning too say with this post, but since about mid feb ive been actively getting better- and embracing it this time instead of scrambling too feel in control &amp; like im deeply engaged in my ed. 

beginning too eat consistently, ive been trying let go of that feeling of urgency that i needed too get back into a mindset &amp; routine that enabled &amp; fuelled my ed instead  just allowing myself too engage in nourishing myself properly - and rly meaning it with no plan or end goal too make up or relapse. (i dont know how well im explaining this lol but oh well)

ofc in the past month or so there have been slip ups &amp; its all far from consistent. i think i still havent realised how many disordered thoughts r still lingering and whilst that comforts me i am now in a place where i can identify that its my ed that wants and clings too them thoughts and I myself can make the decision too tackle them or listen too them. being able too distinguish what *I * think vs what my *ed* thinks now is crazy ! 
actually quite proud of myself ahh !

I feel like im embracing 'recovery'? (word creeps me out lol cause it feels too official and final but whatever) too fast sometimes or not doing it right. almost wishing it felt harder or im not struggling enough. but then i think abt the 4 months or so before when i knew part of me desperately wanted too get better and i was fiercely pushing it away and fighting it off with fuelling my ed further cause i was just so scared. i kinda consider that period that id wanted &amp; was ready too recover for longer than i thought. and theres no such thing as too quick:)

honestly just taking it day by day lol i could wake up and completely change my mind tomorrow but at least ive seen what recov can bring and how good it can feel:) 
i think im just writing this too acknowledge how far ive come myself. 

No one in my family knows abt my ed in the first place &amp; i think my friends just think im still engaging in it. I've thought abt telling my best friend how things have changed recently but thats scary and feels like ive gotta commit too it then😳

So I've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now, when we started dating she was in a rough spot and undiagnosed with anorexia, a few months into dating her parents sent her to a recovering hospital that focuses on eating disorders. Things happend there that are a whole other topic, however she got back after about a month being there and obviously there was a change in physical appearance by becoming healthier, I stuck with her the entire time and it's been over a year now shes been out. Since she has been out she has still struggled mentally with her disorder but hasn't ever completely relapsed. I'm very proud of her and I dont hold her to any expectation except to keep doing well and trying to help her not hard relapse. The issue I'm struggling with though is ive gained a pretty significant amount of weight since she has gotten back, I'm not saying it's her fault but I do know a part of why that happend is because anytime she would eat or get snacks she would ask me if I wanted some and if I didnt she wouldnt want to be eat it and because of that I didnt want her to not eat so I ended up eating alot more than I normally would snack wise and everything and I have gained about 40-50 pounds over the past year give or take. Again not saying it's her fault but I know it played a role. I've been at a point of wanted to lose that weight back for a few months now I just dont know how to go about it while keeping her in mind because I know it could make her want to work out alot and lose weight as well. Obviously there is nothing wrong with a healthy workout routine but I'm afraid she would go to an extreme like she has before. I want to get back to my healthy athletic weight without making her feel insecure or uncomfortable and I just dont know how to go about that. So if there are any suggestions or anything I'd love the advice.

I have ARFID which is Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. The texture, smell and taste of most food is repulsive and it keeps me from eating most of the time. It had nothing to do with weight loss at the beginning and I was really scared of how much weight I was losing especially since it was accompanied by a lot of tremors and weakness cause of my low nutrient intake. I've told my mom about this multiple times and she's just been happy that I'm losing weight.

I've been overweight most of my life. She's overweight as well and has serious body image issues that she also projects on to me. She's been calling me fat my entire life while doing nothing to encourage healthy eating or exercise only unhealthy diets.

Now that I've lost about 40lbs in 3 months she finally likes how I look and has been praising my body. Now I'm worried to gain weight again cause I don't want to deal with her comments about my body anymore. My ARFID is triggered by stress caused by school. So once that calms down it might go away. When that happens and I'm eating the amount of calories that I should be I'll probably gain weight again.

I don't know if I will go back to eating a healthy amount of food when most food isn't repulsive anymore. If I gain weight I know my body image issues will get worse.

,eating_disorders,"For the entirety of my relationship (going on a year soon), I've had an eating disorder (Not sure exactly which one specifically, I originally thought anorexia and now I'm thinking bulimia... restrictive in some way, I digress). Anyways, my girlfriend has always been insanely supportive of all my mental health issues (cause boy is there a lot) and I appreciate her so much for that. That being said, in the past 3 or 4 months my eating disorder has gotten a LOT worse. I've had a pretty bad eating disorder for 2-3 years now, but it had mostly just been restriction, and now I've been purging a lot. It began around the beginning of the new year when I purged a few times in one week (which had never happened before), and I told her I was scared. I've gotten so much worse since then. She was supportive as ever, but since then it's become a nearly every day, maybe even a couple of times a day thing. She won't say so, but I think this is really putting a strain on my relationship. She really wants me to get help, but I really don't think I want to. I know I need help, I can feel the physical strain this disorder is putting on my body... I just can't bring myself to want it.  I don't want to be dishonest with her and I try to be as transparent as possible, but I know she's also going through her own shit as well. I don't want her to have to be my therapist (I have no therapist), but I also don't want to hide things from her. I feel so shitty, but no matter how hard she tries, I can't make myself want to recover. No matter how hard *I* try, I can't make myself want to recover. I have issues other than my eating disorder and have numerous mental health problems and am a teenager living in a not-so-great home, and all these factors make it harder for me to get, or even want to get help. I guess I'm kind of just venting here, but I just don't want to ruin my relationship because of this disorder, but I don't have it in me to recover yet either.

If context helps, I will be graduating high school soon and will be on my own then. I'm thinking of maybe pursuing help once I am on my own in college. Despite what she may say, I don't think that given my current family situation, getting help is feasible. No clue if this will give anyone a better picture either, but I am a lesbian, so we are both girls (well, I'm not *really* a girl, but for simplicity's sake, let's just go with that) if that gives you any more insight into our relationship?

Anyways, my girlfriend has always been insanely supportive of all my mental health issues (cause boy is there a lot) and I appreciate her so much for that. That being said, in the past 3 or 4 months my eating disorder has gotten a LOT worse. I&amp;#39;ve had a pretty bad eating disorder for 2-3 years now, but it had mostly just been restriction, and now I&amp;#39;ve been purging a lot. It began around the beginning of the new year when I purged a few times in one week (which had never happened before), and I told her I was scared. I&amp;#39;ve gotten so much worse since then. She was supportive as ever, but since then it&amp;#39;s become a nearly every day, maybe even a couple of times a day thing. She won&amp;#39;t say so, but I think this is really putting a strain on my relationship. She really wants me to get help, but I really don&amp;#39;t think I want to. I know I need help, I can feel the physical strain this disorder is putting on my body... I just can&amp;#39;t bring myself to want it.  I don&amp;#39;t want to be dishonest with her and I try to be as transparent as possible, but I know she&amp;#39;s also going through her own shit as well. I don&amp;#39;t want her to have to be my therapist (I have no therapist), but I also don&amp;#39;t want to hide things from her. I feel so shitty, but no matter how hard she tries, I can&amp;#39;t make myself want to recover. No matter how hard &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; try, I can&amp;#39;t make myself want to recover. I have issues other than my eating disorder and have numerous mental health problems and am a teenager living in a not-so-great home, and all these factors make it harder for me to get, or even want to get help. I guess I&amp;#39;m kind of just venting here, but I just don&amp;#39;t want to ruin my relationship because of this disorder, but I don&amp;#39;t have it in me to recover yet either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If context helps, I will be graduating high school soon and will be on my own then. I&amp;#39;m thinking of maybe pursuing help once I am on my own in college. Despite what she may say, I don&amp;#39;t think that given my current family situation, getting help is feasible. No clue if this will give anyone a better picture either, but I am a lesbian, so we are both girls (well, I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a girl, but for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake, let&amp;#39;s just go with that) if that gives you any more insight into our relationship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess all I&amp;#39;m asking for is advice from maybe someone who understands. I don&amp;#39;t want to put all my baggage on her, but I also don&amp;#39;t want to be dishonest with her.

today i purged for the first time in months. i was never trying to recover, but purging has caused me minor issues and i do worry about the effects. 

i feel no guilt. well, i did when getting ready to purge, but during and after i didn't. but i didn't get the high either. 

maybe it's because i barely got anything up. i had just eating 2 large choc chip muffins and all that really came up was the water i drank. i have up bc it was going everywhere and i got so tired. ive had my ed and have been purging for 10 years. i always feel weak after for like an hour. but that was 3-4 hours ago and i can hardly stand bc i have no strength. my chest hurts. i feel like i can't get a deep enough breath. i can't walk even 2 seconds (not exaggerating) without having to stop and bend over to catch my breath. im 99% sure im fine, but there will always be the worry. what if i have heart problems and don't know it and am going to give myself a heart attack? but why isn't that enough to actually stop me? 

im sure it's becoming a regular thing for me again until (tmi?) 5 fingers doesn't even work anymore (why does that always happen? i feel like it's just me). i don't know why i wrote this. i guess because there's no one else to vent to about it and i wanna be told im okay. &lt;3",t2_4nir73mu,False,,0,False,purged for the first time in months — tw,[],r/eating_disorders,False,0,,0,,False,t3_tpts5s,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1648416797.0,text,0,,,text,self.eating_disorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;trigger warning / content warning !!&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Edit: I am insane.

This is a lot to read, so thank you. Last paragraph is the most meaningful to me, so skip there if you’d like too.

I started off with a binge Ed when I was younger, gained a lot of weight and felt bad about myself. And at some point in the past couple years or so  I starting exercising or restricting after binges to “be even” so I wouldn’t gain weight and eventually so I would be losing 2lbs a week. Which is a “healthy” amount to lose but I didn’t do it in a healthy way.

Everyone I know has congratulated me on my weight loss (52lbs) and I just went from obese to overweight on a BMI chart.

I was thinking the other day and my brain thought it would be a good idea to swap to just not eating, or having negative net calories. I mean if I didn’t eat I would lose weight faster. Plus I had a reallyyy bad binge. So I planned on eating next to nothing just a week to make up for it.

So for the past five days I’ve ate on average 200 calories a day while doing 25-30k steps. I’m cold, confused, sore, and dizzy, but gosh darn it the high from not eating, plus all the steps is euphoric. I feel like after just 5 days it’s becoming an addiction. 

Going on multiple jogs and walks a day to get my steps in makes me somehow feel more energetic than I’ve ever been in my life. I have so much energy but it’s like I’m not awake at the same time. This is fun, I’m having fun, and I don’t want to stop… 

Sneaking around my house, lying to people about eating. Sneaking out late at night to jog. I’m a straight A introverted student who is super nice to people. I don’t smoke, do drugs or half the bad things other students do. 

Now I’m lying and it feels so good.. 

Every time I get chills I smile.

Every step goal I set another.

Just 2000 more, just 1000 more, more, more. 

The sight of food makes me nauseous now, before I would feel guilt after eating but now I feel guilty for even making food to be eaten.

No one cares when you have a binge Ed. You are just fat. When you have bulimia and are losing weight at healthy pace-even if you say out loud, “I ate a weeks worth of food last night, so I’m exercising it off”-no one cares. I’ve had people tell me I’m really dedicated for that. But my brain just wants me to reach the label of anorexic, which has a weight requirement, and since I’m starting off the top end of overweight it will take me a while, but it’s all I want right now, and what I’ve wanted for 3 years.

&lt;p&gt;so i was really happy that i started pooping once, sometimes even twice, a day when i started drinking bone broth. and so i didn’t feel bloated or anything like i usually did. and i felt really good mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, this weekend, i kind of ate a lot of junk food. i mean had a lot of cookies and the  fast food for the first time in literally months friday night, then ate out at applebee’s for lunch saturday and had ice cream for dinner. and i’m constipated again. pebbles on saturday and nothing today.&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"So I have a unique eating disorder, caused by medical trauma. Basically, I had a 2 pound ostrich egg-sized tumor in my abdomen, which made it very hard to eat for years, along with making me very self conscious(it made my stomach very large and I looked pregnant). In 5th grade I got it diagnosed and removed, and went through a pretty major surgery in which I came out of with a c-section type scar and medical ptsd(diagnosed). I've been struggling with eating problems even after the tumor was removed, and I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. I was wondering if anyone has any idea if there is a category for my eating disorder or not, so I put the description below. Please DO NOT read if you're worried it might trigger you.

&amp;#x200B;

My eating disorder I think is caused by two main components. The first part is the fact that my brain isn't aware that the tumor is not there anymore, so I still feel physically sick when I eat too much(this is because the tumor was so large it pushed on my stomach). The second reason is a bit more like anorexia, but still induced by my medical trauma. I'm so scared that I might develop the tumor again(which I actually just did at a much smaller scale, so that doesn't help) that I try to make my stomach look as far away from how it did before the surgery as possible, and I'm terrified of having a wide stomach.

,eating_disorders,"I really find myself wanting to talk about these issues with someone, but everyone in my personal life is too much of a risk to talk to. I can't even open up to my therapist about it very much. The last time I did, 80% of our sessions became JUST about food. Not even about how I process it, but if I actually ate or not. Even though I had a dietitian I was working on that stuff with. 

I have to keep it secret from so many people and so many spaces... I don't have a support group for this and I'm not sure one exists. ED support groups sounds like a bad idea where everyone is just comparing against each other. I've never found one, anyway. 

In treatment isn't an option. I have a day job and no money for that. 

Already in therapy. 

Friends are too risky to talk to because they will get TOO involved and know all of my shit and I can't have that. They also are susceptible to being triggered by ED so I can't talk about that for such reason, too. 

I really want to talk to someone trans about it because I myself am trans and ED messes with that in so many ways, but again, I can't bring it up to people I know. 

I'm so down about it all. I'm trying so hard to keep my number (weight) stable, but it's so hard and I'm so alone. Don't get me wrong, I don't need validation or encouragement, I just wish I wasn't by myself in being the only one who understands what this is like. 

I also am hopeless when it comes to recovery. I'm finding it harder and harder to FIND recovery stories let alone LIVE one. Every story I know seems to end in relapse and from there it just goes yo-yo again. Recovery, treatment, restoration, relapse, repeat. Does anyone ever get away from EDs?

I followed those instructions and it was alright at first until I suddenly started vomiting again. In hindsight, I only started vomiting toast after I started getting bored of it and craving other foods.

I was then told to go 24 hours without food and to try toast again. I did so and vomited it immediately after I finished it. I had been craving some biscuits on my desk and ended up giving into it, both because I was extremely hungry and just desperate for flavour. For some reason, I didn't throw up the biscuits. 

Immediately, I assumed I must be having a reaction to an ingredient. I tried a couple more things and discovered that chocolate was totally fine but salted crisps and pain-au-chocolats weren't okay, and would quickly get vomited once I finished them.

On a whim, I decided to try a flavour of crisps I preferred more, prawn cocktail. For some reason, I didn't vomit this. This didn't make any sense to me as these had all the ingredients in the salted crisps and more. This then lead me to the possibility that I'm not vomiting from any sort of allergic reaction. Instead, I'm vomiting over a cognitive reaction. Looking back, the biscuits, chocolate and favourable flavour of crisps were foods I really wanted to eat and everything else was foods I was okay with. 

I've gone almost 21 years without having any kind of food allergy or eating disorder. This has come on very suddenly and I'm making a post here in the off-chance someone might know what's going on with me.

I've had this before with low potassium, but I'm an idiot and let it go. So the night proceeds and I'm now starting to partially black out while sitting down, and I'm unsteady in my seat like I'm drunk or something, this is a café we're in, and we're not drinking. So I take one of the emergency potassium pills I had (I use to get them prescribed when I abused laxatives, so I have some left over and I use them rarely, in cases like this because I'm stupid and I don't go to the hospital like I should). I was legitimately scared at this point; I had never felt quite this bad before.

I go up and to get a sandwich and some chips. When I was looking at the sandwiches, I almost fell over and couldn't properly read the names because my vision was blackening and was in and out of focus. As I ate the sandwich, my boyfriend brought me an orange juice because he's a thinker, just in case it was low blood sugar, even though I just had cake an hour earlier. I began to get my vision back; that was the scariest part for me, not being able to see, then I finished everything, mentally being screamed at by my ed, and my stomach feeling absolutely awful.

,eating_disorders,"I'm a minor and I think I might have an ed. Food/eating causes a lot of stress and overthinking for me.

Problems really started around December. I started counting calories and felt guilty after I ate. I slept in to skip meals and weighed myself daily.  This lasted for about a month. Then I got back to over eating. I felt like I had no control over what I ate and felt super guilty after. I also gained back the weight I lost and felt really bad about it. I was still weighing myself and still hated myself. I wanted to get back ""old me"" who ate less.

I realized that won't happen and started to panic. I started going on our treadmill daily. When I manage to minimise the amount of food I eat, I'm happy about it for some reason.Tbh I'm always scared this ""control"" I have will go away again. 

It's also common for me to daydream about food. How I really want to eat something, but then the thought of calories and gaining weight stops me. After a while I can't stop myself anymore and eat a bunch of snacks. I sometimes hurt myself just cause I feel so much hatred towards myself.

Then I got back to over eating. I felt like I had no control over what I ate and felt super guilty after. I also gained back the weight I lost and felt really bad about it. I was still weighing myself and still hated myself. I wanted to get back &amp;quot;old me&amp;quot; who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that won&amp;#39;t happen and started to panic. I started going on our treadmill daily. When I manage to minimise the amount of food I eat, I&amp;#39;m happy about it for some reason.Tbh I&amp;#39;m always scared this &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; I have will go away again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also common for me to daydream about food. How I really want to eat something, but then the thought of calories and gaining weight stops me. After a while I can&amp;#39;t stop myself anymore and eat a bunch of snacks. I sometimes hurt myself just cause I feel so much hatred towards myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get triggered by ed-s? Idk how to explain. It simply makes me feel anxious or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly confused. This causes me so much stress. I&amp;#39;d be glad to hear any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Hi all,

long story short, I am a 21 year old male who used to be quite overweight. My coping mechanism for anxiety was to eat, and naturally it caused its repercussions. This habit of mine lowered my will to do things I would normally do when healthier, and my days were moistened of sadness. But I overcame this during mid-2020 and decided to change. Success came to me after jogging regularly. Life became happier. However, I was always obsessive, and I mean acutely obsessive, over my diet; I spat food, did not eat sufficiently, and smoked cigarettes to suppress my appetite, developing an addiction. And it is also worth mentioning that I was still unsure of my body, as I had always been bullied over it by family and peers in a classic manner. I then  licked anorexia closely, while seeing an obese person in the mirror when in reality I was the other extreme opposite. This would sadden me deeply. Then, I started gaining weight again, and now I am overweight because I either eat too much or nothing at all. This is ignominious, and it embarrasses me to write this, because I do not even reveal this to my loving girlfriend. I am humbled, brought down, and beaten by this. I still am obsessive over my body; looking at mirrors, window reflections, and avoiding cameras at all costs happens to me daily. I have thoughts of suicide and self hatred, which is an unwise way to fight the problem.  Nothing can bring me peace anymore, and I cannot exist in ease with myself, accepting my own body which is deservingly hated. I do not know what to call this. Mine is a problem of anxiety, I would think, but I do not wish to diagnose myself.

She told me EVERYBODY (all her friends and herself) have noticed my weight gain....my mom even outright said I got fat on certain body parts.
Everyone said that around February apparently and this was the worst month, our cat was about to die and I couldn't deal well and binged the entire time! 

Now she said that I did gain because of my recently voiced wish to diet (as a way to get her to shut up about not eating at home).
""You'd never loose weight on a diet and gain it back"".
She has a history of doing that.

Then she straight up tells me I used to get skinnier a while back and WITHOUT needing to diet too!
Like no...I was very deep into anorexia and it was in 2019/2020...I remembered because I starved to achieve that body.
She said she was glad for me that time, that I was finally loosing as well.

Now I think I've become bulimic because I keep binging and restricting all the time, I CANNOT be trusted around food.
She even went as far as telling me I ate so much junk in February and it was like I couldn't even stop....yet never questioned that there was something deeply wrong other than ""emotional overeating"".

I feel like I just need to restrict much more so people take me seriously and start being concerned but yet again, their hateful comments trigger me to binge.

,eating_disorders,"Just to Vent
So I just relapsed, starting with cutting my intake down to under 1000 calories with the intention of moving down. I used to restrict significantly lower when I was a freshman in college and that’s what caused me to be booted from that college and in to heavy monitoring of my intake and mental health. About 9 months ago they put me on Zoloft, and while it did help my depression, I gained about 40 pounds in 3 months and it caused me to panic so bad they changed me to a different medication.

Long version:  
My name is Lucie Tsao, and I am currently in Hong Kong. Under the crazy diet culture here and very strict body requirements for women, my life always gets so influenced by them. I have always struggled with my eating habits because growing up even my parents always encouraged the eating disorder behaviors. After I finally got to know the concept of eating disorder, I was able to gradually understand my behaviors and take control of them as good as I could. During my journey, I have gotten to know how little eating disorder is informed to the general public. As a sociology student, I thought I would grasp the chance and dedicate my thesis project to eating disorder. My purpose is to bring more understanding to the subject of eating disorder from a sociological perspective, and even within such a broad subject, eating disorder is not studied about as much as it should.  


For my project, we (me and another girl who has also suffered from eating disorder) are focusing on eating disorder as a social movement, and the major circumstance is eating disorder support group (both online and offline format). Inspired by the AIDs movement and also AA support groups, we think this is a very interesting topic that would bring more awareness to the concept of eating disorder in general, and there is clearly a research gap in this perspective. Because we’re located in Asia currently, it is very rare to find people who have had experience in the support groups.

Anyways, one of my “friends”, Nick (fake name) came up to me, called me anorexic (I get that a lot even though I have B.E.D.), then said, “how do you feel knowing that you will never gain weight or muscle mass no matter how hard you try?” I am totally trigged at this point and yell “SHUT THE FUCK UP” at the top of my lungs with my absolute favorite teacher standing nearby.

During this time my partner never seemed concerned and even praised me for my ""progress"" even though I told them that I was only eating one meal a day (basically about 400 calories). Over the past couple of years I have moved states, started a new job, my partner has transitioned from MTF... a lot has been going on. It's been a really high stress period in my life. Weirdly, I've started medications and completed a long round of therapy and I think my attitude towards food has been better than ever. I have gained a significant amount of weight back since early 2020, more than I lost. I've definitely struggled with this but I figure it is the cost of acquiring a healthy relationship with food. I figure until I stop the restriction cycle, I can't really focus on eating a health-optimized diet anyway. I feel like I'm almost to the point where binges have stopped or at least are no longer out of control.

The problem I'm currently having: I've been having really bad GI issues for the past 18 mos or so. I've always just attributed it to stress/bad eating habits, but I'm starting to think it's more than just that. I told my partner that I was considering getting checked out by a doctor for celiac as a starting point, because I already have autoimmune issues and I want to eliminate that as a potential cause. Before I could even finish she started grilling me about different foods I've eaten and whether or not those caused an upset stomach (I explained no, not always but celiac can develop at any time). Then she proceeded to lecture me for 30 minutes about how she's noticed that I've gained weight since we have been living apart (I moved for work) and that I didn't used to eat so many processed foods. She repeatedly mentioned my weight but would also say, ""of course I'm not concerned about that... I'm worried about your health"". She does biomedical research and so was discussing the role of fructose on metabolism and that she was concerned that I was developing serious metabolism issues. She expressed that she would prefer if I only ate foods that I cook myself and cut refined carbs and sugars out of my diet. 

My issue is this: She is objectively right that this would be an improvement to my health and that the rapid weight gain is indicative of a metabolic issue. But I already have conditions (endometriosis, thyroid dysfunction), not to mention the constant weight cycling throughout my life, that contribute to that. My activity level has also reduced considerably (I also had a major injury requiring surgery 6 mos ago). I'm not saying diet isn't important, but that I really need to get my head straight re: food before I can healthily even consider ""cutting out"" categories of food (yes, even sweets!). I argued that my disordered eating is a much bigger threat to my health than my fructose consumption or even weight gain but she was kind of fighting me on it and kept bringing up my weight gain as ""evidence"" of an issue that wasn't there before.

I get that this probably comes from a place of love, but it really does seem like she is more concerned about my weight than my actual health since she wasn't really listening to my explanation of my average diet and GI symptoms. Any advice on how to handle this? I don't want to punish her for her concern but at the same time, this type of framing is really damaging.

I, (16f) is currently struggling with ARFIDs and have been for the past three months due to ocd and ptsd.

,eating_disorders,"So in June (like 8 months ago) I developed an ed with primarily symptoms of anorexia nervosa. I dipped down very quickly from eating a normal or more than normal amount to (TW numbers) an average of 250 calories per day (it was on a weekly schedule, I had a 2 google docs and a sheet to keep track of everything) and lost about (another tw numbers) 40 pounds in 6 weeks. I started eating a bit more and gradually worked up to a still low but sustainable amount.

But now I'm dealing with some other things. Two different things kinda showed up at the same time. For one, I've begun obsessing on eating healthy (not necessarily less). Secondly, I've also just stopped liking a lot of foods. I can't tell if it's a genuine dislike or if my brain is convincing me I don't like it because I deem it as ""bad"".

(tw for this whole bit maybe? Describing what I eat/don't eat) For context, here's a brief list of what I dislike and think is unhealthy: any meat, nuts, anything with added sugar, butter or margarine, oil, anything breaded, any sauces, potatoes, anything processed too much.
What I'm allergic to: potatoes, avocados, bananas, tomatoes, garlic, onions, nuts, cocoa powder, coconut, dairy (except cheese).
Pretty much everything that I do eat: lentil salad (with spinach, red peppers, and a tiny bit of balsamic dressing), pasta with a sauce made of blended cauliflower, broccoli, and cheese, oats with chia seeds and fruit, smoothie with berries, spinach, and protein powder, and peas with paneer.

If I eat anything that I don't usually, I get really nervous and can't do anything for the rest of the day. There are a few foods that I love but deem as bad (pretty much just bagels and chocolate). These are symptoms of orthorexia right?

But then I also just genuinely really don't like some things, like meat and anything oily. That sounds more like arfid right?

Is there a term for just general ed? Or should I consider myself recovered from an ed but still struggling with disordered eating? I'm still getting enough nutrients but the impact of the constant mental thought is draining.

,eating_disorders,"TL;DR — looking for other binge eaters who struggle with excessive exercise, excessive dieting, fasting, have issues with body image (bodybuilding, having abs, looking muscular or physically aesthetic) and who binge on “health” foods and proteins products. Just want buddies to talk to, support, and keep each other accountable and encouraged.

Hey guys, I’ve battled disordered eating for 9 years, most of it was anorexia that turned into othorexia. This gradually developed into an ever-worsening binge eating disorder.

I workout excessively every day, and fast until 2, 3, or 4 PM every day. I’ll eat a healthy “4PM” breakfast and the around 7 I’ll binge and binge on “healthy-ish” foods (tons of trail mix, dried fruit, regular fruit, protein bars, protein cookies, bowls of rice, lunch meat, etc.). Occasionally if it gets worse, I binge on less “healthy” foods too. Usually this happens every single night — the binges usually range from 1000-3000 calories. 

Any other health nuts, fitness junkies, and excessive exercisers, fasters, and dieters out there?

Just want buddies to talk to, support, and keep each other accountable and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I’ve battled disordered eating for 9 years, most of it was anorexia that turned into othorexia. This gradually developed into an ever-worsening binge eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I workout excessively every day, and fast until 2, 3, or 4 PM every day. I’ll eat a healthy “4PM” breakfast and the around 7 I’ll binge and binge on “healthy-ish” foods (tons of trail mix, dried fruit, regular fruit, protein bars, protein cookies, bowls of rice, lunch meat, etc.). Occasionally if it gets worse, I binge on less “healthy” foods too. Usually this happens every single night — the binges usually range from 1000-3000 calories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other health nuts, fitness junkies, and excessive exercisers, fasters, and dieters out there? &lt;/p&gt;

too simplify it verrry much, what is the defining factor between eds and disordered eating? ive been researching this for ages and from what ive gathered i feel it could be (too be put v basic) the volume that it takes up your thoughts/ actions daily. 

i still find it crazy that purging (assuming it meant more than a one off) is considered disordered eating and not something more sinister. - but then again my idea of disordered eating vs an ed is vastly different and part of me wants too believe that disordered eating isnt that bad/ emotionally taxing as an ed. - again thats only because i want too believe that my issues fall into ed territory rather than disordered eating so ig my opinion of that is slightly skewed ha. 

but regardless, do you think an ed could be more defined in comparison by the amount it takes up in ur life / brain space / thoughts etc are mostly if not entirely consumed by thoughts of food, weight, eating etc. and that although disordered eating and eds can follow similar behaviours etc the defining factor lies mostly in the amount it takes up in ur life (if that makes sense).

,eating_disorders,"hi, everyone. i've been struggling with my relationship with food for at least 4 years at this point, pretty much all of high school. i'm currently 17. i'll be 18 soon. i'm male. i've never had actual problems besides mental stress, but now i'm starting to worry about my health.

my doctor recently informed me i gained weight, which made me relapse in restrictions. it's been about 5 months since then and my body. just. hurts. i know i've lost weight again. my knees hurt all the time from lugging around a backpack that weights only 1/4 of me. my tailbone and butt hurt from sitting on the floor at school constantly. i'm getting really weak.

i want to get better, and i've been trying to eat a bit more recently, but it's really stressing me out. my anxiety around weight gain is rising, and i keep worrying to the point of tears that i'll lose control the second i quit restricting my foods. 

i'm not allowed to have therapy, (sucky parents), so i'm on my own for help. that's why i'm coming here. if anyone could please, please offer the slightest bit of help or sympathy, i'd really appreciate it.

,eating_disorders,"A bit of a vent, I'm not sure? 

For the past couple days, I've been mostly good not purging (that is, up until today, but bad habits die hard), I've mostly just either been starving or extreme restricting &amp; haven't been too worried about that. Then I get the nagging feeling to purge. The best thing I can compare it to is the need to SH (I havent harmed consistently in a couple years now, but I used to struggle with cutting pretty bad a couple years back).

Like is there any reason to? No, but you just *need to*, it's just that urge. I feel like purging has replaced that high that cutting once gave me, or acts in a similar kind of fashion at least. I didn't need to binge &amp; purge, but sometimes your brain just clicks &amp; suddenly you're binging because you just *need* to purge. Admittedly, as much as it sucks, it felt as good as I had hoped. It just felt so fucking familiar?? to have filled my stomach &amp; just emptied it, it just feels?? almost refreshing? It's fucked but it's kinda what I think is happening.

Do others have like a perfectly chill like restrictive cycle going for you, like you might have a piece of food when you really feel drained but you're otherwise chill being restrictive - like that seems to be my healthiest option (ideally the *healthiest* option is I wouldn't have an ED but I'm just trying to make due for the time being) - but suddenly you just *have* to purge? It's so frustrating like why can't I just restrict.

Also, side note to all my fellow people known to purge - I know we all know our mouths are all acidic afterwards &amp; I'm sure many of us have begun seeing less than thrilling effects on our teeth. It's so easily overlooked but please remember you guys can rinse your mouths with baking soda mixed in water (about 1 tablespoon to 8 fluid ounces)!! I don't know how I, someone obsessed with science &amp; these kinds of things, overlooked that baking soda neutralizes acids in the months of my frequent consistent purging, so here's a friendly reminder. I don't want to encourage purging at all but I certainly want to help others out if I can. Some quick tips/reminders for teeth care when purging: don't *brush* teeth immediately afterwards, rinse with water if nothing else is available, rinse with a baking soda solution if possible, do brush your tongue (it can hold a bit of acid &amp; keep it around in your mouth for longer, brushing it up on your teeth) - stay safe y'all &amp; take care of yourselves, whatever that looks like to you",t2_gimjqj5x,False,,0,False,Need to purge?,[],r/eating_disorders,False,0,,0,,False,t3_sxouhq,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger Warning,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1645433277.0,text,0,,,text,self.eating_disorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of a vent, I&amp;#39;m not sure? &lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone. Over the years I’ve struggled with eating. 2 years ago, I gained 50 lbs from binge eating. Then during the pandemic, I was home and lost the weight again. I’m still losing weight and I’ve never been lighter in my life, but I’m struggling. I work out every single day and HARD (sometimes burning 700 calories). In Addition to that, I can only get myself to eat about 1000 calories a day— sometimes 1200 but that is rare and I only feel okay with it if I burned a ton of calories from working out that day.

During the weekends though, I eat over 1200 calories— realistically probably about 1700, which should be normal, but after every weekend thay I’m not disciplined, I hop on the scale and the number kills me. 

Last night I had a moment, where I ate nachos. They were so good, but I ate all of them, and I started sobbing because I wanted to be disciplined this weekend. I felt terrible.

This morning, I woke up thinking to myself that I am done with my poor eating habits and struggling with eating. I’m a 21 year old female, and I should be able to consume at least 1800 calories a day without feeling terrible about it — especially if I’m working out at least 5 days a week! So I decided: “okay. Today is the day where I heal my metabolism, and I work to creating a healthier mindset.”

However, I hopped on the scale tonight before dinner and I had gained 7 pounds from the nachos from the night before, as well as drinking and from eating my hearty meals today. I physically and mentally cannot handle gaining 7 lbs in 2 days and if I continue to eat like this, I’m terrified of gaining weight. I feel helpless and have no idea what to do, because now I feel like I need to go back to 1000 calories a day but I know my thinking is not healthy.

&lt;p&gt;Last night I had a moment, where I ate nachos. They were so good, but I ate all of them, and I started sobbing because I wanted to be disciplined this weekend. I felt terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up thinking to myself that I am done with my poor eating habits and struggling with eating. I’m a 21 year old female, and I should be able to consume at least 1800 calories a day without feeling terrible about it — especially if I’m working out at least 5 days a week! So I decided: “okay. Today is the day where I heal my metabolism, and I work to creating a healthier mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I hopped on the scale tonight before dinner and I had gained 7 pounds from the nachos from the night before, as well as drinking and from eating my hearty meals today. I physically and mentally cannot handle gaining 7 lbs in 2 days and if I continue to eat like this, I’m terrified of gaining weight. I feel helpless and have no idea what to do, because now I feel like I need to go back to 1000 calories a day but I know my thinking is not healthy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice/thoughts/encouragement that they would like to share with me, and if so, I would greatly appreciate it. I just don’t know how to get my life back. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes children as young as 7 years old. Parents living with their greatest fear … that their child will be taken. And so, we entrust those treatment centers with our heart, our soul, our reason for living. Accordingly, we are certainly entitled to demand complete transparency from them.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that our loved ones will always be protected.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that our loved ones will receive the best medical and mental health care possible.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly vet prospective employees and conduct exhaustive due diligence investigating their background.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly train their employees to provide evidence-based treatment with a level of care that is equal to or exceeds the generally accepted standards of care.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly oversee and supervise their employees.\n\nWe are entitled to demand that treatment centers will provide a professional, safe environment where our loved ones will be free from unscrupulous, dishonest, unethical employees.\n\nIn fact, courts have held that treatment centers and their employees have the highest fiduciary duty to those entrusted to their care. They must exercise the highest degree of care for the safety of their patients. Therapists employed by treatment centers occupy a special place of trust and confidence and owe to their patients and their families, the highest fiduciary duty and a place of trust and confidence.\n\nWe are entitled to demand transparency from treatment centers in every possible way, from something as simple as their name to the complexities of their treatment protocols.\n\nBut what if that trust is betrayed? What should the consequences be? What should the ramifications be when a treatment center fails us? When a treatment center betrays us?\n\nLast week, Gayle Devin, the Chief Executive Officer of “Alsana” issued a press release which disclosed alarming information. The release stated in part, “We recently learned that Alsana direct care employees might have been involved in inappropriate conduct involving **a client** receiving outpatient care at our St. Louis program. \\[emphasis added\\] Based on our initial review, the allegations involve significant violations of company policy, and we have taken immediate action, including terminating employees and removing employees who remain under investigation from any client setting.”\n\nLater, Ms. Devin states, “As part of that commitment, we are temporarily halting new client admissions to two of our residential and outpatient programs in St. Louis as we continue to investigate these allegations.”\n\nAnd yet, when the press release is carefully read, additional concerns appear.  First, Ms. Devin states, “… inappropriate conduct involving **a client** receiving outpatient care at our St. Louis program …” \\[emphasis added\\]. The singular word, “client” is used implying that only one patient was involved.\n\nHowever, we know for a fact, that that statement is inaccurate.  There are a number of patients who were impacted. There are a number of employees who were involved. So, why attempt to make us believe that only one patient was involved? And since when did a person suffering from the mental illness with the second highest mortality rate change from being a patient … to becoming a “client?”\n\nIn addition, Ms. Devin’s statement would have us believe that only the outpatient care program was involved. So, if that was the case, why would it be necessary to halt new admissions into the residential programs? If the inappropriate conduct was limited to one patient in the IOP program, why were multiple employees involved and why are two of their programs temporarily not accepting new admissions. For that matter, can we believe that “Alsana” discovered and effectively dealt with all questionable employees? Can we believe that the patients who are left are truly safe?\n\nFurther, where is the next press release disclosing what other steps they have taken since last week? Have the families of all of the remaining patients been informed? What safety measures have been taken to insure the safety of the remaining patients?\n\nEven still, why should we believe anything at this point? Especially since “Alsana” cannot even be transparent about their own name and existence.\n\nMany people believe that “Alsana” grew out of the demise of the disgraced, Castlewood Treatment Center. A demise precipitated by lawsuits and horrific allegations alleged against Castlewood. In fact, on “Alsana’s” website, if you click on the “blog section,” you will see articles written about “Alsana” going as far back as 2012. “Alsana” makes additional representations that its existence goes back as far as 2002.\n\n“Alsana” has attempted to position itself as a separate entity going back as far as 2002 and that it has nothing to do with the issues and problems which previously plagued Castlewood. And yet, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n“Alsana” is not a corporation at all.\n\n“Alsana” is not a limited liability company.\n\n“Alsana” is not a partnership or professional partnership.\n\n“Alsana” does not have its own separate existence.\n\n“Alsana” did not take over or acquire Castlewood.\n\nSo, what exactly is “Alsana?”\n\nA search of the Missouri Secretary of State’s records gives us the answer. A fictitious name certificate was filed on March 28, 2019. **Quite simply, “Alsana” is merely a fictitious name.**\n\nUnder Missouri law, the owner of a Fictitious Name Certificate must be disclosed.  “Alsana’s” Fictitious Name Certificate certainly identifies its owner, the entity which totally controls its overall operations. The entity which is in existence and only wears the Fictitious Name as a public, pasteboard mask. In this case, it should come as no surprise that the owner of Alsana, the owner of the Fictitious Name “Alsana” is …\n\n[Castlewood Treatment Center, LLC](https://preview.redd.it/eacu3me6yfi81.jpg?width=791&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3430184615653afdc2fe6e001fc8a09c15333e7)\n\nCastlewood never went away. Castlewood has always been there, lurking in the shadows. Still profiting and sharing those proceeds with its private equity owner. Castlewood is the modern-day version of Keyser Soze, the quintessential antagonist in the 1995 movie, The Usual Suspects.\n\nAs for those “Alsana” Blog Articles going back as far as 2012 and the past employees who claim to have been employed at “Alsana” as far back as 2002? How can those articles be remotely accurate since Castlewood did not start the fictitious name “Alsana” until March 2019? Before that date, It did not exist at all.\n\nWhich raises the question, if “Alsana” cannot even be transparent about its name and existence, what can it be transparent about? Especially since other patients are beginning to step forward.\n\nWell, litigation may tell. On January 31, 2022, as attorney of record, I filed a lawsuit against Castlewood in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\nTime may tell as to what this case ultimately reveals. It may result in closure that so many people so desperately need. However, it may also result in disappointment to those who seek justice.\n\nWhat we do know is that the courtroom is a crucible in which all irrelevancies and subterfuge are burned away. What we are left with is the truth.\n\nTruth that families can rely upon.\n\nTruth that can sustain those who suffer from eating disorders.\n\nTruth that can bring peace and comfort to some.\n\nAnd Truth that can also bring something else …\n\nRetribution, consequences and accountability to others.\n\n[Lawsuit # 7 - Jane Doe Vs.

Sometimes children as young as 7 years old. Parents living with their greatest fear … that their child will be taken. And so, we entrust those treatment centers with our heart, our soul, our reason for living. Accordingly, we are certainly entitled to demand complete transparency from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that our loved ones will always be protected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that our loved ones will receive the best medical and mental health care possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly vet prospective employees and conduct exhaustive due diligence investigating their background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly train their employees to provide evidence-based treatment with a level of care that is equal to or exceeds the generally accepted standards of care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that treatment centers will thoroughly oversee and supervise their employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand that treatment centers will provide a professional, safe environment where our loved ones will be free from unscrupulous, dishonest, unethical employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, courts have held that treatment centers and their employees have the highest fiduciary duty to those entrusted to their care. They must exercise the highest degree of care for the safety of their patients. Therapists employed by treatment centers occupy a special place of trust and confidence and owe to their patients and their families, the highest fiduciary duty and a place of trust and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are entitled to demand transparency from treatment centers in every possible way, from something as simple as their name to the complexities of their treatment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what if that trust is betrayed? What should the consequences be? What should the ramifications be when a treatment center fails us? When a treatment center betrays us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, Gayle Devin, the Chief Executive Officer of “Alsana” issued a press release which disclosed alarming information. The release stated in part, “We recently learned that Alsana direct care employees might have been involved in inappropriate conduct involving &lt;strong&gt;a client&lt;/strong&gt; receiving outpatient care at our St. Louis program. [emphasis added] Based on our initial review, the allegations involve significant violations of company policy, and we have taken immediate action, including terminating employees and removing employees who remain under investigation from any client setting.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, Ms. Devin states, “As part of that commitment, we are temporarily halting new client admissions to two of our residential and outpatient programs in St. Louis as we continue to investigate these allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, when the press release is carefully read, additional concerns appear.  First, Ms. Devin states, “… inappropriate conduct involving &lt;strong&gt;a client&lt;/strong&gt; receiving outpatient care at our St. Louis program …” [emphasis added]. The singular word, “client” is used implying that only one patient was involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we know for a fact, that that statement is inaccurate.  There are a number of patients who were impacted. There are a number of employees who were involved. So, why attempt to make us believe that only one patient was involved? And since when did a person suffering from the mental illness with the second highest mortality rate change from being a patient … to becoming a “client?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, Ms. Devin’s statement would have us believe that only the outpatient care program was involved. So, if that was the case, why would it be necessary to halt new admissions into the residential programs? If the inappropriate conduct was limited to one patient in the IOP program, why were multiple employees involved and why are two of their programs temporarily not accepting new admissions. For that matter, can we believe that “Alsana” discovered and effectively dealt with all questionable employees? Can we believe that the patients who are left are truly safe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, where is the next press release disclosing what other steps they have taken since last week? Have the families of all of the remaining patients been informed? What safety measures have been taken to insure the safety of the remaining patients?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even still, why should we believe anything at this point? Especially since “Alsana” cannot even be transparent about their own name and existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that “Alsana” grew out of the demise of the disgraced, Castlewood Treatment Center. A demise precipitated by lawsuits and horrific allegations alleged against Castlewood. In fact, on “Alsana’s” website, if you click on the “blog section,” you will see articles written about “Alsana” going as far back as 2012. “Alsana” makes additional representations that its existence goes back as far as 2002.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” has attempted to position itself as a separate entity going back as far as 2002 and that it has nothing to do with the issues and problems which previously plagued Castlewood. And yet, nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” is not a corporation at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” is not a limited liability company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” is not a partnership or professional partnership.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” does not have its own separate existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Alsana” did not take over or acquire Castlewood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly is “Alsana?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A search of the Missouri Secretary of State’s records gives us the answer. A fictitious name certificate was filed on March 28, 2019. &lt;strong&gt;Quite simply, “Alsana” is merely a fictitious name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under Missouri law, the owner of a Fictitious Name Certificate must be disclosed.  “Alsana’s” Fictitious Name Certificate certainly identifies its owner, the entity which totally controls its overall operations.

How do you stop binge eating alone?

What to do when you binge to not make it worse?

And I also have a question, can you expand your life span by starting to have good habits (especially in eating)? Or will I still die soon because of habits of the past? (You don't have to necessarily answer this)

anyway today i ate a bit less bc im starting to feel sick every time I eat or drink and I overhear my mom talking to my dad and saying like ohh everyone else's kids are so normal why can't she just be normal

and I think they were referring to other stuff as well but i just felt so much more invalidated and alone

,eating_disorders,"Rant Section 1/back story: This past month I’m be doing a lot better than normal. My anxiety and tic disorder are reduced. My depression finally feels manageable most days, and my binges have been less frequent. I’ve gotten better at forgiving myself after binges and still choosing to fuel my body with food.

Supposed trigger: My best friend hasn’t been at school for a little over two weeks. I called and texted at least 4 times a day, to get no answer.

She finally called me back on Friday and said she was just diagnosed with depression, and is having a depressive episode. She said she is having suicidal thoughts and to not tell anyone, She never talks about her feelings so this was quite alarming. On Saturday I hung out with her the whole day and she said she felt okay for the first time in a couple weeks. I’m glad to help in any minor way possible.

Present: However, since being told this news I find my acid reflux is flaring up from even broth. And my tic disorder is worsening again, along with my anxiety. I’m tired everyday and don’t have the energy to cook. I’m not eating enough, as I’m barely able to eat anything. I feel physically sick when I look at food and I don’t know what t do. I cant focus well in class and I spend the day thinking about my best friend and calories. I’m cold all the time again, and feel dizzy more often than usual (I have vertigo). 

I honestly didn’t think it was stressing me out that much, at least consciously. I think I’m handling it well, especially having gone through similar myself. But.. seeing as that’s the only thing that changed in the past couple days it’s likely the cause.

,eating_disorders,"First a little bit of Backstory/Context:
My ED started when I was 23, which is kinda unusual I know. (I used to have some disordered tendencies throughout my teenage years. But never to a worrying amount). 
I am now 25 (student) and in therapy for (officially) anorexia Nervosa. Which is well - not that helpful (but that might be another Post worth)- but I am trying my best to still keep the weight gain going. 

My ED was never about weight or locking thin, I think that is a bit more common in „adult ED“. For me it was always more about being in control, proving to myself that I am strong, because I can keep doing x amount of steps, Fasting for x amount of time etc. just keeping up with all the rules that I set for myself. 

I am basically not the typical 16 year old emaciate  girl that cries over eating a piece of chocolate (I avoid certain food, but if I am around people I eat completely normal). 

&amp;gt; If you are here for the question: 

I am not scared of food. Actually it’s the opposite. Food is the only thing that I can think about once I get up. It’s sad, but it is the highlight of my day. I can’t wait for the moment that I am finally eating and once I eat there is no stopping. I basically eat for an hour until I feel completely stuffed. Going sometimes 5-6 times in the kitchen to get more. And afterward I get nothing done for the rest of the day anymore. So far that I schedule my work until I eat so that I can at least get the most important task out of the way.

Every time that something good/bad happens I reward/compensate by (over) eating. Especially food that I don’t usually allow myself (call it extreme Hunger/binge eating).

And I am tired of that.
I just want my day to revolve on something else rather than food or going food shopping (which I basically do everyday. As it again - is an immense highlight for me.)

dont read this if you struggle with any of the things above. but if you feel comfortable with it - i really need some advice.

hi, im 17 and ive stuggled with eating, more specifically anorexia, for about half a year now, though ive been ""recovering"" for the past nearly two months. my friend found out and told my parents, they started getting suspicious about everything = i was forced to eat more than i used to. which is great for starting your recovery and living a healthier life and all, but.. i dont think i was ready for recovery. i know i know, i probably would never have been ready, but still - i havent managed to get rid of any of my mindsets that i had while actively struggling with my ed. i thought i did for a while, because i distracted myself a lot or made myself feel better about eating by making healthier, high-protein meals, but the bad mindset has been creeping back in. even worse, my parents have basically forgotten about this whole thing because its been a while since weve talked about it, and they have stopped asking me if ive eaten enough etc.
so now im just in this weird place - i dont want to be miserable again. i dont want to have to lie to the people i love and feel awful and guilty and hungry and weak all the time. i dont want to miss out on more delicious food just to eat one small portion of the same thing every a day. i dont want food to take over my mind again.
but.. i still cannot get the thought of losing even more weight out of my head. at least now i can recognize the damage ive done so far that i had been oblivious to previously - i look way skinnier than before, and i recently realized that ive lost (very roughly) 1/8 of my body weight during all this time. which is bad. weirdly enough though, ""thanks"" to the weight that i have lost, i dont really.. dislike my body anymore. im actually pretty okay with how clothes look on me etc and i dont really want to be super thin and underweight anymore, especially not enough for people around me to notice / worry about. so i really dont know why i still feel such a strong need to become even skinnier. i havent gained any weight back throughout my recovery, but i havent lost any either - which is obviously the point of recovering - my weight has been stagnant. and i really, really hate the thought of not constantly losing weight anymore. its not enough. i am nearly on the cusp of being underweight and it is so incredibly tempting just to keep going. i want to lose more weight, the people around me have stopped caring again, i have every opportunity to fully relapse into my ed. and i know i need to find a way to stop this from happening but its hard to even start somewhere when my mindset apparently hasnt changed a bit.
i downloaded my old calorie tracker again today, which i planned to never do, but i wanted to know how guilty i ""should"" be feeling about my eating. i logged all the food i ate today, which is probably around my daily average at the moment, and it was just over my old calorie limit that i used to eat maybe half of. i havent felt this gross in a long long time, i still feel incredibly sick just thinking about that number. im sure ive gone over the limit a bunch of times recently, and i hate hate hate that thought. i dont know if i can keep eating like this for even a day from now on, i just want to starve myself again forever and ever. i cant handle recovery. i dont know how to stop myself from relapsing anymore, i feel so awful eating normally, i just want to go back. please help me. i dont know what to do at this point. i never thought it would get bad again, i thought it was just a phase and i was over it and it would be easy because ""i was never really sick in the first place"". maybe was wrong.

I need professional help and in all honesty I think I need to be hospitalized. I don't want to get better. I need the proper help and idk if I can get it.
Nobody noticed when my arms were covered with self harm because I hated my body

Nobody noticed when I couldn't even have my arm graze my chest without breaking down.

My ED is the only way I can cope. It's the only way I feel numb and it's the only way to have control over 1 thing.

Bit of backstory, my mum has had ana and bul all my life and I've been self conscious of my weight since about age 9 roughly. I began thinking of restricting a few years back about age 11 maybe but never did anything. Then 2020 i restricted a bit but could stop at any point ig. But the thoughts have come back, not that they were every truly gone, and now i feel like I'm falling into a trap. I think i chose this because i ""wanted an ED to lose weight"" and now im pretty sure I'm doing this for that reason but i don't fully feel in control anymore. I feel guilty if i eat, barely can eat around others, count calories etc.

Is it possible to indulge in thoughts and then accidentally fall into it? I have no need to need control and i just want to lose weight, i feel like that isnt a valid reason. And also when people say an ED voice, is that like a voice in ur head not ur own or is it like another side of you?

is it possible to enter a partial remission of sorts without making active steps towards recovery? 
im in a phase ig of what would appear as getting better. iim currently gaining weight i think &amp; although id be devastated if it passed out of the UW section on the bmi- (even though its bs), im still not restricting too compensate that much. im not really using many compensatory behaviours but i do still keep certain food rituals etc. 

i am probs stuggling way more than i think. like food is still 24/7 my thoughts the plans too restrict are always cropping up. whenever my eds challenged like eating out &amp; staying away it seems too panic and get worse, but other than that im eating at least maintenance i think and always end up stopping tracking throughout  day because i just loose the reason too. 

i think what i worry is that since right now im not struggling too much compared too other times in my ed, that this current phase wasnt improved though engaging or planning too 'recover' in the sense off WG and less disordered behaviour etc do i even still have an ed like is it still there lurking for the opportunity too grip me again. Is possible for it too quieten for periods of time but like once you've got it you'll have it in whatever form until you commit too a full recovery?  i don't plan on staying in this phase, im just waiting until other circumstances push me down the ed spiral again.  i worry was it even that bad throughout all the different cycles ive been in over the last 18 months if im sometimes able too reach this point of less disorderedness ? and reaching a healthier weight by myself.

,eating_disorders,"When you’re a baby, you learn how to chew food. It’s like breathing, you just kind of do it. I was never taught to chew food. My parents would try to give me solid food, but I’d throw a fit and cry. So I just ate baby food, only two different types because I was picky and wouldn’t eat anything else: strawberry banana and I think an orange flavor. I only ate baby food and drank milk (literally nothing else) until I was 11. I had to hide it from everyone. I’d lock myself in a room to eat when guests were over, I couldn’t go to friends’ houses for long, I couldn’t sleep over anywhere, I couldn’t eat at school, I hid a lot to eat and missed out on a lot as a kid because of it. Oddly enough, I was a super physically healthy kid. I was quite skinny, but I didn’t get sick or hurt much. Skip to the middle/end of fifth grade, I was 11 years old. The baby food finally caught up to me and my body began to reject it. Anytime I ate it, I immediately threw it up. Drinking milk was ok but it would come up with the baby food when I’d attempt to eat it. This went on for a month to a month and a half. I was deathly ill, like I genuinely thought every single day that I was going to die eventually from it. I was in and out of school for that entire time and missed a total of 2ish weeks. When I would go to school, I’d have to sit in the back of the classroom with a pillow and a blanket and try to sleep and relax because my teacher noticed and felt bad. My family doesn’t really trust doctors so I never went to see one, but I told my school that I did because how do you tell them that you didn’t? They asked me everyday for a doctors note but I never brought one, luckily that was my last year at that school and there was only a couple months left. Anyway, one day I went to McDonald’s with my mom and sister and I decided to try my first solid food which was their French fries. I was instantly hooked. I stopped eating baby food and I became addicted to McDonald’s French fries. I always say that if it wasn’t for me drinking milk for my entire childhood, I may not have gotten as far as I did. Deada$$ I swear by milk for saving me to this day. This eating habit still affects me to this day. Once I find a food that I really like, that’s all I wanna eat and I get addicted to it. I was addicted to McDonald’s French fries until I was 16/17 years old. I found friends who helped me try new things. I’m 22 now and I’ve branched out and I eat different things now, but not like a normal person. I eat the same 9ish things daily and I still fear trying new things but I’m much farther than I was. I’m much healthier now but I still have a very very long way to go as I’m not where I’d like to be at all and I’m still not fully recovered from it all considering the baby food stuff took up literally half of my life. Chewing is still something I struggle with too so certain foods and I don’t get along because of it. I take forever to chew meat, like literally forever and I’m always the last to finish my food when I go out to eat. I’ve been shamed and made fun of for it many times so it does make it harder to progress. 

I want to leave off with a question. 
Is this something that anyone can relate to? If so, I’d love to hear about it as I have always felt like I’m the only one who’s went through something like that and it’s made it worse on me.

well, those mindsets really resurfaced today when i was changing and for some reason decided to take a bodycheck. i then compared it to the last bc i took before starting recovery, which was obviously a bad decision. the gaps between my legs have gotten a bit smaller, meaning i had gained fat in my legs. its the tiniest difference, barely noticable to anyone else but me, it mightve even just been the angle. but that broke me down so incredibly much. i sat down next to my mirror and cried and hit myself in the head and felt sick at how disgusting i had become. it completely knocked the wind out of me and i still havent gotten up, im sitting with my back against the mirror, its been maybe half an hour. and all the self-destructive thoughts ive been able to work around for such a long time all just resurfaced.

I lost a ton of weight and I got so many compliments. Easy enough I returned to my old eating habits but I think I started yo-yo-ing? 2021 I cut off a lot of foods and I eat 2 times a day. I had to go under surgery and it helped me lose more weight. People started commenting that I got skinny but I just can't see it.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a teen and when I was about 9-10 years old I was picked on by my chubby face and thick thighs (looking back I was a normal sized kid). It finally got to me and approximately for about 5-6 months I starved myself - cut carbs, sugars, gluten. I was eating once a day which was usually either yogurt or a salad. I lost a ton of weight and I got so many compliments. Easy enough I returned to my old eating habits but I think I started yo-yo-ing? 2021 I cut off a lot of foods and I eat 2 times a day. I had to go under surgery and it helped me lose more weight. People started commenting that I got skinny but I just can&amp;#39;t see it. 
(I forgot to mention that every time I eat I feel guilty and cry at night I even locked myself in my room because I&amp;#39;m fat) 
 I got myself a scale for Christmas and the numbers are only going up. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

,eating_disorders,"My partner told me last week that he doesn't like how I look now and that he thinks my bones are disgusting. It made me realize how differently we view bodies and it made me feel kinda iffy. 

I am at BMI 21 rn and while I am currently still engaging in some unhealthy habits, I am eliminating them and plan to stay around this weight in the future with healthy eating and exercise.

I don’t know what to expect in responses. I don’t usually get anything anyway. I want to feel heard. Like what I’m saying actually matters and isn’t fluff.&lt;/p&gt;

I've been suffering  with an eating disorder for about 5 years now and since entering recovery have been more interested to see how other people feel (diagnosed or not; believed to have and ED or not) surrounding their attitudes towards eating. The questions in my survey also ask about body dissatisfaction and social media usage in relation to your gender identity (enbys included!).

If you're 18+ and interested in participating, and are not triggered by answering in relation to EDs, please feel free to click the link below! The survey should only take about 5 minutes but your participation truly means a lot to me!

i cant really remember the time that i was in my eating disorder. I also cantremember anything about my recovery. I just remember that i have stayed home instead of going to school but i cant remember what i did, i cant remember what i felt… and that is a horrible feeling.

when i started eating again my family was so happy. I had such extreme hunger that i couldn’t go 30 minutes without eating. I know it was normal but even back then it scared me. It took controll over me and it just made me feel sick and uncomfortable. I told my mom that i didnt think it was normal anymore. but she didnt believe me. I told all my doctors, my dietitian and my therapist but all they could say that it was normal and that it would stop. I told them that it made me feel so horrible, i knew it was serious but no one believed me. i got back to an healthy weight, but it didnt stop. my hair stoped falling out, but i couldn’t stop. I got my period back, but i cant stop! But still no one believes me. No i am binging probably every single day. I feel horrible. i cant describe it in words. 

Today i am overweight and the unhappiest i have ever been. 

not so long ago (maybe 3 months) my therapist diagnosed me with mild depression that was probably caused by the covid situation where i live (i live in a foreign country since amost 3 years and haven’t seen my relatives since 2019). that time i had self harm thought but have never acted on them because i was so scared.

It honestly didnt surprise me. Ever since i can remember i was never really happy. I always felt less worthy, lonely, unlovable, stupid, ugly… ever since i was a kid. my family moving and being in lockdown was the main reason for my restricted eating. 

&amp;#x200B;

well, this happened in the past. two days ago my school got closed and we are in lockdown. 

All the memories are coming back. All the restrictive thoughts came back, all the body related thoughts, the hate the disgust. And to make it worse My depression has kicked in and i have these wishes again. And i don’t know how to handle it. All i can really do is cry and listen to music. 

I don’t want to turn to my mom. Right now she is so happy because i am at a healthy weight and i went back to scholl, meet friends all that stuff. I know she means well but i feel so bad. i don’t want anyone to see me backseat i am embarrassed. i am miserable and i don’t know what to do.

,eating_disorders,"I've been in my first inpatient program now for 12 days. It is a government funded program where I live. I have so many concerns on my mind and I was hoping for some feedback or guidance. 
Firstly we are on the general psych ward. Which means there is 49 general psych patients and 6 of us. This is beyond scary as there are criminals, perverts and many others with psychiatric disorders who wonder in our rooms and  steal our belongings.  Happy they are here for help but why have we been tossed in the same ward? 
As most of you know our Ed's are result of trauma. Once I arrived I was told there is no trauma therapy in the program. This program only interrupts our symptoms and neutralizes our relationship with food. 
I dont know how I'm supposed to leave here with a mountain of trauma still on my plate. 
They have also taken away the body image program as well. Not all of my peers but most struggle with this as well. Great, the two things which are the root of my ed won't be addressed, what's the point ot being here. 
I thought we would be supervised after each meal or kept together so it would be more difficult to act on our symptoms. Nope we eat and everyone goes there separate ways. Making it very easy to hide our symptoms and act upon them.
I'm also type 1 diabetic and we are forced to challenge cafe desserts each week. This means a piece of triple chocolate fudge pecan cake, or a slice of pie and an enormous butter tart have to be eaten at a meal.  I've been told that I have no choice to eat it, even if my sugar reads 15 or above.  I've tried to explain to them that this is going to put my body in danger. They have responded by saying they will make sure I have extra insulin available when that day comes. WTF?? When I leave here I will still be a T1D and never eat 30 to 50 grams of sugar if my blood sugar reads over 10. 
They have told me to put my Diabetes on the back burner for now as I'm here for my ED. 
We are also in full lockdown as there is a covid outbreak on our floor. They aren't testing patients before they are brought to the ward. Thankfully we have all tested negative but the general psych patients are testing positive as they wonder the halls all day and most won't wear their masks. There are a bunch who are anti-vaxers and making it so hard on the nurses. 
We have been confined to our rooms for 3 days now and they said possibly 10 in total. 
I'm already sliding into a deeper depression as there is only so much TV and reading I can do, I don't nap which leaves me alone with my thoughts making my day incredibly stressful. 
Not being able to just walk our normal eating area and eating in our beds makes horrible thoughts race through my mind. What I'm eating and not having any type of movement afterwards makes me immediately think weight gain. There is no activity to counter the food we are eating.

,eating_disorders,"Hello, 
I’m in my late twenties and during the last two years I’ve gained a little over fifty pounds. My story starts when I got pregnant in high school with my daughter.

I know that people eat different amount to sustain their body types but sometimes they makes comments on what I eat and they like “you eat so little” “you eat like a pigeon/baby” but if I commented on their weight/eating habits i’m very much sure that they would take offense to it.

,eating_disorders,"I started gaining weight when I was 15, since then only thing that’s on my mind is to lose weight. I stopped playing sports cause my friend were smaller than me. I was insecure about my body all the time. I stopped hanging out with people as much as possible. My friends and relatives used to tell me how I look so much mature for my age. And there were guys in their late 20’s or early 30’s  hitting on me. At that time I didn’t know it was possible to lose weight cause I had never seen anyone go from being fat to skinny in real life. I started getting depressed and turned into foods for my happiness. I started binging every single day with no physical activity what so ever. I stopped studying. I went from being A grade student to failing my exams. I was gaining more and more weight without even realizing it. After 2 years, I decided to diet and workout and finally lose weight. I started waking up at 4am just to workout and I was following every diet I saw on YouTube but every diet ended up with a very bad binge. Instead of losing weight, I ended up gaining some extra. Every night I used to look at my pictures from when I was skinny and cry about how I let myself go. There wasn’t a day where suicide didn’t cross my mind. I also found out I had hypothyroidism. So then one day, one of my cousin told me how I hated the idea of eating when I was in middle school and was literally built like a twig. That made me think if I force myself to hate food again like I did in middle school and don’t eat, I’ll lose weight. So I started starving myself and the more I restricted the more I started getting obsessed with food. Then again this whole cycle of not eating for days then binging for weeks started. I struggled with this for 2 years and my weight was fluctuating so much. I was 148lbs and 122lbs in the same month. And talking about my life in general, it was miserable. I used to skip school all the time. I hated everyone but mostly myself. I had no hobbies and only talked to strangers online. And talking about my education I have no idea what did I study after middle school. My brain was never there. I used to daydream all the time and just recently found out it’s a mental illness called Maladaptive Daydreaming. Anyway, after my binge session started getting out of hand I started purging. I was bulimic for 2 months. I used to restrict as much as possible then purge when ever I did eat. I was purging every single day for 2 months from 1-6 times per day. And after that I couldn’t physically continue purging because everytime I tried to, it felt like my organs were gonna come out of my throat. My stomach was bloated all the time and my face was all swollen which made me feel more fat even tho my weight was dropping. All this time I was bulimic, I was weightlifting at the gym. Later on, I decided to eat healthy, eat more protein and lift more heavy. After 2 months I had only lost 5lbs and looked the same which drew me back to ed. No matter how much I try even the tiniest thing trigger me to go back to my unhealthy habits. I can never see myself getting smaller than this. It just feels impossible.

I started waking up at 4am just to workout and I was following every diet I saw on YouTube but every diet ended up with a very bad binge. Instead of losing weight, I ended up gaining some extra. Every night I used to look at my pictures from when I was skinny and cry about how I let myself go. There wasn’t a day where suicide didn’t cross my mind. I also found out I had hypothyroidism. So then one day, one of my cousin told me how I hated the idea of eating when I was in middle school and was literally built like a twig. That made me think if I force myself to hate food again like I did in middle school and don’t eat, I’ll lose weight. So I started starving myself and the more I restricted the more I started getting obsessed with food. Then again this whole cycle of not eating for days then binging for weeks started. I struggled with this for 2 years and my weight was fluctuating so much. I was 148lbs and 122lbs in the same month. And talking about my life in general, it was miserable. I used to skip school all the time. I hated everyone but mostly myself. I had no hobbies and only talked to strangers online. And talking about my education I have no idea what did I study after middle school. My brain was never there. I used to daydream all the time and just recently found out it’s a mental illness called Maladaptive Daydreaming. Anyway, after my binge session started getting out of hand I started purging. I was bulimic for 2 months. I used to restrict as much as possible then purge when ever I did eat. I was purging every single day for 2 months from 1-6 times per day. And after that I couldn’t physically continue purging because everytime I tried to, it felt like my organs were gonna come out of my throat. My stomach was bloated all the time and my face was all swollen which made me feel more fat even tho my weight was dropping. All this time I was bulimic, I was weightlifting at the gym. Later on, I decided to eat healthy, eat more protein and lift more heavy. After 2 months I had only lost 5lbs and looked the same which drew me back to ed. No matter how much I try even the tiniest thing trigger me to go back to my unhealthy habits. I can never see myself getting smaller than this. It just feels impossible. I’m gonna be 20 next month and I’m taking this illness with me even in my 20’s.&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Hi, I’ve recently been referred to an out patient eating disorder service at a hospital after some doctors appointments and assessments from the primary care team. I guess I’m just nervous and unsure about what to expect. I want to get better but I’m not sure I want it enough or that I’m in a good enough place mentally to be able to deal with the stress of having to keep up with appointments specifically to talk about weight and food I feel like maybe if anything that will just encourage the bad behaviours. 

I’m also nervous that they’ll weigh me I guess they kind of have to. But I’m more nervous about them saying everything is fine because I’m just on the cusp on being underweight by around 3 pounds but ‘healthy’ by bmi standards. A large part of me does want to get better but being told I’m healthy and everything’s fine will just set me back so much because it’s taken a long time to be taken seriously by the system for my mental health. I just feel like a lot of the questions they might ask I’ll likely be really indecisive and torn because as much as I’m fighting it and pushing myself to get help I do feel good when I manage to restrict to the level I want to so I guess I’m just in two minds.

If anybody has any experiences especially in the UK of talking to ED specialists and kind of how they work I’d appreciate it. Specifically how do the doctors deal with a person who is I guess on the fence about getting better. Probably not the best way to phrase it but I hope that makes sense.

i feel like part of me is ready too move on

idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best",t2_an69wvfk,False,,0,False,torn between wanting too try at life or sink deeper into ed before trying too recover,[],r/eating_disorders,False,0,,0,,False,t3_s1uk7m,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1641953793.0,text,0,,,text,self.eating_disorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i feel like part of me is ready too move on

like i think i just tried too kinda sum up why i restrict

for instance i kinda knew the answer but i wanted too see what google results came up with when i typed in
""whats it called when you dont want too eat because
youll feel too much"" and ofc AN came up as a top result.

and ik that eds are complex mental illnesses but when we invalidate ourselves over little things i feel like this gives me perspective because sometimes i feel like having an ed can come down too a 'simple?' thing. like not wanting too eat because you wont be able too numb ur emotions. idk if this is making sense. using that example like what other reason could that result in besides from an ed. thats surely not a normal thinking pattern or that of a dieter. is this making sense?

,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone, I've come here to try and get some advice on how to deal with my roommate. 

As someone who's been dealing with eating disorders my entire adolescence, I can spot the signs a mile away, and my roommate is very, very obviously struggling with an ED. She weighs her food, notes it all down in myfitnesspal, uses her treadmill 24/7, and talks about her body (feeling bloated, fat, etc) constantly. I've tried to talk about it with her a few times now and each time she just flatly denies that there's any sort of issue at all, and obviously with EDs it's not something I want to push because I know exactly how stressful that can be. 

The trouble is that it's been so long since I was in the stage of my ED where I was in denial that I just can't remember how I would want someone to bring this up with me. That, and the fact that all of this has been immensely triggering to me. Like seriously triggering. Before moving in here I'd gotten to the point where it wasn't something I was thinking about every day, but now I no longer have that luxury. I'm starting to worry that I might have to move out, which is obviously super annoying and sad. 

I've managed to persuade her to go to therapy, but the only thing she's told the therapist she needs help with is anxiety. Should I tell her I think she needs to tell her therapist about the ED? I think that's the most important part of this - getting her to confront her issues with someone who knows what they're talking about. Orrrrr, I could email her new therapist directly and tell her all the stuff I know my roommate won't bring up but needs to be addressed.

I have had self esteem issues most of my life but i turned all the focus to my body when i was about 18 after being in a bit of a turbulent relationship where id get a lot of weight and body related comments. This is where it turned into full blown body dysmorphia and i began restricting my diet. I have tried a couple fad diets and workout routines but nothing every really stuck but i kept eating smaller portions and now i struggle to exercise due to dizziness/light headedness and weakness. Im about 5""3 and at my heaviest i was probably 67kg and a size 12 last i checked i am now 53.5kg and i am very happy with the loss but still feel huge, partly because i bloat after i eat or drink anything but also because i don't feel like ive made much ""progress"" i guess? I dont think ive lost much weight and i thought i was eating a pretty normal amount of food. I think on a day where im going out or exercising(bike) ill eat maybe 4000- 5000kj and if im just sitting at home or not moving around much maybe 3000-4000kj but then i have days where ill just eat a muesli bar and soup or something for dinner because im not that hungry. I do feel guilty if i overeat and i tend to make up for that by not eating a lot the next day and/or going off the food i ate too much of for a few months. I dont feel hungry much these days and struggle to finish a meal in one sitting because i feel painfully fully after a few mouthfuls. When i do feel hungry its normally when im starving and i need to eat ""RIGHT NOW"" otherwise i get really dizzy and shaky and have palpitations. I guess the reason im asking this is because ive been having quite bad health issues the past 5 years that seem to be getting progressively worse, it never occurred to me that it could be diet related. Ive had many tests done and seen a few different doctors. Im pretty much always fatigued and before i started taking vyvanse for adhd i would just fall asleep everywhere, brain fog that gets so bad i can't remember the words for some things and i cant read and retain information or focus on a task, dizziness when moving around (mostly when bending over and standing up), exercise intolerance (shortness of breath,heart palpitations, dizziness, nausea, cant catch my breath), digestive problems, weird cough thing when i get heart palpitations, heat/cold intolerance, mineral/vitamin deficiencies, low ferritin, eyesight has been getting worse the past few years and seem to keep needing a stronger perscription, random aches and pains and numbness/tingling/burning areas that move around my body, panic attacks have started happening quite recently and now trouble with short term memory in the past few months but idk if that's just stress. Sorry if this is a lot im just not sure who to talk to or if i even should, i just dont feel like im underweight or anything like that.

I do feel guilty if i overeat and i tend to make up for that by not eating a lot the next day and/or going off the food i ate too much of for a few months. I dont feel hungry much these days and struggle to finish a meal in one sitting because i feel painfully fully after a few mouthfuls. When i do feel hungry its normally when im starving and i need to eat &amp;quot;RIGHT NOW&amp;quot; otherwise i get really dizzy and shaky and have palpitations. I guess the reason im asking this is because ive been having quite bad health issues the past 5 years that seem to be getting progressively worse, it never occurred to me that it could be diet related. Ive had many tests done and seen a few different doctors. Im pretty much always fatigued and before i started taking vyvanse for adhd i would just fall asleep everywhere, brain fog that gets so bad i can&amp;#39;t remember the words for some things and i cant read and retain information or focus on a task, dizziness when moving around (mostly when bending over and standing up), exercise intolerance (shortness of breath,heart palpitations, dizziness, nausea, cant catch my breath), digestive problems, weird cough thing when i get heart palpitations, heat/cold intolerance, mineral/vitamin deficiencies, low ferritin, eyesight has been getting worse the past few years and seem to keep needing a stronger perscription, random aches and pains and numbness/tingling/burning areas that move around my body, panic attacks have started happening quite recently and now trouble with short term memory in the past few months but idk if that&amp;#39;s just stress. Sorry if this is a lot im just not sure who to talk to or if i even should, i just dont feel like im underweight or anything like that. I feel guilty for feeling like i might have an issue when im not really skinny or super sick or anything but im not sure if thats just negative self talk. If you made it this far thank you so much for reading everyone and have a great day! ❤&lt;/p&gt;

,eating_disorders,"Is it bad that my wife and I haven’t had sex yet even though we’ve been married since June 2021? 

There’s a lot that goes into this. We’re both virgins. I’ve had 4 relationships and a few sexual experiences that never led to sex due to my Christian beliefs. But I know how I get turned on, how to please myself and the way that I’ve coped with not having sex up until now was through masturbation whenever I get too horny from sleeping next to her and cuddling her every night.

For her, I’m her first boyfriend and now husband and she’s never had experience pleasuring herself before marrying me and doesn’t know a lot about how to turn herself on or allow someone to turn her on.

On top of this, we’re both black, but her mom raised her to only like people that aren’t black. Also, she’s a gym rat and is kind of OCD and is a control freak over food and compulsive exercise. She grew up really really insecure about her body due to some childhood trauma caused by her mother who has eating disorder tendencies and borderline personality disorder issues that she then passed on to my wife (mainly the eating disorder tendencies including a love/hate relationship with food, her body, and exercise).

She also doesn’t feel comfortable being touched near her vaginal area and tenses up whenever my hand gets close. We’ve tried letting her lead my hand, but the problem is we’re both busy a lot and when we get downtime and can cuddle and kiss, she usually doesn’t want to kiss, and likes to be on a specific schedule where she might decide to get on her computer and learn coding techniques after we eat and watch a movie/show and will sit on her computer while watching at times. If I ask to cuddle or show affection, she might sigh and say she’s not into it and just prefers to laugh at the movie with me or find new shows together. Which I also enjoy. 

She goes to bed early and wakes up super early to go to the gym. So the night routine would be about making sure she eats light and does whatever she needs to do so she can have energy to wake up at 4-5 am and go workout for 2 hours before coming back to see me off as I go to work. And sometimes that means not making out since that might cause her to have to stay up a little longer and end up falling asleep with me instead of staying on top of things so she can get up earlier. This process repeats daily except on Saturdays when I’m off and sometimes we don’t end up getting to kiss then either. So I tend not to ask to kiss much anymore and just cuddle her while we sleep at night since this is the only time we can actually cuddle.

She also had a hard time allowing me to compliment her and call her beautiful, pretty, sexy, or any flirtatious words, because she really doesn’t think so and is not used to being comfortable with her body as it is and is always trying to manipulate it and change it.

I usually don’t mind her habits, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t find her habits to be sometimes really annoying because it feels a lot like there’s another person in the relationship (her body and routine). It feels like it’s so important to her that she’s willing to focus really hard on it and not so much on building intimacy with me.

The last factor is that we got married super fast after dating for a year, no ceremony or nothing. And it felt rushed because we didn’t take our time with the engagement and felt pressured by our premarital counselor that was faith based instead of clinical based. So ever since then, that’s been a factor as well. 

These things combined have put strains in our communication and ability to have emotional intimacy because half the time I’m trying not to be viewed as an enemy for asking her honest questions about some of her habits in a nice way and encouraging her to go to therapy.

We’re getting better and have been in marriage counseling from a well practiced, empathetic therapist, but the lack of sex has been a concern for us. 

As for her habits, I’ve begun to not say much about it and just let the counselor lead conversations about that when needed and sometimes we get to discuss it by ourselves as a couple. 

And we recently talked about how we can start approaching sex again.

I just want to be alone and unbothered so I can eat and eat. When my spending started getting really bad, a bit before my card was taken from me, I could no longer pay my half of the rent. Because guess what? I spent it all on binge food. Which made my boyfriend be forced to work more to pay for the house. That in turn also made me excited, because YAY, EVEN MORE TIME ALONE TO JUST EAT ALONE!\nAnyways, in the last 2 months of not having a debit card, I started going nuts over ways to get ahold of my precious drug of choice. So I started stealing food from wherever I can. And I started stealing money from family. And if I can\'t get ahold of either, I just go to my mom\'s house while she is at work, and eat damn near her whole kitchen. Then I text her to give her a ""heads up"" that I raided her kitchen and left a wreck and ate all her food. She goes shopping to get more so she can actually eat, and I come over again to eat it all myself....and see if I can find her wallet. Rinse and repeat. At one point, we\'ve tried locks and whatnot on cabinets and such. Didn\'t work. I break them. I\'ve also become pretty good at getting locks open in general now.\nIt\'s a disgusting shame, and I just wanna fucking kill myself sometimes for letting it get this way. I\'m no different than my heroin addicted sister who died of an OD. She did the same thing.....stealing, lying, sneaky tactics. \nI have a multitude of health issues that will kill me if I don\'t stop this. Yet I still cant. \nEven as I type this out, I am finishing up a GALLON of ice cream that I took from my mom\'s freezer about an hour and a half ago. I just texted her that I took it, If she wants to replace it. But of course, I\'m just gonna take that one too when she buys it and eat it all in one sitting. \nI feel like the worst human being ever. Especially since I used to be so responsible, decently intelligent, and just overall a well rounded person.

,eating_disorders,"So a little bit of quick background, I (18F) have been struggling food-related/disordered eating/body image wise for a long time. I grew up a competitive dancer, hence the beginning of all of this. 

I decided to take a big step and schedule an appointment to my doctors office to talk about it and hopefully get a diagnosis. I restrict and purge, but do not binge. And I think i’m ready to start my recovery process. 

My 2 questions are
1) Does anyone know what eating disorder that could possibly be? Again, I only restrict and purge, but technically i’m not underweight. 

2) Does every ED recovery involve a meal plan? I’m very afraid of meal plans :/ If not, what else would happen during recovery. 

Thank you in advance!

,eating_disorders,When I was 7 almost 8 my mom moved into the same house as my father which turned into two years of hell that ended when I was almost 10. The abuse between both my parents was a lot to handle at such a young age and I had my brother to take care of since our parents were always to busy with each other to hang out with us. During this time I became depressed which lead me not eating. I would wait until my stomach hurt to eat and then only eat until the pain went away which didn’t make me full and over this period the stomach pain took longer to kick in so I went longer without eating. I didn’t stop eating because of weight in fact I didn’t care about my weight I didn’t mind how big or small I was it had everything to do with guilt. I felt as though I didn’t deserve to be happy with the situation I was in and eating makes you happy. After we left that situation my dad became poor and didn’t feed us a lot but my mom always went shopping when we were at his house and by this point I managed to start eating again and stay healthy but my dad not feeding us lead me to binge eat when we got back to my moms house because we were so hungry and eating all of the food made me happy. I remember making baked goods for my family and eating all of it myself and they couldn’t have any. Over the next couple of years I bounced back and forth between over eating and under eating. It wasn’t until I started counseling that I realized my problem and at the time I was 30 pound underweight. I realized I had a lot of trauma and that none of it was my fault so I began loving myself and now I’m 12 pounds underweight and getting better everyday I hope this post can inspire others to get better because it is possible it can an most likely will be a long battle but it’s worth it and it is possible you just have to want it,t2_8d1nw15u,False,,0,False,My story,[],r/eating_disorders,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ruxcs4,False,dark,0.82,,public,7,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1641200355.0,text,0,,,text,self.eating_disorders,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 7 almost 8 my mom moved into the same house as my father which turned into two years of hell that ended when I was almost 10.

,eating_disorders,"(24M) 
I’m a senior in college and over the past year or so my relationship with food has become more and more complicated. 
As a teen, I struggled a lot with being underweight. It lead to a lot of insecurity and body image issues and cause me to turn to binge eating as an attempt to see myself as more normal or happier with my body. As I got older, I outgrew it. 

However, it has come back in different ways. I now have new cravings to binge eat. Especially fast food, junk food, and sugar. I crave stuffing my face. When eat junk food, I get a buzz. Similar to alcohol or nicotine. It’s like a high. It has caused me to gain about 30 lbs. Since I have always been underweight, this only puts me at a normal/healthy weight. 

What I thought I wanted so badly (to have a “normal” body) has brought up other issues. I now daily constantly trying to suck in my stomach. I feel my stomach fat and my stretch marks on my legs and get an overwhelming feeling that just churns my core. One second I feel horrible guilt, and the next I feel some sort of satisfaction or reward for binge eating. Then it turns right back into guilt. I like the idea that I’ve been able to gain weight because it was so hard to for a long time. But now I feel like I have to hide my weight gain from the people around me.  I just feel like I’m at a dead end, like I can’t escape it. It’s a constant n my mind.

Similar to alcohol or nicotine. It’s like a high. It has caused me to gain about 30 lbs. Since I have always been underweight, this only puts me at a normal/healthy weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I thought I wanted so badly (to have a “normal” body) has brought up other issues. I now daily constantly trying to suck in my stomach. I feel my stomach fat and my stretch marks on my legs and get an overwhelming feeling that just churns my core. One second I feel horrible guilt, and the next I feel some sort of satisfaction or reward for binge eating. Then it turns right back into guilt. I like the idea that I’ve been able to gain weight because it was so hard to for a long time. But now I feel like I have to hide my weight gain from the people around me.  I just feel like I’m at a dead end, like I can’t escape it. It’s a constant n my mind. I just want to go one day without having a crisis about my body.&lt;/p&gt;

christmas was crap lol got abit worse &amp; urge too restrict was massive. ive not been alone at all for about a week now &amp; staying at my friends and i feel so overwhelmed. staying at my friends has allowed me too restrict alot for the first time in 3 weeks or a month maybe and i feel like its just chucked me back into the deep end. i ate some toast this morning and havent felt that uncomfortable about eating food in ages. like 2 weeks ago that probs would have been ok but now its too stressful and since im not home and cant weigh food etc im using more behaviours too compensate. 

halve way thru eating i realised there was some mould on the bread, and my first thought was at least this could get me sick and i could loose weight. mate what. its crazy how easy these thoughts can slip back in after even accidentally restricting or when you don't even realise you've been slipping back. not sure where i stand with my ed at all anymore or if i have one rn. i guess it never rly goes away, i just want help so i can feel validated but dont actually want too get better :(

I’ve had an eating disorder since high school, and fought with it for many many years (28f). It’s been a big goal of mine to talk with a nutritionist about losing weight in a healthier manner. Someone to hold me accountable while slowly losing weight. I used to teeter between not eating for days and obsessing over every calorie. I was put on a waiting list for a well renowned nutritionist clinic back in June, and had my initial appointment in November. I told the nutritionist what my goal was: losing weight steadily over time, until I got to the weight my body worked best at, which is 60 lbs lighter than I am now. I want to be held accountable and have milestones so that I don’t regress into my bad eating habits. Not looking for a date in mind to get back to that weight, just whatever works best for me.

,eating_disorders,"So, throughout my childhood I was able to maintain a healthy weight, but after a while I began to receive comments from a family member stating that I was getting fat and needed to lose weight, despite my doctors saying that I was the proper size for my age and that going a few pounds over was fine, as long as I keep it in control. 

Anyway, I tried letting it go and eventually I did. I was a pretty happy kid for the most part and almost always ate 3 meals a day and never skipped until I reached age 11 or 12. Around that time I became more self-conscious about how I looked, but l'm not exactly sure why...I really don't understand what caused it all, but one day I just got in my head and thought that I shouldn't eat anymore because I thought people would judge me for it. Like when l'd go to school, I'd just force myself to think that people were making fun of me for eating and so I stopped eating like I normally would to make all those thoughts go away. I just really dreaded eating in front of people. 

Instead of eating healthy meals, I would only eat potato chips or soda ONLY throughout the entire day and I did this for months until I noticed that my clothes were getting looser. Then I weighed myself one day and noticed that I had lost a significant amount of weight, but it didn't bother me. I actually like the fact that I was losing weight because it made my legs and waist look smaller and it became so bad to the point where my ribs began to show. 

Eventually, my significant weight loss began taking a toll on my health and I started feeling more dizzy, developed diaestive problems, had shortness of breath, and started to feel more weak whenever I tried doing normal activities.  I thought |  was fine though because I went to the doctor about it multiple times and they always told me that nothing was wrong with me, but it definitely feels like there's a problem because I've never had these problems before this started. 

 So here we are today…Over the years I have tried to fix my eating habits, but I don't think I'm doing very well with that.  I was so used to ignoring myself when I got hungry that now I forget to eat sometimes.  Like l'll eat maybe once or twice a day now but l'm not like how I used to be because usually l'll just eat one large meal and just skip for the rest of the day or just eat small portions of food just to say I've ate something.  It's really frustrating too because people just don't seem to understand that I'm trying and only see it as me being a difficult person, but the way I feel is more complex than they think.  

Anyway, I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder nor do I know if my situation qualifies as something of the sort, but if someone could offer me suggestions or advice on how I can fix myself, please do so.

,eating_disorders,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit so I am unsure if this is the correct thread for this time of concern. I apologize if that’s the case!

I struggled with an eating disorder throughout my sophomore and junior year of high school. I restricted heavily and exercised in order to lose weight. I lost a ton of weight and suffered physical affects from the drastic measures I took. 

I am a junior in college now, and have since recovered, and back at a normal weight. I feel as if I have a healthy relationship with food and exercise. 

However, what concerns me, is that recently I have randomly been feeling shameful about my body and self-image. It’s hard to describe- like a cold feeling in my stomach that will randomly pop up and make me feel really bad and insecure about myself. It’s very odd because I don’t usually feel that way about myself. It will just pop up randomly and it makes me want to engage in eating disorder behaviors again. 

I am just curious if anyone else experiences this and how they go about these feelings?

If i wasn’t already super skinny, i would not be worrying about this so much, however i am now 5’10 and weigh 109 and feel i look sick. I do not want to look like this. I just want to wear tight pants without people making comment’s that i look sick. I will go on spirts occasionally forcing myself to eat meals on routine but always lose it because i never gain anything. So frustrating. I know one day I’ll probably look back at this issue right now and wish my biggest problem was gaining weight but in the current moment it is so frustrating and I do not know what to do with myself. Any ideas on how to gain weight quick and easy -without actually eating a lot. Or advice in general for my situation ?thanks guys.&lt;/p&gt;

Idk, at this point I have to admit my bulimia is starting to be kinda prominent again. I am purging like ten times a week, lost over twenty pounds in two months (although I am still on the higher end of normal BMI), and despite the fact I am used to this considering its been going on for over ten years, even I am becoming worried. 

I am looking over all my resources again. I do have an option to go to daily treatment center or to get hospitalized, both for free, I'll get medical leave from work, my bf is okay with it, the only downside is the waiting list which I would be on for like two months. 

It's just...I've been there two times already (to both the daily treament and hospitalization) and while it helped for several months, I always relapsed. 

It feels kinda pointless to put my life on hold again for something that failed twice already. I know third time's is a charm, but, like...i feel discouraged and I'd rather just let this go on and see where it takes me. Sounds morbid.

Another thing is that I am ashamed to be going for the third time already with no visible progress. It's like spitting into doctor's faces.

been going through a peroid of eating kinda normally and not using as many behaviours for about 3 weeks- a month. makes me feel v uncomfortable and unsafe but im trying too be kind too myself. its not recovery i dont think and ik im just waiting and begging too want too hardcore restrict again. idk what this uncomfortable middle ground is i hate it here.

 i am meeting my best friends who i havent seen in months tonight and part of me rllllly wants too restrict until then but i also want too eat and fuel properly so im not anxious and moody lol. i think mayb its cause theyre the only ppl who know ab my struggles and i feel pressure too *look* the part. stupid ik. but part of me feels guilty for confiding in them w my struggles and then not struggling as much for abit. 

 im just struggling with the motivation and feeling allowed too eat.  no one in my family knows about my ed and i feel so alone too either keep myself accountable or go thru this alone. i just need some support too make the *actual* right decision bcos im so torn.  my brains just split into 2 man i hate this shit.

,eating_disorders,"1. so this has happened twice to me and i don’t know if it’s normal or i should be concerned or??? 

both times i started my day with iced coffee from dunkin’ because it makes me feel full for a while for whatever reason. i restricted for a while, maybe having a couple snacks in between then ate dinner. i ate until i was full at dinner but then like an hour later my stomach started feeling weird? it just kept making noise and then i started to feel hunger pains. i have really bad anxiety and ofc thought i was dying or something lmao but i know that wasn’t it. but it kept me up for at least 3 hours the first time and 2 the second. 

i know stomach acid has an effect on an empty stomach and you shouldn’t drink coffee first thing. did that have something to do with the pain? like how long does affects from stomach acid last? or was it just from restricting so long? 

2. i don’t usually eat breakfast but recently by like 9:00am with no food i get super dizzy. any suggestions on how to prevent this? you’re probably like just eat but like is there anything else i can do because it’s happening in class😭

3. i think (?) this is a side effect from restricting but what’s up with the nausea? is it normal to feel super nauseas when you haven’t eaten or after eating? and any suggestions on how to help it? that is like the worst feeling for me

,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone so I’ve struggled with my weight and body image for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I was insecure about my curves and when I tried to lose weight I would gain more. Eventually the slim thick trend came and so I was able to accept myself and embrace my body. However, after barely a year of my new found confidence I experienced a huge weight loss. I lost 20lbs w/o trying and I didn’t know what to do. My health suffered and my confidence plummeted as a result. It was embarrassing cause everyone noticed and pointed it out i was the skinniest I’d ever been(113lbs and I’m 5’7 for context) In 2021 I finally was back at my ideal weight (134lbs) after nearly 3 years of fluctuations. I felt good happy and healthy only for my weight to dip back down after my 21st birthday.I was stressed out around tht time and had trouble eating but I managed to keep my weight at 125 only for it to dip to 120 and now I’m teetering between 117 and 120.

 May - July fell into a binge restrict cycle whilst experiencing extreme hunger due too heavy restriction for about 5 months. 

then Aug - Dec fell again into a mix of v low restriction, b/p, over exercise all, eating maintenence. all of it id experienced Until December.

But now for the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is fail restriction &amp; basically binge, only purg!ng a little, a few times. 

ive probs been eating around maintenance, but still mainly vegan- ignoring timings and not rly measuring any food or cal counting which i feel so guilty for loosing even more control.  

my body is disgusting, im more depressed than ive ever been but i dont think thats soley from my ED; although the depression is fuelling it. 

 ive been ignoring my body and how it looks, not weighing or stressing over it only stressing over the loss of control and 'discipline' and my ed 'disappearing'.
 
now i feel like all im doing is eating &amp; have little desire too restrict - waiting until its all too much &amp; i can see again how quickly i can loose it all and get back too my lw. 

so uncomfortable with everything neither option seems appealing i keep telling myself if i reach below my lw by 31 jan (my bday) i can get help.

 i feel like i need too just get bored of eating and b repulsed by it until i can hardcore restrict again. i don't want to recover but i'm holding hope that by mid next year i will have gotten much much worse so maybe i can start then. ik u shouldn't wait till that point but i cant imagine rn wanting too let go of this life ever.

,eating_disorders,"I know I can't ask for medical advice but I'm just curious if anyone else experienced this? 

For context, for the past couple weeks? months, maybe? I've been purging anything I eat, &amp; other times I try to restrict as much as possible. I've dropped a significant amount of weight recently (just as early as this past July/August I was still in the 160s, whereas as of today I've hit 140.3lbs), &amp; much more recently I've been far more restrictive. 

Maybe 3 days ago I remember eating extremely little (probably &lt;200 cal.), &amp; I don't remember if I purged. But the next day or so I didn't eat at all. Then yesterday I ate some of an apple (shared with my pets that can eat it), I had a cup of yogurt, some Goldfish crackers &amp; 2 small waffles leftover on the counter from breakfast that day. I 'binged' that all (my 'binges' are usually 'normal' portions/calorie counts for meals &amp; hardly surpass even healthy amounts of calories, but I always eat it all at once) in one sitting &amp; immediately purged it. 

Usually I let myself by with probably a net of 200-300 calories a day, even if I purge I know I can't get it all, but it's still very restrictive. 

Anyway, I think not eating a single thing &amp; purging the only thing I did eat after 2 days just took it out of me, because when I woke up today I felt like death. I woke up with a dull sharp pain in my stomach, &amp; by the time I got up to use the bathroom it was shooting through my whole body, especially in my lower abdomen, almost mimicking period cramps. 

As I write this the pain seems to have subsided for the most part, but it's so consistent &amp; painful. Today, I'm not going to be purging; I know one more day - hell, a lot of more days - of this starving isn't going to kill me, but I can't be starving myself that badly. So far, today, I ate about half an apple, a peanut granola bar, &amp; a glass of water. 

The thing that drove me to write this post though was because of how persistent the pains were? I started with the apple to help &amp; admittedly ate it very slowly, but probably by the time I had 5 pieces of it (about 1/4) I felt essentially no change in the pains &amp; I gave in &amp; ate the granola bar (reluctantly, because why is a single tiny granola bar 170 calories?). 

I sipped the water in between bites of everything &amp; I'm hoping that helps me feel more full. I just still feel hungry but in a way that I don't want to eat. I could barely stomach eating the food I had today, but I'm worried that I've gone from my old habits of binging all day earlier this year, to now I'm forcing myself to eat something, anything, because I just feel that shitty. 

Do others experience this really bad pain too after restricting like that? Because I've had bad hunger pains that make me wanna throw up, but those go away pretty fast after a bite or two. These pains feel like they shoot through my whole abdomen &amp; make me feel sick &amp; weak. Just curious if this is common with heavy restriction, because I've never felt them this bad before

is it normal too go thru phases in ur ed where you just dont care anymore / have lost the reason too restrict or engage in ed behaviours and r just kinda ""normal"" for a few weeks


i feel like i *feel* so much more when im restricting or purging etc even if its mainly shitty feelings and thoughts.  but the past 2 weeks or so all ive done is basically binge eat or eat normally with no compensatory behaviours. 


i just feel so numb &amp; my life so bland that i dont rly care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day.its not like this doesnt make me hella uncomfortable. i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness &amp; worry my ed is slipping away. not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally.


i cycle alot thru different phases like p/b, pure restriction, over excersize, lax abuse etc. 
but rn im not rly doing any of that for the past two weeks and im scared my ed has gone or smth. 
ik its not rly true- the thoughts r there, theres still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use. 
i feel disgusting &amp; am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel Nothing rn &amp; its causing me too not care enough about if im gaining etc.  


is this just part of a cycle do other ppl w eds kinda sometimes go too a point of remission?? idk what too call it.

im 18, not in recovery and no one rly knows ab my ed besides from best friend who doesn't go my school. 

decided last night too try and eat more structured; but an amount im more comfortable with because ive got alot of work too do in school and have been feeling abit happier so its easier too eat. 

ive been following an almost completely vegan diet for a few months but probs not for the right reasons.  today one of my friends offered me a cookie she baked (not vg) and i made an excuse at first to not eat it but later at lunch she was persistsnt she wanted me too try one and i felt bad so said yes. 

tried abit, hid rest in bag. 
changed mind &amp; ended up bloody eating it without trying too think too much. 

but now im just kinda panicking &amp; feel uncomfortable because it wasnt in my plan &amp; i dont know whats in it or the cals or anything i feel like i can feel the fat seeping into my stomach. 
like i just wish i hadnt ate it. 

it tasted good and its nice too not miss out again but its just so uncomfortable and i feel guilty about it my stomach feels warm and uncomfortable af. 

ik if this would have happened a few weeks ago when i was deeper in my ed and restricting more i would have been mortified but since ive sort of started feeling and eating abit differently (not recovery but idk) im not *tooo* stressed over it.

for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours &amp; thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot/ or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged- but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. 

it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. ( the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much/ dont have the energy or just dont *care* enough tbh. ) 
 
The normal eating with little guilt (not because it was safe foods or id compensated- just genuinley alright w eating it ) only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. 

its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction,  trying too make it worse than last time. 
but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat/ feel normal for good- but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. 

its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it.

I spent three days a week exercising while drinking 2 to 3 Ensure’s each day/every other day along with vitamins and trying to eat as much as I could.

im pretty sure it was below maintenance but since i couldnt purge all of it the 'typical' way; ive started working out more again, sp for the last hour or so i was working out, and the second i start too actually enjoy it and not only do it too feel ok after what i ate and less anxious. like i was kinda doing it cause it felt fun- i start feeling guilty becaude this should be for punishment &amp; compensation- not for me too enjoy. so that sucks. now theres literally nothing i can do. ive been feeling guilty for sitting recently and found myself trying too always be moving. 

i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time (like they're beneficial too my ed) so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that.

,eating_disorders,"Hello,

**TL;DR;** Binge eating (and other eating disorders) is sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine disorder and not JUST a psychiatric one and restoring metabolic health can help tremendously with recovery

A friend of mine suffered from extreme BED since she was 13. This, among other things, caused her to be morbidly obese and she also developed PCOS.

She was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward twice (self-admitted). Despite all the therapy and meds, she was never able to control the disorder, because she just could not fight against the urges to binge.

I myself am a final year medical student (Central Europe). After talking to her, she told me that she gets these intense cravings randomly throughout the day. I thought, well, maybe we can tackle this from the metabolic side (in addition to her going to therapy).

So I suggested she should talk to her physician in order to get a prescription for metformin (insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic medication) and an SGLT2-inhibitor (causes around 100g of carbohydrates to be lost via the urine every day). The metformin ER (2g/day) + the empagliflozin (12.5mg/d) helped with the metabolic dysregulation by counteracting the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is also one of the main factors that causes overweight individuals to be very hungry, because the stored adipose tissue (fat) cannot be tapped into, because the high levels of insulin inhibit lipolysis (fat breakdown). This causes people to become very hungry quite soon after eating.

Furthermore, I cleaned up her diet. We settled on a paleo-like diet with slow-release carbs with low glycemic index (e.g. beans, peas, sweet potatoe, other veggies), plenty of good fats (olive oil, butter, avocado), and protein. We removed fast-spiking carbs (e.g. bread, pasta, potatoes, etc.) and milk products (as whey and casein -the milk proteins- have some endocrine activity and can lead to inflammation and cravings due to their synergizing effects on insulin as well as IGF1 -a hepatic growth factor).

Well, low and behold, after 2 weeks of ups and downs, she did not have one single binge in over 5 months. Her weight loss is in the image. Currently, she sits at 75kg and is still losing and binge free. (The story as well as the screenshot below is of course posted with her permission).

The therapy (targeting the psychological side of things) was ineffective until also the metabolic/endocrine side of things was addressed -after which both components worked synergistically.

While binging often has a large psychological component (addiction, stress-eating), there is also an endocrine/metabolic/internistic component (e.g. intense craving due to metabolic dysregulation) -which is often neglected by many doctors.

I just want to share her journey as well as encourage some of you to talk to your physician to tackle the metabolic side of things, because, if the *physiological* craving is eliminated, controlling binges is a lot easier.

**Moral of the story:** BED has sometimes ALSO a metabolic/endocrine component and not JUST a psychiatric one. And this metabolic/endocrine component (i.e. *one* of multiple factors) could either be a contributing cause or a disorder-maintaining consequence of BED. Nonetheless, whether cause or consequence, it can be targeted with specific medical interventions, which should/could help tremendously with recovery (esp. in subjects whose eating is triggered by hunger pangs and not purely due to stress/coping, etc.)

Bonus: Instead of the empagliflozin, even more effective would be a GLP1-agonist (e.g. liraglutide), which is both an insulin sensitizer, slows stomach emptying (--&gt; less hunger pangs), as well as activates POMC-neurons in the hypothalamus (--&gt; greater and prolonged satiety and greater energy levels). In the near future, she will likely switch out the empagliflozin for the liraglutide. An excerpt of a study regarding the use of GLP1-agonists in BED is shown below.

restricted this week successfully after not rly doing it 'good' for a few weeks &amp; gained weight too a number i was uncomfortable with. 
diddnt weigh for a few days whilst restricting bc i had not enough time in schedule too weigh how i need too like before hand so wasnt sure how much/ if i lost/ gained. 
but felt like i was eating unsafe/ too much during those days even though i was tracking &amp; was restricting. was halve sure i gained and halve sure i lost. but just begging too just b under what i considered uncomfortable / dangerous weight. 

so today when i could finally i did and was relieved &amp; elated too see i lost way more than i thought i did. - too a num ive not been in a month or so. 
then i seem too always fall back into a pattern of when i loose weight part of me thinks its ok too eat so i fucking did &amp; i ate mainly chocolate and crap. 

restricted in a sense but stopped tracking cals after abit but im sure it was around my maintenance ?  

spent the rest of the day every time after eating resetting my fucking fasting timer &amp; then after the initial freak out &amp; guilt of what i just ate went away id eat again and reset again. 

cried basically the whole afternoon and night lol and tried too excersize abit but just too tired too !! (so now i feel like a fake and guilty coz i cant even compensate good enough ha) &amp; used unhealthy coping mechanisms after but now im just lying here 10pm tears sticking too my face feeling like such a faliure sad little piece of crap ha bcos not only did i unsuccessfully purge, excersize &amp;  restrict. 

im paranoid &amp; sad af that tomorrow when i weigh i will have gained and that number will be further away again &amp; ill be forever stuck in a cycle of reaching a gw, giving in &amp; eating, loosing control &amp; gaining &amp; then spendjng weeks just trying to get back control &amp; too a manageable comfortable weight. 

i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. 
 like all these cals will turn too fat since i'm just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. 

i feel too guilty too sleep but i'm tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop. 

so nlw im just lying here dreading the weight gain of tomorrow and having too look in the mirror back too square one. 

is this even a normal ed thought pattern. is  anything even wrong. this is fkn horrible. will i gain? is it possible since it was cal dense and right before sleep. my heads going to explode and i just want to bloody sleep.

&lt;p&gt;i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. 
 like all these cals will turn too fat since i&amp;#39;m just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel too guilty too sleep but i&amp;#39;m tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so nlw im just lying here dreading the weight gain of tomorrow and having too look in the mirror back too square one. &lt;/p&gt;

it sounds bad but it was 'my thing' yk. 

since starting uni in sept things have been getting worse, &amp; they are much much worse than how i was when i left my old friends in school in june.

now im in uni and made new friends, none of them rly know and ive not directly made any suggestions towards having an ed. but if you knew i struggled w it and observed me my behaviours r clearly disordered lol.  
 
anways yday me and 2 of my friends were talking about r certain topics and sharing some things related, and one of them briefly mentioned they once dealt with an ed &amp; body dysmorphia, nothing more than that, literally just saying those words. 
and oh my god has it sent me running back into restriction. 

and then all these shitty thoughts towards them starts. tbh i wouldnt have guessed or thought they had struggled, theyve never displayed any thing concerning and believe me, i have been observing the shit out of my friends at lunch and the way they talk ab food ha. for no reason i think its just an ed thing we do w most ppl. so i would have never guessed bcoz they seem too have a great relationship w food etc. 
So in my brain the way they said it made it seem like they had had an issue with food/ or body image but were just labelling it as an ed.  

i feel so guilty like im trying to invalidate them cause they seem fine and like if they had rly dealt w an ed they wouldnt have said it like that. 
but ofc i dont rly want to invalidate anyone coz ik that eds are so mental. but its just really really got too me.

i think what i rly am upset by is that i just feel like they threw the word around, and that she just brushed over it like they were a simple struggle and now theyre just absolutely fine and recovered. 
when i know how fucking torturous they are &amp; feel so misunderstood in this illness.
 i never feel like i can talk about it w ANY of my friends unless i know exactly what too say and what topics im going too cover because i just want them too understand!! and too paint the right picture. i feel so protective over it and now so so competitive like i have too prove w out saying anything that i've 'actually struggled' w an ed. 

even though the person is lovely &amp; would never try too upset me or feel competitive w this, i feel such a need too prove myself and restrict better bcos i 'actually struggle' but also am trying too look as normal as possible. i said nothing after so they dont know but idk i just feel so bad for invalidating them sm just about appearance and from what ive seen them do.

Hello everyone,

A friend and I have been making a short documentary about orthorexia. We really really want to pay attention to the topic and finish this documentary, but unfortunately we don’t receive any financial support. That's why we have set- up a crowdfunding! You can help us by donating via the link below. There are nice thank yous and gifts linked to the donations and every little bit helps!

We are from the Netherlands, but the video has subtitles, so you can see what it's all about.

You can donate via this link: [https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/13016-ziek-gezond-1](https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/13016-ziek-gezond-1)

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend and I have been making a short documentary about orthorexia. We really really want to pay attention to the topic and finish this documentary, but unfortunately we don’t receive any financial support. That&amp;#39;s why we have set- up a crowdfunding! You can help us by donating via the link below. There are nice thank yous and gifts linked to the donations and every little bit helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are from the Netherlands, but the video has subtitles, so you can see what it&amp;#39;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can donate via this link: &lt;a href=""https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/13016-ziek-gezond-1""&gt;https://www.voordekunst.nl/projecten/13016-ziek-gezond-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
