"we've updated rule 1 and me reminiscing . hi everyone we actually updated it about a week or two ago, but i forgot to make an announcement sharing the update. as some of you may recall, we made a post a bit ago with a poll asking you guys if you thought we should add the prohibition of specific fasting times to rule ten. for a reminder, rule ten is the rule in which numbers unrelated to time are prohibited; the numbers related to weights, calories, etc. this is the post i'm referring to. https: www.reddit.com r anorexianervosa comments siermg as an addition to rule 1 disallow fasting time ?utm source share amp;utm medium web2x amp;context 3 the poll passed, and results came in, and they said that we should add that fasting times be no longer allowed. so here we are with that added to the rules for everyone to see, as a note to rule ten. amp; x2 b; with the mod stuff out of the way... guys, i was going through my old posts, and i've been a mod here for three damn years. and when i first got added by the admins the original sub creator was hella inactive , there were only around four thousand of us. now there are thirty three thousand. it's only been about three years since january. how long have you guys been here for? has anyone else been here for as long as i have? i... probably won't recognize any of your names, honestly. i suck with reddit usernames and until the last three months or so, i never looked at them, even. would be interesting to see how far back y'all have been active here for, though annnnd the obligatory reminder of the fact that we've a new discord server for the subreddit and anyone else https: discord.gg rrjhqcturr seeya everyone : ",

"sexual gratification from eating?. okay this is a really weird one, and please only reply if you re an adult as i m 24 and am not comfortable discussing this with minors. minors go away do not read and dni okay so since my anorexia has gotten to its worst, i ve found that when i eat a big meal after a couple weeks of severe restriction, it gives me sexual gratification. like i feel sexually aroused from eating something extremely sugary or eating fast food after restricting for awhile. i ve also noticed a similar thing with the hunger pangs after not eating for awhile. i feel so weird and gross about this. i ve never had any sort of food kink before, and it makes me feel disgusting. i just want to know if anyone else at all has gone through something similar or if i m just exceptionally weird. thank you guys so much in advance.",
"triggering kid in my class. today was my first day back to school while being in recovery and this girl in my class is so triggering. she constantly talks about how she has an ed and she kept coming up to me and saying things like guess i shouldn t eat , i m saving my cals , and i wish i didn t feel hunger so i could just starve the first time it happened i told her to stop and said i m in recovery and don t want to hear things that could trigger me but she just kept talking about her ed and i m worried i will relapse because of it",

"god i hope people understood what stuff to say. i had a horrible eating disorder 3ish months ago. i lost my period and i didn't used to poop for days and fall down as soon as i stood up and puke after eating. well i went to therapy. i've been doing better. i'm eating now even tho i still fear it. i'm so angry at the people i love tho. my dad keeps talking about calories and hot my stomach buldges out in particular dresses and stuff after me telling him a million times not to on a daily basis. my mom and partner had been a bit supportive but they sometimes so get on my nerves too. yesterday i had finished exercising and i was extremely hungry and there was no food at home so i made some ramen. only later to hear from my mom about how i did wrong by eating unhealthy and stuff. i stood up for myself saying nothing is bad cause that's what my therapist told me. she told me to eat anything i could when i'm hungry. but nvm, my mom didn't understand and kept saying it. later i was telling my partner about this incident and he just said he agrees with her and that i did wrong by eating that. i just told him i'll ttyl and left. now i also have a recent history of self harm. i was doing fine but recently after both my parents and partner said stuff regarding unhealthy foods and calories and stuff i've really been wanting to hurt myself or start stopping to eat again. istg, i hate when they do this. i hate them.",
headaches. i feel like i m eating more but being punished by these insane headaches. has anyone learned any tricks to manage them? thank you,
eating around roomates housemates. i was wondering if anyone else struggles trying to organise eating cooking when you're living with others? i have very specific foods i eat but i'm always wondering if and when the kitchen will be free to escape judgement but it's so frustrating when i can't guarantee any time i'll be alone. for example i have gotten into a weird habit of eating popcorn at any time of day but its so loud and smelly that i absolutely hate making it often with others around because they all know.,

"restriction amp;exercise vent. idk what happened but i must confess tonight i am struggling. i've been dealing with restrictive eating habits since may this year. tonight, i think i experienced my first big panic attack about my body size after shaving my legs and seeing just how fat my legs are. so regardless of the fact that i hardly ate anything today and spend most of the day on my hands and knees cleaning, i went on an hour long walk tonight too. several times on that walk i started to feel faint. my vision kinda shifted for a second at one point, but i kept going and didn't stop to rest at all. i guess i just need to rant and say that i'm sarcastically, ofc reeeeallllyyy looking forward to this becoming a larger part of my life as this stupid disorder takes over my brain. i fall victim so easily to new disorders...",
"im miserable tw for restricting and self harm . ive been eating somewhat normally if you discount the past couple days for 2 weeks and i feel so fucking bad about it. im really stressed because i have a theory test tomorrow and i always struggle with things like that, and ive managed to piss off everyone in my life. i can't handle myself failing at anything, like literally anything. ive not been restricting and i don't have any blades for self harm, so ill hit myself. if i mess up on a video game or fail another mock test then i get really bad compulsions to punish myself. my bf is mad at me cos i hit myself again, my sister is mad at me cos i shouted at her earlier for annoying me while i was studying. im a failure and i can't handle it so i take it out on everyone else. i mess up everything, i can't even have fucking anorexia properly i have to convince everyone who deals with me that im not a lying sack of shit. i just hate myself, i miss restricting even though its only been a couple weeks and idek why im trying to eat normally because all it does is upset me and then everyone else gets in a bad mood because im no fun to be around anyone who reads this im sorry for the stupid self hating post i know its annoying, i wanted somewhere to complain cos i don't really talk to anyone about this stuff. thanks for reading anyways though",
"one of my closest friends has been severely anorexic for a very long time. it s worse than it s ever been and it s only getting worse. is there anything i can do at all?. my 2 m close friend adrian 18m is very anorexic. i ve known him for about 6 years, and in the past 3 4 years i ve seen him go from kinda chubby to skin and bones. he really likes how he looks now and it really scares me. i haven t seem him eat a single thing when we hang out in years, and we ll hang out like whole days and he ll always insist he just isn t hungry. he claims his mom is trying to get him a nutritionist and more frequent therapy sessions but i really want something to happen now. i m so scared for him and i don t know what to do or the right thing to say, i feel like all i can do is fake a smile and watch him get progressively worse.",
"what should i do?. background information: i m 15f and last year i suffered from anorexia. idk if this is what is affecting me but i have been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and ocd. my depression has got much better over this past year. when i was a kid, i have this memory that sticks in my head of my dad coming into my room grabbing my stomach not in a forceful way and saying i was a pig. sometimes he calls me fat or when i stress eat, he says oh, you re going to eat all of that? and i think since i have adhd, all of this stuff resonates inside my head, like every time i walk past him it s all i can think about. however, to most people im not considered overweight, and always have been under the average weight for my age and height, but i would think about it so much that i would hate myself every time i look in the mirror and be disgusted when myself when i did eat. my mom says that my dad was overweight when he was a kid, and his parents did the same thing to him and that he doesn t know any better. my dad really cares for me and i know he doesn t mean to do it and that he s still working on himself, but im still extremely insecure about myself. last year, it was to the point where i would just not eat and sometimes i would faint, and i almost cracked my skull open because i fainted fell on the floor head first which hurt for like a few mins but i m very grateful to not have needed to have gone to the hospital . i feel like i m relapsing. sometimes i feel extremely insecure and i m absolutely terrified of ever reaching 12 pounds i m 5 5 and about 11 right now. i have no idea on what to do, any advice? the relapse of anorexia right now isn t as bad as last year, but i still have terrible body image ",
is it just me. when i eat i have a focus on protein. i m so scared to eat fruit on its own since it could lead to blood sugar spikes that will give you cravings. so when i eat i have higher volume still very low cal but abnormally high in protein meals. i m just wondering if anyone else is like this or if it s just me. cause protein is also suuuuper filling.,
"quitting nicotine. i ve been vaping for 5 years and im trying so hard to quit, but my appetite has been going crazy. does anyone have any advice?",
"is this a binge?. i ve been heavily restricting for a couple of months now. but i m home right now for vacation and for my parents sake long story i ve been trying to eat normally even though it s really tough. what started as a n act that i m eating a little bit more than what i usually eat, soon became something like a recovery not a full on actual one, but more like temporary . i guess this was because i m at my lowest weight right now and i m scared? everyone i see are telling me how sick and malnourished i look. so i think that made me eat a tiny bit more? so the thing is, today is the last day im home and i ll be leaving tomorrow, and what started as a evening snack a kiwi and guava soon became something like a binge? i haven t binged before so idk if this is it, but i pretty much ate loads of savoury stuff im not even exaggerating it s more than what normal healthy people eat , a entire bar of chocolate, a pack of biscuits etc. im already planning on going back to restriction once i get back to uni, but the thought that dominated my mind was like i have to eat as much as i can at home and go back to restricting, and i said to myself i shouldn t do this again. so is this a binge? is it a sign i should start recovery, but i do have heavy restricting thoughts still. idk why i did this im confused? am i going to binge here on ? what is it ? someone helppp update: ashamed af to say this but i purged not entirely what i ate, but almost half of it ",
"the absolute biggest scam is thinking that you will love your body once you finally reach your goal weight, whatever that may be. i know this is not at all an original thought, but damn is it the truth. i really relapsed and wasted the last few years of my life being absolutely miserable and for what. i am unhealthy and i became utterly miserable, but i sure hit that goal. and then the next and the next. and i only got more miserable with time. i just wish this is what i could communicate to those just falling into disorder. or that me saying it would make any kind of difference for them. but just know that it s really really true. it will not make you happy. it won t make you love yourself. you won t ever be satisfied. shit will just hit the fan until you have to make a change, or one is made for you. this is just my personal experience and opinion but i just want it to be known and really heard. so so much love to all. please take care of yourselves, please",
"the most liberating thing about recovery. i spoke with my family doctor the other day amp; she suggested i eat 4 times a day amp; just eat what i can physically handle. it doesn t have to be a full meal but over time i ll be able to eat more. since i ve been eating 4 times a day, i noticed that i get hungry earlier. most days i don t have my first meal until 7 9 pm. today, i didn t feel like eating bc i wasn t hungry but i made myself eat something small bc i relapse so quickly and i m trying to avoid that. i think i can get through this ",

"when a family member confronts you. im so shaken up. after a long day of running errands and genuinely forgetting to pack snacks i came home and was planning on making a sandwich. i havent had a sandwich in such a long time, but i really wanted one and was going to treat myself because i had been so incredibly busy today. so as i start making it she approached me and asked what id eaten today. then she told me shes been watching me and she knows everything. i just stare at her and im trying not to cry. shes not hugging me, or asking if im ok. she had the worst look in her eyes. she knows my history of anxiety and panic attacks so i dont know why she is confront me like this, right before im about to eat, especially. she started questioning me about various moments over the past few months. at this point i cannot bring myself to finish making my sandwich. and my anxiety levels are skyrocketing. she kept bringing up past incidents at doctors offices and at home and says she's gonna be watching me from now on. says this time she wont take any excuses. i bought some of my usual safe food from a store today and she asked me why i buy those super specific foods, and what i think im doing. i just had no response. for dinner tonight she made homemade fried chicken and all of that oil made me nauseous but i forced myself to quietly eat two plates in front of her. i didnt go on my usual run tonight and shes been ignoring me since. to be fair i haven't talked to her either. but its because i dont know what to do. im so bloated because of how much sodium i forced myself to consume. i didnt enjoy it at all. i feel so nervous and scared. has anyone been in a similar situation. or can offer words of advice. i feel absolutely terrified right now. worst way to start my week. im mad at myself and mad at her for bringing it up in an angry way and right before i was about to eat, too. i dont know how im ever gonna eat in front of her again, knowing shes watching my every move. i dont know the next steps from here. why couldnt she have just asked me if i was ok or tried to comfort me. i feel so terrible",
"i think i realized today i have a problem . my story may be triggering because i m confused and want context for y all s opinions : i m 27 years old and i ve had a very rough year i got very sick with stomach ulcers and began a bad food intake habit. i started shedding weight quickly i was a bigger girl too . i became self obsessed tbh i didn t wanna stop i started liking myself again and at the time not eating or little to none was easy because of the pain. but, it became more very fast, i realized i started pushing myself to not eat, then started to actually push the hunger away, and the scale was obsessive, the compliments kept me going and then bam. i looked in the mirror one day and was confused, i was skinny but my face is aging, my body is weak, i m tired all the time, i can t stand up without getting light headed, i sit in the shower, my hairs falling out, heart palpitations regularly, every morning it s hard to breathe. but my blood pressure and pulse is fine when i go to the doctors. i start therapy tomorrow but i m anxious. sometimes i eat 1 meal and some small snacks a day which makes me feel like it s not really as bad as my body feels? if that makes sense but i started research it s a year now i ve been doing this. i m anemic now, and my face is so sad looking and my skin isn t right. i don t look healthy anymore. i haven t weighed myself in a month and i m spiraling over it because the body dysmorphia. i have kids i don t want to die and i m scared i m getting close. i just teeter the idea i m not as bad because i randomly don t restrict as much but the thoughts never leave.",

"i'm scared of recovery.. everyone says if you recover you'll become fat and have saggy skin, cellulite, etc. because you fucked up your metabolism, so if you start recovering you'll become fat since you're in starvation mode and your body will hold onto everything and make you fat, and that you won't have muscle so your skin will be untoned and saggy. and they said you'll start binging. i'm so scared of that.......and i also feel like anorexia is something that is ""me"" and without it, who am i? i know it's stupid. i just wanna die. why'd i get myself into this mess.",

"jealous of smokers. i live in a kid s home with 3 other kids and 2 of them smoke tobacco and vape. they hide in their bedrooms all day long, without eating or interacting with others, and only leave in the late afternoon or evening. i rarely see them eat and if they do it s their only meal of the day. they slowly and apathetically toy with their food and get really distracted by their phones and can t finish an entire normal sized meal. it really triggers my eating disorder and makes me feel so envious. there is also this kid in my home who doesn t smoke but he plays video games all day long and constantly needs reminding to eat. in the morning he is asked if he wants some breakfast and he almost always says no. i hate how big my appetite is and how i easily blaze through 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and still feel ravenously hungry. i feel so fat and greedy when compared to them. i ask the staff if i eat more than them and they don t think i do but i genuinely think i eat the most. i wish i had access to cigarettes or other stimulants such as speed so i could completely lose my appetite and sense of taste as if by magic. i don t care about my health. all i care about is eating less and losing weight. it s so hard to recover from an eating disorder when you are constantly surrounded by people who smoke or get way too distracted by video games to eat.",

"am i crazy should i get help?. hi, in 2 14 2 16 i think i struggled with an eating disorder restricted, purged, obsessed over food etc but when i sought medical advice to see if i did have an ed the doctor said well you look fine to me . ever since then i ve always felt like my eating disorder was a lie, or all in my head, or i was just making it all up for attention. fast forward to 1 month ago, i feel like i relapsed, but idk if i can even say that because idk if i even had a real eating disorder before. but within this 1 month, ive lost enough weight in a significant way, and now i am def underweight. if i were to seek medical attention though would this be considered to be anorexia? i definitely fit all the other criteria just worried if it still goes by a certain weight number in order to be officially diagnosed. i just really don t feel like being invalidated by the health care system for a number is an experience that might be helpful to right now. but am also experiencing other health issues i m not sure i should go to the hospital for difficulty breathing, heart rate of 15 at rest, faint and weak and heaty palpitations that have very strong heart pumps, nausea etc. should i go checked out?",

"in recovery and really struggling at my highest weight. hey guys, so i have been trying to recover from my ed for about three years now with no luck because i cannot afford therapy or the kind of program you usually go to for this sort of thing. in the last year or so i decided i'm tired of living this way and to just go ahead and eat and ditch the exercise. this was really difficult for me because i was an athletics coach and personal trainer for years, so cutting out exercise was a huge lifestyle change for me. i started going to the gym and have been maintaining my weight for a month and a half now. recently went to visit my family and they made comments about my weight gain since i am slightly overweight not really though. it depends on what chart you look at . everyone else in my family is skinny and i think my mom has an eating disorder also. i explained to them what happened and they eased up but i know they all think i'm fat and probably talk about it when i'm not there. i usually feel really confident these days, which has been awesome. i never felt so confident and happy with myself when i was restricting. the only problem is someone took a picture of a yoga class i taught this morning and i look really fat i was so proud of myself and all the work i had been doing to get my life together up until this point. i'm so upset and ashamed that i got so upset over one picture which doesn't even look that bad and tbh i'm proud of how jacked i am after only a month in the gym . i feel like i've always been so self conscious of my appearance and always think that i look horrible but at least when i was restricting i didn't have to worry about looking fat in photos i wish i could just have both a skinny body and the kind of life that comes when you actually eat well. i feel so stupid. after almost a year of working on undoing my bad eating habits and building myself up and feeling good i keep having these upsets where i see myself and i'm kind of big and i just lose it. i know my family thinks i'm ugly and i fucking deserve it for being so sick in the first place. why can't i just look good again? ? ? ? i never want to go back to restricting and all of the horrible habits i had gotten into which almost killed me many times. i'm just angry because i know i'll never be skinny like that again because it is not healthy and not conducive to the kind of active lifestyle i want to live. i know for a fact though that people will always see pictures of me when i was skinny and make those lame comments like ""wow you were so beautiful when you were younger"" as if i wasn't fucking dying at the time. i looked through old photo albums and you can see me get skinnier and skinnier with every passing year. it's depressing i'm just terrified now. i want to look good the way i did when i was skinny, but i know what's best for me is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and self confidence my increased confidence definitely came from my weight gain because random men finally left me the fuck alone so i could think and speak for myself . living this way has changed my life so much in the past few months for the better, i never want to restrict again. i just want to look good.",

"i think i have an ed and idk if i want to recover. i ve never dealt with an ed until i think i developed undiagnosed anorexia a few months ago and it s been so scary. i ve been very knowledgeable about eds my whole life many people around me have had them and i have done a lot of research and so i knew exactly what was going on the moment it started, which makes me feel so ashamed because i didn t try to stop it. i initially didn t even want to lose weight but i started restricting my food intake because it felt good for some reason control, gender dysphoria, body image issues, self harm behavior? idk . i have since lost weight and restrict even more now. eating makes me so anxious now and i avoid a lot of foods. i barely recognize my behavior compared to a few months ago. i even bought a scale and have done c s which makes me feel so ashamed. but now i want to lose more weight and i m so scared of eating normally and going back to my previous weight. the logical part of my brain is saying that this is clearly ed behavior and i should try to recover before it gets worse. it feels like it would be so easy to stop. the other part of my brain is saying i m not sick enough to recover. it s only been a few months and i m not even underweight, so how am i supposed to recover from nothing? i want to lose more weight, i like the feeling of my jeans being looser now. i feel like i m going crazy i can t stop thinking about food and my body. i feel so ashamed for knowingly giving myself an ed, but suddenly i don t feel like i have control over it anymore. why did i go out of my way to buy a scale and feel happy about it? i m also non binary and want to get a breast reduction next year. i m terrified of getting it and then gaining weight and my chest getting bigger again. i don t even know what i would do i m so scared. anyways i m in therapy and on antidepressants. i feel so embarrassed to be going to to therapy every week and not changing my behavior at all. i just don t know if i want to change. i don t really want to stop but i know i should. i just needed to vent somewhere, thanks for reading: ",

"it can get better. i promise.. all through high school, i had a pretty severe ed i struggled mainly with anorexia . my parents fueled a lot of it, and i developed a super unhealthy relationship with exercise i was running varsity cross country . although i loved running, my ed slowly degraded my relationship with the sport. i continued engaging with my ed in college, and was running for my collegiate cross country team before my body gave up. i was medically pulled from all exercise by both my athletic trainer and my team physician i couldn't even go for walks alone . i didn't want to recover, but once i lost the privilege to exercise, i did miss running. three months after getting medically pulled and after multiple recovery relapse episodes i finally decided that really putting effort into recovering could be worth it. this journey has been so hard, and i still have my fair share of bad days, but it has been so worth it. i just started running again, and i am injury and exhaustion free for the first time in months recovery has been so hard and scary, but i am much healthier physically, mentally, and emotionally since i started. i know that it's easier said than done, and no recovery process is linear, but it really can and does get better. virtual hugs to everyone that needs them today lt;3",

"need advice for friend roommate with anorexia. hi, throwaway and really hoping she doesn t use reddit let alone this thread. i m hoping to get some advice or be pointed in the right direction to get advice. one of my close friends roommates f22 has anorexia and has made a promise to me and her therapist to attempt recovery, and she requested she do it from home so she can keep working remotely. important info: her parents are not involved in her life . i had one session with both my friend and her team who talked to both of us about accountability and what that looks like for my friend. i m more than happy to take on this role and keep my friend accountable, i love her and care about her and her recovery is important to me. however, she clearly does not want to be held accountable. she does not have an option to move out due to finances which is probably for the best. i am not forcing her to do anything, per therapist instructions. i simply point out when she is lying about food exercise and remind her when she forgets about meals snacks. but recently she s told me that she doesn t need a parent and she doesn t need to be policed. i told her it s obviously not my intention, but i m trying to keep her from ending up in the hospital and she knows that i have to tell her team the truth if she is not making an effort. i don t want to, and i hate that it s an ultimatum i just want to see more effort on her end. we set up boundaries in therapy before starting this accountability thing. she is independent in almost every other aspect, so i don t feel like i have to do everything for her. outside of this we have an incredible relationship and i do view her as a sister. any other tips on how i can stop coming off as overbearing? anything else i can do to support? i am a little nervous she agreed to this with no intentions of following through to avoid going to treatment.",

"vent. my ed ruined my relationship. yeah, title. i met her at the lowest point in my life as an insecure teenager, and thanks to her i learnt to love myself and my life. we spent 3.5 years together and she was the most incredible person i've ever met. everything i always thought someone like me didn't deserve, but for some reason she saw something in me. she knew i'd had a few eds in the past, but i was fine for most of our relationship. earlier this year i relapsed because of a conversation i had with a friend. i fell into it kinda hard, especially cause summer was coming up. and as you know eds take away from every other aspect of your life. i was naive and thought that our love for each other would somehow make us immune to this. but as the months went by i was isolating even from her, being distracted with my own appearance, ignoring her texts cause logging my intake was somehow more important, we had sex less and less often cause of my insecurities when she'd never said anything negative about my appearance. so about 2 months ago she just told me we'd grown apart and the person i'd become wasn't who she needed anymore. she me her outright mentioned an eating disorder, but that's pretty much what it was. i spent the whole night crying but i couldn't even be mad at her. she needed someone who can pay attention to her and maintain a relationship, i feel like being anorexic made me too selfish for her. part of me wishes she'd done something wrong, but she didn't, so my only choice is to see myself as the villain. i know it's possible for neither of us to be the bad guy, my brain knows that but my heart doesn't feel that way. i blame myself for it. a lot. especially knowing she would love me no matter what my weight was, and i fucked everything up by caring about just that im not happy with myself. i know i didn't choose to have anorexia but it feels like if i just tried harder to recover, she would still be with me. i keep replaying moments where i was preoccupied with myself and i could have done something for her instead. i really regret that i didnt tell her things got bad again, i knew for a fact she'd support me, but i also knew she'd be worried and try and stop me from getting worse. so i just kept it to myself and now she thinks i don't prioritize her anymore. and it's too late to tell her now cause it would just feel like i'm guilting her into getting back with me again, and it's over anyways, she made her decision and i can't change it now. i've never felt so stupid in my life. we met when we were both 15, now we're 19 and 2 . the girl who i practically grew up with, was planning on marrying, consider the love of my life, gone all cause of a fucking eating disorder. it's been a wake up call, but i still can't bring myself to recover. i'm not even emotionally stable enough to try. i have no idea what to do with myself again just so no one worries too much, i have plenty other people who are there for me and thank god for that, i have no intentions of hurting myself either. just very, very heartbroken is all. i don't know where else to vent cause i still don't want anyone worrying, but i needed this off my chest. thanks for reading",

"i don't know what to think about this... trigger warning: this post contains talk about weight, no numbers are mentioned, body image, mentions of behaviors such as calories counting, purging, excessive exercising, binging. stay safe hi i'm lillith, just to put down some context, i'm a minor, undiagnosed, and while i can't officially say that i have an ed, it's pretty obvious that i do. my ed kinda consists of what i call ""phases"" i have a phase where i'm full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. then the other is binging. it doesn't stsy long a week or so and doesn't happen often, it's triggered when i don't get food i'm body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, i then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. sometimes when i have no choice i eat like a ""normal person"" but try to burn it off by exercising i do at home biking and sometimes sit ups . what triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. i had gained a lot during the summer bc i did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, i shed the pounds naturally when i got back to school because i would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn't snake at school. tw: numbers talk about my weight so i went from kg for 164cm in august, to kg for 165cm in november. then i started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school my friends called them my fangirls they would say i was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you're so thin that's so cool i crave compliments, affection, i want to keep it forever, i have a past with bullying and parents i disappointed cuz i wasn't diagnosed with adhd until 8th grade so really . i would rarely get compliments, so now i do everything to keep them. while i was someone who didn't want to care about they way i looked because i knew i was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. my mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack ""be careful you're going to end up like this summer"" i slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of g made its way into my head. so here was the starting point of my ed. now i'm kinda deep into it but it's summer break so skipping meals is hard, i try to exercise, i skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don't so i can't. but i also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. here's the thing, i don't like throwing up, but that didn't stop me from trying to make myself purge, i've never been able to though. until today, i was trying to purge but couldn't, i went on internet, searched ""how to make yourself puke"" found something, tried it once, succeeded. i did about three times until i just couldn't bc i still don't like to throw up. i exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. i felt the dizziness i feel when ""it's working"" i'm used to it and it's strangely satisfying since i associate it with weight loss. the purging too, while i still don't like to puke, i had this feeling of satisfaction. now, i don't know what to think about this... did i just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ed? or is it just me being dramatic about it, and i probably won't pick up on this behavior? searching for some advice : i hope what i said was clear, have a nice day night ",

"diagnosed with anorexia nervosa but after looking into it im not sure?. i ll try to keep this short but i ve struggled with generalized anxiety disorder since i was a kid and being too anxious to eat on and off for a few years now that i can remember. i know i ve always had trouble gaining weight though. about three years ago i got a shot for birth control and it made me gain quite a bit in a year, after previously struggling to get above the underweight mark. but now after some things changed in my life and was in a high stress living situation, my inability to eat returned. i became severely depressed and don t remember how long i wasn t eating for as all my days were heavily blended together but i know it was several months. my weight dropped down a huge amount and i almost had to be hospitalized about half a year ago. i got a doctor to help and explained that it wasn t a conscious decision or image based, i just get nauseous sometimes and physically cannot eat for long periods of time. i got the diagnosis and started medication that was supposed to help and never thought about it again. it took a few months to get my appetite back and slowly start gaining weight again but sometimes if i forget to eat for a day it ll come back, and i ll be too nauseous to eat for days from that point. and just have to wait until i feel like i can eat. i m in one of those situations now and upset with myself because i want to eat but physically feel like i cant, and don t want to lose any progress i ve made with gaining weight back recently which is what usually happens . but i looked the diagnosis up and almost everywhere it says that it s a self image thing and almost a conscious decision because you don t want to go above your desired weight. which has never been me. so i was just wondering can it be both or was i maybe misdiagnosed? i also hope none of this came across as rude or insensitive just genuinely trying to figure out more about my eating issues",

"clothes makes the...?. back story: i'm 36 and have had an ed, mostly anorexia, for years in the past. i recovered, mostly, despite being discharged with a 'management' plan rather than a relapse prevention plan. i've been more or less healthy for a decade and i basically ate whatever i wanted trying to avoid triggering relapse. i've had a higher weight than i could be comfortable with after my second baby, and i was not happy with my 'sugar addiction'. anyhow. a year ago i got sick with something like long covid but not long covid. i burned myself out because i am still the same idiot who tried to climb mountains with a very low weight and anaemia by keeping going and basically i've had nausea very often, leading to weight loss, and after getting a really bad bout of depression, basically some profoundly anorexic stuff in my mind. and the weight is beginning to match. so. the clothes. i love clothes, i love making it look good. it's my bit of creative play, and i kind of missed that when i was at my highest weight and during pregnancies because i bought and wore cheaper, poorer fitting clothes with boob access. for breastfeeding, not other stuff . not too long ago, i invested in basically a big wardrobe upheaval because i figured i was at a weight i could and should maintain as a mother and be healthy with it. i had already tossed the baby era clothes a while ago. this weekend i 'had' to basically go through my closet and take out everything that is too big and doesn't really look good if worn 'oversized', it is a lot, and some stuff still have the tags on. i took some of my pre pregnancy clothes off vinted again from the time after the discharge with minimal weight restoration , some things even from uni. i fit the jeans i never intended to fit again but just kept because they remind me of adventures. my body has definitely changed. and i don't know how to feel about it. the intention is positive: i want to look put together, i want to be kinder towards myself, i want to actually not draw attention to my weight. i want to not be confronted with clothes that should fit but don't everyday. my anorexic mindset enjoys it but fuck her. but in the end: isn't this kind of defeat? or is it acceptance? realistically i know that for now the only attainable goal would be to stop losing weight, but it also feels like defeat and maybe a bit crazy. anyway. that's all. i just needed to say that.",

"faking recovery. tw i m home for holidays and i m staying with my parents i m at my lowest weight right now with heavy restriction but now that i m home i can t keep restricting because i ve convinced my parents that i m eating more and trying to gain weight they don t know that i have an ed, they just know that i m losing too much weight . this means i have to atleast pretend that i m eating more even tho what i do is sneak food away . i have to stay with them for 3 weeks which means a hell lot of food and maybe even going out for meals. i ll have to eat more than normal portion sizes and i m really really anxious and panicked. i m afraid i m gonna gain a lot of weight, but i cant show that i m restricting so i m in a horrible position. this is also triggering my purging behaviour im already purging every meal can someone please tell me if i d gain weight? if so, will it be a lot of weight? i don t workout either. i have to do this atleast for them but i ll probably relapse someone please tell ill be back to normal after this fake recovery im in no place to actually recover, so i hope you guys understand my situation ",
suggestions for my daughter who is a twin. i have twin girls and one has anorexia. she will not eat unless her sister eats a certain amount of food that she has her eat. once her sister eats the proper amount to her then she will finally eat. it is not enough but it is something. looking for suggestions on how to break this . we are going to emily program ina few weeks i hope but need some ideas right now. thank you,
"just something i hate. maybe i m alone on this but the amount of assumptions about eating disorders piss me off. there s no weight requirement for having an ed, the psychologist isn t gonna be like okay so you present all the signs but you don t weigh under x so ya can t be diagnosed okay? bye bye now . not all eating disorders start because of weight, they can and usually do turn into being weight related but usually involve something different psychology i.e. control issues, ocd, etc etc . and lastly, the idea that eating disorders are only serious when you look sick. if you don t, then everyone says omg tell me how you lost the weight or omg how d you get those curves . if you look attractive, people don t care and it s irritating. anyway that s my little rant on a few assumptions i absolutely hate",

tw; relapse. i m starting to relapse heavily right now. i don t know honestly. whenever i starve myself i just feel more validated and such. constantly checking the scale to see if the number is going down too adds more too the validation because it feels like i m in control and if i ever fuck up then i can starve myself and then gain pleasure from it when i see the number go down. i lost a lot of weight in the past few days and i ve been averaging around a very low amount of calories a day. i think i m relapsing and hard right now. i don t know how to quit though. whenever i eat i feel so guilty i m at a loss of appetite. i don t know what to do. i m so lost right now. it s constantly straining.,

"i hate this, getting pissed at my mom for buying to much fruit. logically i know it's stupid. i am usually almost the only one that eats the fruit at home, because of this my brain things that if my mom buys more fruit than i asked for that keans she wants to force me to eat it. plus having more options at home stresses me the hell put and either triggers binges or me not eating for days. my brother saying ""you don't have to eat anything"" doesn't help. i know he meants not anything specific i don't want like but to me it sounds like he's telling me i don't need to eat and i want to prove that to b true. he and my mom tell me i need to learn to deal with it and that the world doesn't revolve around me and that she doesn't buy it for me. but that makes it worse, her buying stuff for me would be bad too i think. don't get me wrong i know i am the issue in this, it's no ones responsibility than mine but my head just messes with me. i hate how irritable this ilness made me. at thw same time i want my mom to buy things i like to eat to encourage me but she wouldn't do that anymore unless i asked. she does that because i couldn't hanlde it well in the past either. but somehow i wish she would. or i wish my brother wouldn't say ""but you wouldn't eat that anyway"" in regards to certain food that are fear foods of mine. i ruined it for myself. my family doesn't even ask me anymore if i want something when they are ordering takeout. i lost count how many times they ordered pizza or something without even asking me if i want something too. it hurts. i could never ask. this is just me ranting about how ana ruined my already bad relationship with my family. i just came back from a road trip with my brother and we got into so many fights because my mood was ruined by a meal i ate. i'm so angry at myself because i gained weight and i'm not even underweight anymore. it just messes my head up more.",
"should i text a girl i barely know to ask if she needs help?. hi so lately, i've seen this girl i had met about 1 years ago at a summer camp post a lot of worrying stories of her on instagram. it's always pictures where you can see that she has lost a lot of weight she was already skinny to start with and looks very sick. she didn't post as much before so i'm guessing that it's the illness pushing her to do it more at the moment. i don't know if she's completely oblivious to the fact that she's sick or if she knows but ""likes"" it or if she knows and is implicitly asking for help. i'm very worried. my question is: should i send her a message telling her that if she needs someone to talk to or advice i'm here? or just telling her nicely that she needs to get help. i'm myself a pretty much recovered anorexic so i would not be coming out of nowhere. i'm just afraid that getting such a message would be a bit brutal but i'm also afraid that no one else is doing anything and that it might actually go downhill for here... any thoughts?",

life is so much more than food. i really felt smth yesterday and i want to try to use it to motivate some of yall. ive always known life can be bautifull and filled with so much joy we just close our eyes to see we burry our heads in this world where nothing else exept our weight and food matter when in reality this trully is the least important thing. we are so much more than our temporare home the bodies we abuse our souls are aching to set themselves free and experience all the wonders life has to offeer feel all the emotions and sometimes just be.im gonna sound like a 5 year old facebook lady but the universe is so big and full of oppertunity magick and hope and we just need to slowly learn to see it. we dont live to count our cals and plan the food we are ab to eat or the one we arent.we are beautiful human beings all we have to do is exist in a way that makes us feel and experience the world we live in look at the stars dance in the forest go on night drives travel meet new people fall in love. if you are sick of everyone making recovery all ab food and eating it is not only that its what comes after after we give life to our tired bodies after we start taking care of ourselves and allow our minds and bodies the love and rest they need.all of us are capeble of change and no matter how hard it is we can do it because we are better than that we are better than romantisizing our litteral death. this thing inside of us is just trying to blind us put us in a cage and kill us but only if we allow it too.i can go on and on this is by far not even 1 of what i have to say but ill need to stop.fight and dont lose hope there is light at end of the tunnel i promise you ,

"what the fuck are hunger and fullness cues. recovery is unveiling some bad psychological damage restrictions left me with. in restriction i used my emotions to gauge wether or not i was gonna eat hungry or not it didn t matter, if i felt i could control myself if i ate then it s a go usually that meant eating when i wasn t hungry and being very clearly hungry and wanting food badly usually meant i wasn t eating. and now i have these weird associations with hunger like guilt and shame and panic of running in the other direction. but i m also not actively trying to restrict so i don t need to feel as in control around food as i once did so now wanting food is being mistaken for hunger. idk man it s all so fucked up recovery is so hard i feel like i m walking tightrope and on either end is some terrible fate waiting to eat me. this is gonna sound weird but recovery is starting to feel like damage control.",

do feel comfortable talking to your general practitioner about ed related issues?. my dietitian wanted me to start taking ensure for bad eating days. here it has to be subscribed by a medical professional . i m always uncomfortable bringing the subject up but i managed to talk to her about it. her answer? that s stupid just go have chipotle or eat something high in calories. you don t need it wasn t going to argue with her but definitely not going to share ed problems with her any more ,
"i ve been recovered for 3 years but i still feel like falling apart whenever i see myself in photos or acknowledge my body s existence. so, as the title says, i m recovered and know that my body is healthy. however, whenever i see photos of myself i just fall apart. i even cover my face on my employee badge because it s like any kind of acknowledgment i exist is a punch to the gut. i don t know how to escape this cycle of complete self misery surrounding photos or images. i know i m better, physically, but whenever i see myself all i can see is a monster. if someone asked me to draw a self portrait of myself it d probably not look how i actually do at all. i don t think the way i see myself is how i look in reality at all. i plan on getting more help for how i m feeling but it s just really hard to never feel pretty, as shallow as that sounds. i needed to tell someone how i feel because there is no one in my life who understands why or how i can feel this way.",
"is a dietician nutritionist actually helpful and why?. i ve been restricting and exhibiting other eating disorder behaviors for awhile now. i talked to my regular therapist about it more significantly than i ever have, and as eating disorders are out of her scope, she is strongly suggesting i see a nutritionist. regardless, i will continue to see my regular therapist for anxiety, depression, and trauma. my question is: what is the value of a dietician or nutritionist? in your experience how has that been valuable for you? should i also be looking into an eating disorder specific therapist? also, does anyone have any experience in self directed eating disorder recovery? would appreciate any feedback or info about experiences.",

"need advice on how to help my gf. since my girlfriend f28 was 18, she has been experiencing pain in her lower abdomen, gastritis, and constipation. when she's in pain, she doesn't eat and this has caused a severe weight loss. she went through a lot of tests for celiac disease, gastroscopy with a biopsy, colonscopy, ct scans, nmrs, rectal manometry, blood tests, etc. and none of them helped identify her problem. lately her constipation got really really bad, to the point where she needs a micro enema every day to pass a stool; if she doesn't, she immediately starts experiencing pain in her lower left abdomen and the more she waits before going, the worse this pain gets. i'm starting to think it might be a mental issue, like atypical anorexia nervosa and i would like some kind of feedback before suggesting this different approach to my gf. what do you guys think?",

need to vent. tw in case ok so two different things they ve just both been on my mind. first thing i weighed myself for the first time since last year before i was anorexic and now i m underweight and i m very happy about that but also no one talks about downsides. my clothes are all big on me now. the clothing i bought only a month ago. i m proud of myself but it s also such a struggle wearing too big clothes. second thing today i ate four cookies and i feel like absolute shit. i feel so guilty and i m disgusted with myself. i don t want to eat at all till tomorrow but i have to eat dinner with my mom in a couple of hours but i really am dreading it. i ve eaten too much today the only other thing i had was a banana for breakfast but i just wanted cookies so bad and kept going back.,

"do you know who you are?. after a long and descent talk she finally found out, that she has to change things in her life and tries to recover. while discussing some interesting things came to light. but first some facts: she has an since 9 and is 38 now. she has three kids, one of them, the youngest, is mine the ex partner and father of the other two kids has the mission to make her life as bad as possible, because he hates his self even more. unfortunately he is a good father though. she struggles with her emotions, kids training, trying to get everything in her family life together and to manage that she fled into excessive sports and low food input. i found some interesting things out, maybe you are familiar with that. maybe you could help me to let her help herself: she recalls her entire life to be focused on her weight. this always gave her control. she does not know who she actually is and what the things are, that she loves. there is none. to compensate the lack of her own desires, she gives everything she has to her kids. those are struggling too, due to the years of cruel legal and emotional fights with the ex. because she never had contact with herself, she cannot gain energy, her only desire is to do sports and an stuff so now, after many exhausting years in her living situation she finds herself in a decent mother's burnout with hard depressions and an growing urge of controlling her weight. her life is a mess, and so is mine now. as i am not living with her, i wish she could let the kids go and move to me and stops fighting for them because it destroyes her. not a noble thought, i know. but who could judge me, most do not know how exhausting and messy all this is. and i think this would be the best for all of us, especially for the children. but she as a mother with no other purpose in her life than living for them and barely no self awareness, is so scared doing the step, because there is nothing waiting for her. well i am. and our little 3y old son. but she cannot see this. i believe she never knew what selfcare actually is. do you?",

"vent. i just need to vent. today is the day of the week that i usually let myself have freedom with food. so, tonight is my last chance to just eat freely and not have to restrict. and i really want to make myself some supper, but making and eating food in front of my sister makes me so anxious. well, the thing is that she's in the living room right now and if i make food, she'll see me taking it to my room. and that makes me really anxious and i feel like she's going to judge me. so, i just can't. but i really just want to eat something. i mean, i did eat earlier, but i'm hungry again. and like, my break day is going to be ruined. this always happens. it makes me so frustrated. she's in the living room all day, just watching tv, and i don't even have a fucking second of privacy in the kitchen where i don't feel like she's watching me. i just wish she would go to her room for just five minutes so i could make some food. and i'm also really tired and i want to sleep, but if i do then my break day will be over and i'll have to be back at restricting again.. so by the time she finally goes to bed, i'll be fucking exhausted and barely able to enjoy this day before i'm back to restricting. i just feel like crying. i feel so frustrated and so angry and i'm sorry if this post sounds aggressive. i know it's not her fault, but i just feel so angry anyway.",

"wish i was bigger.. trigger warning restricting and starving ever since i got to a weight that it was noticeable to other people they started worrying and questioning me about me eating and telling me to eat more. when i was bigger and restricting it didnt bother them the amount i ate, anyway not as much as now. if i was bigger again i would be able to starve and restrict again and people wouldnt bother me about it. i know recovery is the only way but i miss being in control i guess. does anyone else feel like this?",

anywhere i can go as a relative to discuss things?. my brother is anorexic and has been for years. has definitely left an impact and i want a place to talk about it. don t want to discuss on an anorexia subreddit because i understand how certain thihgs can trigger people. maybe an anorexic relative support subreddit or something similar if you know of one? thank you,
"parents and 3 week vacation has destroyed me.. i can t blame my parents but this may have destroyed me. i m so defeated. we went overseas to meet new family and they were very pushy about food. but what hurt me the most is that my parents would not listen when i would say no. try this you will regret it don t you like there food awww you don t like my food then when i finally give in to try make them shut up. they say something like oh see you did want it the guilt that causes is so bad. constantly jabbing me and telling me and asking me to try things over and over again until i give in. i could say no 1 x and they still keep going when i say no. i ve been a healthy weight for a while now and i eat pretty normally so there is reason for them to nag me. my step mom even delt with ed for a very long time before i meet her. but she seems to say the most triggering things. they both know what i use to deal with but they just push my buttons constantly. because of this, the fears and thoughts are coming back. i looked at the scales because of this. seeing i ve gained even more weight made me lose it. i just don t understand i m 18 and i ve done everything right. i stoped counting calories i gained weight i stoped the scales. i got a lot better. i eat the right amount . i did it all right. but they seem to think it s a great idea to mention how much i m eating. or joke about how we will gain weight on this vacation. or constantly push food on me. i tell them it makes me uncomfortable but they keep doing it .. why why why do they have to mention food,weight it s so bad. they even post pictures of me with them on social media . i look so bad it s horrible. i m pretty sure i m relapsing. it s just so dumb. i m weighing my self daily the thoughts won t stop everything is back. im so scared . why",
"sexism and misogyny in treatment. a recent post in another non ed sub made me wonder about the way that sexism affects treatment for eds. eating disorders are a stereotypically female disorder though of course men are affected too and i know many of us have had horrifying and traumatic experiences in treatment. i wonder how you all think that sexism affects how we re treated for eating disorders? personally, i think if eds were perceived as a male disorder, treatment would be a lot different. my experience of treatment was that it was patronizing, controlling and invalidating in a way that feels somehow reflective of how it is to be a woman in society. i don t think we re that evolved from treatment of hysteria, or ridiculous freudian ideas about women. i m having a hard time articulating my thoughts on this but would love to hear others thoughts and experiences even if you disagree.",
"feeling guilty.. some background: recently my antidepressant medication has been making me have a lack of appetite, and while the rational side of me wants to mention this to my psychiatrist theres a side of me thats happy about this. ive been going through hard times recently and just a few weeks ago my best friend not only mocked me for opening up to them but ghosted me aswell. this heartbreak led me to start starving myself. at first i wasnt sucessful and i told myself i wouldnt go through with this anymore but i think ive unintentionally developed an ed. today i wanted to not eat anything at all. which sounds hard, but my med's side effect helped. unfortuneatly i just couldnt control myself and ate a brownie. it tasted great, but then the guilt set in. i want to punish myself by not eating, i feel like i dont deserve the luxury of food. im just disapointed in myself.",
"anorexia doesn t just make you skinny if it even does . telling a person that they don t want anorexia because it s good to have some meat on your bones is the worst reasoning in my opinion. there so many worse consequences that come with living this way. the worst part for me isn t even that i m missing out on eating fun foods eating events, i m used to that. the worst part is the horrible, selfish person i become when i restrict. i have wasted so much of my life worrying about food that i can t help but wonder who i could have been if i had done more worthwhile things.",

"feel like i m doomed to be anorexic because of my body type. i always felt like i had a more mild version of anorexia. unlike people who start to self harm at some point in their dieting journey, i always thought i d stop as soon as i become attractive. idk what that really is because i am already underweight but i assume anorexia wants me too loose some more before i look beautiful . in truth, i don t think i would have ever had this disorder if my hips and breasts weren t tiny. my biggest trigger is seeing my stomach stick out past my chest even tho it is still relatively flat. i feel like i would have never starved myself or broken down over my belly if i had boobs. maybe i m delusional. i just feel so gross sometimes. i feel like i m too big and not feminine enough. the only girls with no boobs that i see online have no fat on their bellies, basically extremely thin. that s why i think i should look the same.",

"is there a safe way to talk about nutrition?. background information: i work at a gym and i'm in the national guard so fitness and health should be important to me. most people think i look pretty good and fit but the army always tells me i'm overweight though i always pass bmi tests. i can barely maintain my physique through working out and i know my diet is the problem. i have very poor portion and impulse control eat lots of junk food and generally all of whatever i've gotten. one time i felt good about my appearance i was in an intense deficit and work out routine but i was miserable then i regained the weight and lost the gains. since ive been trying to be better be healthier but ive run into a situation where i've discovered at different times several people i work with are in recovery. it's always like hey have a donut and i'm like i shouldn't i ate huge tub of popcorn last night and they're like it was really hard for me to have this. or another time it hadn't even crossed my mind someone brought in a lot of something that looked great and i said i haven't worked hard enough for that and someone responded with you don't have to earn your food. the point is i participate in a sport and occupation that benefits from being in a healthy weight range, i want my body to feel better about moving my mass around and i just want to be better without trying to offend or disturb others who have a make a concentrated effort to eat at all. it makes me just not wanna talk at all about food even though i feel like i'm struggling with the opposite problem. ive never been diagnosed or anything so it's probably just a discipline thing on my side, i'm kind of a chronic sharer of things i feel are difficult for me and maybe that's the real problem. edit: my goal isn't to debate with people in recovery just express my self in a way that doesn't make others uncomfortable because i've accidentally discovered three freinds in recovery by trying to not accept certain foods.",

"to anyone who is pro ana amp; comes across this subreddit:. i used to be like you. when i was a teenager, i joined those communities. people made challenges and supported each other to get sicker. we would lie to ourselves and claim that we had self control because we would restrict and to focus on the end goal which is reaching x lbs. you think you re in control but you re not. once you reach x lbs, this disease will give you another goal weight . guess what? this disease has only one goal: death. this disease will feed you lies and tell you that the only outcome of restriction is weight loss. it s not. this disease will destroy your body and mind. organ failure, destroying your teeth enamel, osteoporosis, your body eating at your muscles because there s not enough fat in your body, digestive issues, etc. no one in the pro ana community will tell you that. my heart goes out to those who are suffering from this disease,even if they re not aware that they re suffering because of the lies that this disease feeds you. please be kind and take care of yourself if you are looking for a sign to get help recover, this is it. no one deserves to suffer from this disease. stay strong ",

"i m relapsing, but now no one wants to deal with me. last year, i posted on here after being discharged from the hospital, although i was on the brink of death. many things have changed since then i decided to go all in i don t even know what made me start eating normally again, it just happened but then it quickly turned into binge eating. i gained 2 kg in around 3 months, and i became weight restored. of course, gaining so much weight in little time had its consequences. my stomach was permanently bloated, my face was puffy and my thighs seemed huge to me. i decided to go on a self made diet 2 weeks ago i don t have money to afford a dietitian, and now that it s summer they re on vacation anyways , but turns out i m relapsing. i m starting to fear food again, i drink cal drinks to suppress my hunger, i count calories again. i think this happened also because i saw some pics of me from last year, and i realised how much i miss my old body. everything happened so fast, i swear relapsing didn t even cross my mind at first. my mum has noticed my behaviour and she has already told me that after almost witnessing me die she is not willing to put up with me because she s tired and i m almost 19, so choosing whether to eat or not is only my responsibility. i am completely alone, even the online friends i had last year have completely abandoned me. i had a very special friend who was happy i was recovering, she always tried to support me, but after i ghosted her multiple times due to my mental issues she told me she didn t want to speak to me ever again because i hurt her. it made me feel so shitty, and i still feel terrible. honestly, i just want to disappear right now. i can t believe i m spiraling into anorexia again . this time i don t think i will have the energy to fight against this monster. maybe i was bound to lose this battle from the start",

"doom. i feel so utterly broken. i've been dealing with anorexia since i was 12. i went through some very traumatic things because of it. my life wasn't mine because of others. i turned 18 in may and things were going good for the past year and i saw hope. i got my ged, i was no longer at the mercy of idiotic, sadistic even higher ups. my weight has been pretty low for the past year. i was eating well and not restricting. not under the constant threat of hospitals. i was just living life at a weight i felt comfortable at with some ups and downs. gradually over the past couple of months i've been eating less. i was so tired of rigidly eating six times a day and so on a vacation i tried out eating more intuitively and it felt amazing. when i came back home i had lost some weight but not much. my team was happy about my positive experience and hoped i could replicate it at home without losing weight. doing so proved challenging. i ended up just eating less. at one point i got to a number that was a little shocking. deep down though, it felt good. i went up about a pound from that and maintained for a bit. last week was my first weight in a couple of weeks. i can't remember my weight beforehand exactly but the general range. the number couldn't have been up a lot but just seeing it broke my heart. for the first time in years the scale made me cry. i hadn't tried to lose weight intentionally in quite a while but i decided it was time. i barely ate for a few days and quickly could hardly function. i slowly had to begin eating more. by the end of the week i was doing pretty good and i felt good in my body. this morning i awaited the scale, looking for the relief of loss. the appointment was hostile to begin with. when i stepped on the scale, at first i couldn't process it. it was like it wasn't real. somehow, it was a pound up from last week. the number broke me. tears flooded. i was miserable. how, how? what can i do? i ate less and went up? my weakness led the scale up? this has never happened before. i've often quite easily lost weight. i already felt a little pathetic for already being lethargic after a few days of starvation, now i feel hopeless. i haven't eaten all day. i'm just a pile of lethargy and depression. i can hardly manage doing nothing. my whole life i've had the vision of me just fading away into nothingness. becoming an invalid. is that how it ends?",

possible anorexia?. i'm pretty underweight and lately i've been having trouble eating. i'll have days where i eat alot and then suddenly i'll have a couple days where i can't stand food and just force some ramen noodles down my throat out of concern. i feel hungry obviously but the sight of food just doesn't excite me and i feel like throwing up sometimes while thinking of eating. my therapist has been concerned about my weight but we haven't gotten down to why i might be avoiding food and tbh i don't really understand why either. any advice is helpful,

wanting to go back. the fact that people know that i eat makes me extremely uncomfortable. uncomfortable to the point where if people see me eating i have to stop and throw it away and try not to cry. uncomfortable to the point where i never want to eat again when i think about how so many people have seen me eat food or talk about eating food before. when i started at my new job i made a promise that i wouldnt eat at work so nobody there would know i ate. and today i broke that promise and i feel like absolute shit. i can never ever go back and i want to quit now. i love my job and i hate that i want to quit because people know that i eat that is so goddamn stupid.,

how not to relapse when being discharged from ed services. some background info; i have been doing family therapy since feb 2 21 and during that time i had a period at the beginning where i was gaining weight then things went downhill and i lost all of it and plateaued at a low weight then i gained some back but then plateaued at that weight which is slightly underweight according to bmi and that s been the case since jan this year. however bc i have done over a year of therapy which was not consistent and effective i am being discharged on the 1 th of august. their reasoning for this is that i am stable they have said themselves im still underweight but that i need to do it myself and that there isn t any more tools they can give me and they need to take on other referrals. i am 16 and about to start at college uk and this is such a bad time to discharge and i was just wondering how im meant to cope and how i can keep making actual progress after being discharged.,

""i thought i could stop whenever i wanted but when i actually wanted to stop, i couldn't"".... i think i just convinced myself for a little bit that i shouldn't restrict. but it's not enough for my stubborn mind. i'm conflicted within continue to restrict and stop before it's too late. it would be helpful if someone could help convincing me.",

"do i hate sex because of anorexia? edited . hi everyone. the title may be strange so let me get it straight. i have been diagnosed with anorexia when i was still a child so... puberty fucked up at the real start. i still don't have regular period, besides an amazing osteoporosis which makes me waiting for medical appointments sitting next to 6 7 old ladies. and they don't know they are the amateurs, because my bones are classified as 8 9 old women's ones would ; jokes aside, my body is pretty fucked up, physiologically speaking. consequences of not eating enough and balanced are here to see and likely not to be solved soon. i won't go into details about the reasons this topic came to my mind because it involves also another person, but the fact is that i have never felt sexual desires. the idea of sex never comes to my mind, and even if i feel and i swear, i have felt this one when i'm in love or attracted to someone, thinking of doing things with him isn't really a thing for me. i don't feel it necessary. it's kind of repulsing to me. i feel like i am sort of far far faaar away from that sphere. this btw doesn't include hugs, holding hands, kisses, staying in bed only in underwear, but when it comes to touching some ""parts of the body""... i really start to feel uncomfortable. i can say i hate it. times ago i thought i was into the spectre of being asexual, but afterhsome deep thinking about this... well. my question is: do lack of hormones influence sexual desire? is it scientifically explainable? has anyone experienced the same thing?",

"an without body image disturbance?. i know the dsm is flawed and that my struggles are valid even if i don't meet specific criteria, but does anyone else experience this? i genuinely believe i perceive my body as it is at both healthy and low weights. i know atypical anorexia nervosa is a diagnosis, but i've only heard of it in the context of the weight loss aspect being unmet. the reason i bring this up is because much of the discourse surrounding eating disorder awareness and recovery seems to center around body image. i of course support body positivity neutrality; i just wish it wasn't so irrevocably intertwined with all treatment approaches.",

how to stop caring about body image. im in recovery right now and i really want to be able to eat more food and show my parents that i m getting better in recovery but i am so afraid of my body getting bigger and looking fatter than normal. i m short which makes me think that my body looks fat and i really want to know how i m able to overcome this fear of not caring about my body and being able to eat more,
"i don't know how to handle this your thoughts, please kinda long, sorry. before covid, i was in recovery for a really long time, things were going really well, then..... covid hit and i've been stuck in my apartment alone for over two years. well, when you lock an anorexic even one who's in recovery up alone for two whole years and nobody ever sees what they eat or what they weigh... guess what happens? yeah, you know, relapse. a very, very, bad relapse, i got to my lowest weight and bmi ever, to the point i got really scared about endangering my health. well, i'm still restricting, but i've worked really hard and have gotten my bmi up to where i'm not scared i'll have a heart attack tomorrow, only i've got another problem. after covid, i'm getting together with friends again and getting out and especially getting out to hear music most of my friends are artists or musicians and in may i started getting together with one old friend, and he said, ""come on over to my apartment, i'll make dinner, and we'll hang out and talk."" trigger trigger trigger now over the years, i hid my ed from everybody because i felt so ashamed of it and always gave them the usual bullshit about how i had a high metabolism and i'm just naturally skinny, etc. etc. but in may, i had to break down and fess up to this friend, because i was still not in recovery enough to eat in front of him, i told him all about my ed. so he said, ""that's okay, i'll just eat before you come over and i'll wash the dishes and everything because i don't want to upset you or anything."" now, i don't know if you know this about guys, but they never want to talk about feelings or emotional problems or especially about things like an ed. so neither he or i have mentioned my ed since that talk. we have plans to go out to hear some music friday and... i don't know if i should suggest to him that we go out and eat beforehand. we always used to do that. i think maybe i could eat something like a salad, i don't know. l have so much shame about my ed that i really feel so much shame and regret about even telling him about it and i hate bringing it up again. but i also don't want to go through life not eating around my friends, that would feel like such a loss to me. i don't know what to do. any feedback you guys could give me would be welcome. don't worry about triggering me, say anything you want. thank you guys so much, you guys are great, i feel so much love and compassion in what you comment to people.",

"advice on helping a partner with an ed. i felt like making this post to help those who are in relationships with someone with an ed, but anorexia specifically. i feel like the luckiest person alive to be in a relationship with the my partner, they're so good with helping me. this will kinda all be based of what they do for me. also i just wanna celebrate how nice they are to me, hope you all don't mind. also i am nearing the end of my recovery but i am still unwell, it's just some extra support from them that helps, if i was very unwell a lot of this stuff would anger me and wouldn't help. please bare that in mind. 1 kinda obvious, no diet talk, no food talk, no fitness talk. don't talk about steps, c lories, nutrition and so on. it's not helpful and will make them very uncomfortable. casual conversation like i want to go to the gym to get stronger is ok, but things like i wanna lose weight aren't ok. 2 when taking them out to restaurants avoid all vegan and veggies places as many use those lifestyles to restrict. also in the uk since the new c lorie rule on menu, try for small local business to avoid this or look online or ask in the restaurant for calorie free menus. if you're in a situation where youve got to have a menu with c lories, offer to read out the menu or take a photo of the menu with the information covered. if the company has less than 25 employees they don't have to show the information 3 use a sharpie to remove nutritional information from food you buy, or remove the packaging. multipacks are good as the individual pieces inside don't have any of this info most the time. also it's worth carrying one around. 4 positive reinforcement of good actions. don't go over the top and wait until they've fully finished what they're doing and out of the situation else it might be triggering. simple things like i'm proud of you, you've done really well and well done are great to hear. 5 ask how to support them in times of distress when you're with them. my partner will lie on top of me and cuddle me when i feel bad after eating. its the most kind and amazing thing they do, and everytime they do it, it helps so much. when you're doing what you're doing for them, focus on calming, distraction and comfort. don't talk about what's wrong, it'll make it worse as it can retrigger someone. 6 when youre not with them and you're texting, unless you feel overwhelmed, just listen to them vent. sometimes all someone needs is to tell someone the thoughts in their head, have some reassurance or just be listened to and it helps a lot. but put yourself first, if you can't cope, let them know it's a bad time. 7 set an example. anaylis your relationship with food. do you restrict, do you have a bad relationship with food. if yes, work on that immediately and do not show that to them. i find copying what my partner eats and dos a really helpful way to improve myself. if theyre getting an ice cream i'll get it. if they're eating a challenge food of mine i'll ask to eat a bit of theirs or get my own. if they're not exercising today, then i don't need to ever. all you need to do is eat like normal basically. 8 gently encourage three snacks and three meals. just question them around those times of day. have had youre snack yet? are you hungry? do you wanna get some food? x looks good, we should get some. don't force it, don't be relate it to recovery, just know what they need to eat and generally encourage it 9 know when it's too much. you are the most important person to you, if you aren't coping with them being unwell, then get support yourself or leave. if you take anything away from this post, it's that you can not fix them. you can't take away their suffering. you can't make them recover. anorexia will turn them into a vile person when challenged. if you can't cope with being around their illness, leave. when dating a person with an ed, you can't ignore it or pretend it doesn't exist, and asking them to hide it or keep it away from you is dangerous for them. there's no shame in saying you can't cope, it's better for both of you to be honest and open. i can't be bothered to write full paragraphs about this but here's the rest of it. no weight related complements. don't tell them they're skinny and don't tell them they're not fat, it's what the ed wants to hear. tell them they're pretty, have a lovely body or you wouldn't change anything about them only say that if they're weight restored and don't need to gain more. cook meals with them and do food shopping with them. very good if you're at uni with ur partner. call out ed behaviour when you see it but be kind and gentle. prepare for lying and anger, if you get this, don't push them, just leave it. hope this helps people : ",

"dating leading to a big step in recovery. i have already started taking small steps in recovery by hiring a therapist and coming clean about my anorexia however, i've met someone special who happens to be a personal trainer. last night, i accepted his offer to create a strength training plan for me which consists of 4 days week in the gym. the goal is to build muscle and shape which as we know, must incorporate more food. i am a previous d1 athlete, so i am not anxious about the workouts but i know i need to fuel properly to get results and make it through each workout. i've started my day by adding collagen to my coffee 1 g protein and will meal prep my supper shortly. i know this will be extremely challenging and difficult as my ed voice will continue, but i'm also excited for new beginnings. my hope is to enjoy cooking and eating again as i used to. i am grateful for this safe space to share my thoughts and journey xo",

"sex as a coping mechanism. this might sound weird, but sometimes i use sexual stuff to cope with my ed. because if i can't get pleasure from eating or enjoy food as much as other people are able to, then at least i can get pleasure from that. and it can also distract me from the pain and hunger as well. and yes, my sex drive is quite low a lot of the time, but once i get into it, it's really nice regardless. it feels a little embarrassing to talk about, but it's just something that helps me.",
has therapy helped for anyone?. like sure he helps me connect the dots and theorize about why i am this messed up now but . okay now what???? fix meeeeee i just go in there and tell him how i m getting scared bc i feel myself getting worse but also it feels good and he just looks at me with a concerned face and nods okkaaaaaaayyyyy now what or like he wants me to get my primary care physician involved and a psychiatrist but all they re gonna do is tell me to eat and i can t do that rn and it would just be too much to deal with and feels like an overreaction bc i m physically fine still. anyways does therapy help anyone bc idk what i expect him to do but i wish he could do more,
"still hungry feels like the switch is broken, anyone else experience this?. tw suicdl it's been 5 years since starting recovery, there was a relapse maybe 2 years later and since then i would say i've been much more purge like. since the last relapse i have become a lot less restrictive,; i lost control to it i started losing my hair and started drinking alcohol and then just started binging and since then have really struggled to eat right. i never feel full even when i'm in physical pain i still don't feel full, equally when i don't eat for a long time i will feel weak but not actually hungry, and then i'll start feeling that familiar evil high and feel scared, like there's a murder in the backseat while i'm driving. i've been struggling with drinking and drugs, and the effect they have over appetite and the laxative effects. even though i'm definitely a healthy weight i still feel famished, and so tired and dirty. i'm actually now more on the heavy side, with high bp. some negative sexual experiences and the guilt of yoyoing has plunged my into another binge and into isolation in my home. in the past 2 years my weight has gone up and down drastically i'm scared my physical health can't take it but mentally i'm having very bad ideation thoughts as i fear the damage i keep doing to my body and the struggle to actually live a real life. 5 years ago it nearly killed me, it's killed my love life, life feels meaningless and like i'm failing when i'm not starving or living by food rules. i'm binging a bit but i can feel my anger rising and that i know it's one way or the other. i have no control over my relationship with food i'm either starving or binging i'm so exhausted from being this way all my life, all i think about is food my body and how much i hate them both. side note my mum knows how much pain i go through especially when binging and i've seen her take joy in it, joy in my weight yoyoing my dad is similar and it breaks my heart. these yoyo periods are damaging my bones, heart and making me suicidal and they seem to find it amusing. sorry went on a tangent... does anybody else find their sense of hunger is totally off. like hunger isn't a feeling but more a thought? i don't even know how to describe it. sorry if i've gone on a bit, if i could give it a second flair it would be rant. thank you for reading.",

"tw: i m relapsing after gaining a lot in just two week, and i don t know how to cope . tw: mentions of weight gain relapse and restrictive behavior the outpatient clinic i go to have been closed since it s summer vacation. i usually get weighted once a week by my therapist, and it s always the same scale that is being used. i ve been getting weighed every week since late fall last year. and i ve been in and out of recovery. however, i ve relapsed quite badly now. i decided to weigh myself on monday and today. and in just under two weeks, i ve gained almost 9 lbs. this has sent me into full panic mode, because i don t realize why i ve gained that amount of weight in a short period of time. i wasn t even underweight two weeks ago, which makes the weight gain so much harder to deal with. also, for the past two weeks i haven t been eating according to my meal plan, and i ve been walking 1 15k steps every day. that s why i don t understand how i ve gained so much weight. i have thrown out almost every single item of food from my freezer, refrigerator and cupboards, and i ve decided to eat as little as possible until the outpatient facility opens again. hopefully i ll get some weight of before i m seeing my therapist again. i fear that i won t be able to lose any weight, and that i m just going to continue gaining and gaining no matter what. i don t believe that this relapse is going to make me lose a lot of weight, and i certainly don t believe that i ll be able to become underweight again. but how do i prevent myself from getting to that stage when i m already so determined to lose the weight i ve gained? i feel disgusted when i look at myself in the mirror, i can both feel and see how much my body has changed in just two weeks .",

"therapist basically said i m not anorexic and i m fine. the session went for a dark turn. it was great up until he started talking about how when he first started working with me, he thought i was going to be on the verge of hospitalization and anorexic but the more he looked at the dsm, he realized that i m fine. my heart sank and i told him well that is exactly the problem, i told him how much that triggered me. how thats the problem with diagnosis and that s basically why i want to get to a very underweight weight. told him how i wear baggy clothes in our sessions which are virtual so he can t see my body. i told him i might not be very underweight but i might be on the cusp of underweight and now it s just reinforced me to want to lose more fat. the obsession and compulsion is already there, so now it s just even stronger. our session was longer than usual because i could tell he was worried about me and he said i m sorry if i triggered you, you going to be okay? he said i could email him if i needed to process anything. he s a great therapist but i really just think he didn t think what he said would trigger me like that. i straight up told him yea, this is why my ed is still here and alive. maybe if i lost 15 lbs then maybe my mom would be concerned or maybe people would take me seriously and be worried. but since i look fine and healthy and muscular, i guess it s fine. i can keep starving myself and keep trying to lose weight so i m legitimately underweight. i m so upset",
recovery makes things worse?. i am a 14 year old girl who s recently been diagnosed with an eating disorder . i ve just been forced into fbt and made to stop weight gain even though i am not classed as under weight. the people at the eating disorder clinic seem to be avoiding giving me a real diagnosis however are forcing me to recover. witch i know i cannot to right now. why?,
"i thought i developed my old anorexia into a bulimia but i think im still anorexic. someone tell me..?. my old 2 years of anorexia, i never once binged. ever. even overeaten. i was always restricting and over exercising. then i got into my binge eating disorder for about 7 months. after i started purging everything which is bulimic but when i don t binge i d eat something even tho it was still not normal eating. and now i binge and purge almost daily but after that, i eat nothing at all. i restrict liquids and water too. except the time i b p, i consume absolutely nothing except nicotine. i usually fast for min 16hrs to 5 hrs. then i b p again then fast and repeat. someone said if u restrict more than you consume by binging its anorexia with b p. im not sure if im anorexic anymore tho because of the first 2yrs of my ed where i never ever ate til i felt full. my head hurts lol",
"i don't want to open up about my eating disorder to my loved ones. i'm just not comfortable with it. every time they ask me questions they end up saying something extremely triggering or borderline offensive and it becomes a literal job or a task to communicate regarding my ed. they also then said that ""every time i try to ask you stuff you just push me away"" and it's like...yeah i do that because i don't wanna hear ""why don't you just stop starving it's not good for you"" for the millionth time it's exhausting having to communicate and it's even more tiring when they get mad at me for not opening up. i genuinely don't have the patience in me to talk to them about this even tho i went into detail like 5 times already in the past month of so and every single time i get so fucking disoriented and appalled. i feel guilty because they just wanna know about it but they're pushing recovery on me as well and getting upset when i'm unable to go through it. i hate this because i love them but they're so fucking irritating. im genuinely becoming such an insufferable person because of my eating disorder it's not fair to the people i love.",
"nausea never went away. 5 6 years ago i was around 13 i was depressed and completely lost my appetite. i was already small and lost a lot of weight making me severely underweight. i was put on a medication to help my appetite and was told to essentially double what my food intake. but my appetite was low and i ate what my body told me to, so i was nauseous eating more and sometimes vomited. still today if i think about food that doesn t intrigue i get nauseous. if i eat too much i get nauseous. if i haven t eaten i feel nauseous. recently i ve lost my appetite and i ve had trouble regaining it when i feel sick and sometimes even throw up around eating. now i m slowly losing weight. has anyone else who ate so much food to the point of vomiting deals with nausea years later and what do you recommend? thanks ",
"is it just me or is being called fat more hurtful when people knew you as thin?. recovered and it all went downhill from there. i have very limited resources and since i was expelled from university, i no longer had insurance so i was on my own. my anorexia probably morphed into binge eating sometimes with laxative abuse, but i think i'm more of a binger than a bulimic . my sister had a baby shower for their beautiful baby girl. everyone there almost did not recognise me. i don't think i would have minded being told i became thick or look healthy, but people were outright rude to me. my grandma was like 'you went from makes a stick figure gesture to that makes a fat person gesture in no time wow.' i felt humiliated and judged by everyone there and i didn't see my family or leave my room since. i've been triggered and i don't know how to handle my emotions without restriction. not that i'll be able to restrict because i completely lost my willpower too. like, the painful thing is that people see me as genuinely fat, not just thick or healthy. it's my own fault for indulging into this reactive hunger and making myself overweight. i'm sad.",
"im a disappointment and i don t know what else to do.. ive just come to the realisation that im a horrible fucking person and even though im over a year sober now i think im just going to starve myself again. it s easier, i won t have to spend any more money, it ll help the animals or whatever, and a while ago my neighbour agreed to take care of my dog if and when i pass away before him so i don t really see the problem with it but my friends are upset about it and i don t think they understand. im stupid and if i could say the r slur here to describe myself as well id definitely also say that. point is i just don t think i deserve anything. i don t want to take food away from people who really need it but i don t know how to keep people from noticing, especially since i live with other people. my only other worry is that im friends with some of the animals at my local zoo and im afraid they ll wonder where i went or why i look different since i visit them often. will they notice?? am i putting too much faith in them?",

"reaching my low weight didn't give me the rush i thought i would get. it lasted for about a day but i immediately fell into a depressive slump. i'm starting to feel like this disorder isn't worth it anymore and i just wasted like 5 years of my life for nothing. only 2 people commented on my weightloss and no one is especially concerned or loves me more like i thought would happen. i also still feel fat and feel like i need to lose more despite being barely in the severely underweight range. i'm generally not interested in anything, im pissed off, i'm keeping myself devoid of a healthy life and mind and i have constant brain fog. all of which i was prepared for and had been dealing with for a while but it doesn't feel worth it to me. i don't feel the euphoric rush i was told i would feel, mostly by my own brain. i'm genuinely miserable and realizing it for the first time in this time i've had my eating disorder. it's still comforting to me but only because it's familiar. im still possessive over my ed though despite feeling it's misery to the full extent.",
"does anyone else have no sex drive even after recovery?. my eating disorder started at a young age around 14 15 y.o and i have never been sexually active or desired to have sex. maybe i m just asexual because even after i began recovering 2 years ago, i am now 19 and have no sex drive whatsoever.",
"i should be scared that i m getting worse, but it feels good?. i know that s the twistedness of this disorder, but what in the world it s actually getting harder to eat even when i know i d still be in a big deficit if i ate more, it just never feels worth it , and i say actually in all caps because usually it s more of an effort to restrict if that makes sense? like of course normally i always would love to eat more or even binge bc i m hungry duh but then thinking about the dread and anxiety of the aftermath makes me not do it, but lately the thought of eating more is only and immediately terrifying and full of dread that it kills the urge altogether. there was a part of my brain that was afraid that i felt myself getting worse not long ago, but now that part is getting quieter. i feel like i should be terrified of where i ve gotten to and where i m headed but it feels good and my constant lightheadedness disassociation numbs out some of my intense ass social anxiety and anxiety of being perceived at all, and it even feels euphoric at times. i m almost proud that i ve gotten here, bc normally it made me jealous to read about how people just cant eat more bc i always felt like i could i just forced myself not to. part of my brain is definitely scared right now, but it s quieter. i just felt like i needed to share, thanks for reading if u did.",
went on a week spree of eating normally or extra but also a lot more exercise and i m worried that when i get home i ll weigh too much.. i work at a summer camp which provides meals and i ve been eating a full meal every day and often going up for seconds. someone made a comment that i m lighter than someone next to me who is only just slightly shorter and i m worried that i gained too much weight. what do i do,

"prolonged gi issues after anorexia recovery?. hi all this is the first time i ve ever posted in this sub in the hopes that maybe some others have had similar experiences. i ve been physically recovered from anorexia for about 8 9 years now, but i ve pretty much always had gi issues following my recovery. at first i thought it was just a normal response to my body trying to function normally again after the damage i had done to it, but i ve continued to have pretty severe bouts of gi problems even now when i ve been physically healthy for an extended period of time. mainly i m constantly gassy after eating burping a lot after every meal, pretty severe bloating and i ve had a consistent problem with constipation regardless of my diet exercise levels. recently i ve been going 1 12 days without having a bowel movement which is obviously extremely uncomfortable and the only thing that really helps is laxatives at that point, which i hate taking because of how rough they are on your stomach. i ve been to primary care doctor and my labs have come back normal no issues with my thyroid is what they were mainly considering and i still have no answers. since i ve been dealing with these issues for so long i m kind of used to it but at the same time, if it s something i can fix, i would love to be able to live more comfortably. the only explanation that i can think of at this point since a lot of these issues first began when i was in recovery is that all of my gi issues are related to what i did to my body when i was at my sickest. so my question to you all is: has anyone else had a similar experience?",
binging in recovery. heyy i m truly confused about this. i don t recognise when i m hungry or not and what is physical and mental hunger. i ve read some posts that some people in recovery slipped to binge eating disorder and i m scared that s my case too. i m trying to eat more during the day but it s really hard and i don t have time for that so i end up eating more in the afternoon. but the problem is night eating. i have the mental urge to overeat at night. some days i just binge a lot. do you have the same experience with this and if yes what helped you? is this due to the restriction that i m not eating enough during the day? im really scared because i want to be at peace with food and not to develop another disorder. side note: i also think that i m still not weight restored and i should gain more weight cause i still haven t got my period back.,

"ahh fuck it. i just realized why im not fucking happy, and im not going to be happy. my survival skills are worse than a fucking 5 year old. a 5 year old would get themself some chips, or cereal, and move on with their life. i waste thousands of calories of resources basically fucking gargling my food, food that many people aren't lucky enough to have, but i waste because im so fucking pathetic, and for what? does it make me happy to purge? no. does it make me happy to starve? no. does it make me happy to lose weight? no, it fucking doesnt. this fucking bullshit doesnt make me happy. the only thing that makes me happy now is being high as fuck. i am never going to be happy again with myself. not like this. it just isn't fucking possible. my brain is a delicate machine, and i threw a fucking wrench into it, i haven't bothered putting fuel in it for years, and now i expect it to produce the right chemicals? and every day i go to therapy and complain about it. there is a reason im not fucking happy. i keep wondering why it isn't working, when it is me that keeps denying my brain the fuel that it desperately needs, that it has been screaming at me to get. and i complain about it all the fucking time, when it is my fault entirely. it is me that keeps fucking gargling the fuel that would actually make me happy. how stupid can i actually fucking be? the world is an amazing place, and i have wasted all my time that i could be seeing it gargling my food. fuck this. fuck it. this isn't making me fucking happy, it's fucking boring, and fucking pathetic. this isn't doing anything for me and i need to shut the fuck up and just fucking eat instead of whine and complain about being sad, when i could easily get rid of all my problems by just nourishing my body. amp; x2 b; i need to just recover.",

"worried about a friend, need advice. i ve never visited this subreddit so please tell me if i don t comply to rules or anything. i have a good friend who used to be very overweight and unhealthy. smoked and drank every day, never exercised, ate almost exclusively fastfood. i just saw in the rules i can't post weights but he was very heavy. one day he decided this was not the life he wanted and started to get his live around. stopped smoking, barely drank any alcohol. walked about many kilometers every day for a year and about a year later started running. very strict dietary intake. lost a great amount of weight, but it did come with a few downsides. he s very focused on keeping control of everything in his life. he often cancels social events last minutes because they can cost him a lot of energy. when he does go they can tire him out for a week straight. recently he told his girlfriend who s very supportive that if we keep this up for another year we ll be slim finally the thing is, he already lost like xx kg in the last two years. he is slim. this and his extreme control of his dietary intake has led me to believe he might be or become anorexic. i find it hard to tell if i m maybe overreacting but i do think his view on his body is a distorted perception of weight. can anyone clarify me on what i should think of the situation and wether i m overreacting? also in any case, what s something i can do to help him? i do want to support him in his healthy lifestyle but i know his mental health is deteriorating as a result of his extreme need for control. thanks for reading ",

"how does everyone handle this?. tw can be very long so for a little back story, i ve been suffering from anorexia for a year now self diagnosed tho and i ve lost a considerable amount actually a lot of weight in this time and i m currently still under restriction and underweight. so one thing i ve experienced is that people not complimenting me but rather complaining that i look sick and skeletony. initially when i was at a borderline healthy weight, i used to get complimented for being fit that was also when i over exercised . but now every time i meet someone i know, all they say is that i look sick, starving, skinny and skeletony in a ugly way . they make fun of me for not eating passing comments like, right, you won t eat right? and they also compare me with my past self when i was chubby and a bit fat and say things like, you used to be so plump and chunky or what, are you on a diet and not eating so you could lose weight? . these comments just hurt and trigger me so badly. i get so angry but all i could do is just put on a smile and not say anything. ive started to hate going out and meeting anyone bc everyone comes back to that. i used to love going to my grandparents and cousins places but now i totally loathe it because they keep judging me also bc they try to stuff me with loads of food . ik i cant expect them to understand what im going through but they can atleast leave me alone right? and my parents do this as well, and this always starts fights at home. does anyone have this happening to them? can someone tell me how to handle this? i appreciate any help : ",

"does this sound like anorexia ?. i am going to approach this question differently that i normally do just to make it seem more sensical i have never been comfortable with my body shape , nor the number on the scale i fear gaining weight i tweak my food intake to keep things in check , but do not constantly restrict i find the sense of control gratifying i stress eat , and when i say this it is not necessarily a high amount of food , but rather extremely unhealthy that is a decent outline of what is going on , does this look like a relapse of sorts ?",

"relationship and anorexia. my girlfriend or now ex girlfriend has anorexia. i had a job where i was almost not home for 1 year and when i came back i sensed that she might have problems eating and finally she admitted that she suffers from anorexia. my sister has bulimia so i know a little bit how to handle it. but i was also very afraid, because i know that anorexia is very dictating and i made the experience that to defend themselfes they are sometimes very mean to you. my ex gf suffered bad depressions for ca half a year when i worked outside and when i came back until now. after i came back and i tried everything to help her. leaving her privatesspace if she needs or be there for here. i talked a lot with her when she was able to open herself she had so much insights. but all this openess would go away after a frw days....then depression kicks in again and ""everything is my fault"" and im ""the asshole that doesnt treats her right""....shes a little princess too...and that was always okay for me....but for example she never cleaned the flat....but when i talked with her about this she becomes angry and its not possible to talk about the subject because it becomes personal very quick, she also beat me a few times. first time she beat me i tried to calm her down without effect....and them i had to nail here on the ground because she wouldnt stop....i didnt beat back or anything i just took her to the ground so she cant beat me anymore. after that she said she couldnt trust me anymore because i nailed her to the ground and that she saw something in my eyes that shes afraid of now that i could harm her. i know that she knows thats bs...and after a few days all of this was forgotten. when i wanted to talk to her about the incidence she again said its all my fault and then she gets personal and then the talk is over.....after a long time trying, i couldnt talk to her like before when it comes to for example cleaning. my voice became more stressed and demanding and all this made it worse. but i tried it a long time diplomatic, talk normal to her and i just cleaned then. these are all just a few examples ive been together with her for 2,5 years now......and i managed to get her in a clinic 2 weeks ago week. its where she goes during the day and comes back in the evening. last week she just broke up with me because we had an argument and then she said ""that its my fault that shes not feeling good and that she has no energy for this"". she moved out the next day and cancelled our flat. shes ignoring my messages and if she answers she just says thats shes done and that she doesnt wants to be together with me anymore. her mother and sister has borderline and she acts kinda like them right now. in their family its always the fault of the other. they are very rich and she barely ever said thank you or sorry for anything. like there are not much insights of her own behaviour. why am i writing this here? i thought maybe you can help me to understand her. i leave her alone and dont message her anymore...i would move on if she wants it, but if she just needs time id give her the time. i feeld bad for her too and i want her to become healthy and happy....and if i cant help her with this im the wrong person....but fo you think there are any chances that she will come back? do you think its just a phase? im not sure if i can handle all this anymore as well and maybe its better now how it is....but i love her. when she has her open phase shes just adorable and lovely with so much empathy....but then its gone after a short amount a time. i hope that i didnt offend anybody here and i hope you dont think im just an idiot that doesnt try to understand anorexia. thats why im writing here. to understand. thanks for listening.",

doctor appointment and idk if i should mention my ed.. in a couple of days im going to have a check up with a doctor and i dont know if i should mention my struggles with food. i've never been diagnosed with an ed but have alot of the same problems as those who have it. should i tell me doctor about this even tho im already in some way trying to recover by myself. is there even i point in telling her if im trying to get better without anyone else.,
"it s never enough. it doesn t matter how much i restrict i m always fat. my waist will never be small enough, my weight will never be low enough, my thigh gap will never be big enough. i will always hate myself. nothing is ever enough. i wish my brain was kinder to me.",
"help me fix my mindset. i am being forced to have a bunch of fortisips in inpatient treatment and have developed severe behaviours to try and prevent myself from gaining weight on them. the only issue is that the staff on my unit know what i m doing and won t give me more food until i stop the behaviours. the problem is i feel like gaining weight on replacement drinks and not real food is such a waste and i have convinced myself that if i don t engage in these behaviours i ll gain a whole bunch of weight. how do i either convince myself that gaining weight in this way isn t a waste or that not doing these behaviours won t have any impact on my weight? honestly, i m probably only avoiding a couple of millilitres per drink, which realistically wouldn t be more than 2 3 calories per day. i m just terrified of gaining weight on replacement drinks. any advice help would really be appreciated.",

"i just need to vent. hi, i made this account just to vent, so i might not log back in but i can t say this to anyone. i ve struggled with my weight ever since november 2 2 because i became depressed my mother died after being bed bound for 6 years and i was struggling with my sexuality amp; religion and started binge eating to cope with it all. it didn t catch up with me until july 2 21. i didn t really do anything to slim down until i went to a vacation to nyc in december 2 21, and i saw how the pictures came out. i felt disgusted by the way my body looked, it was just horrible to look at. i then started to slim down and i felt great. i was slimmer and just all around healthier. but i always had a feeling like it wasn t enough, that my sister who recovered from anorexia but was still skinny , that she was just better and prettier than me. along with other things in my life, this made me realize that i have no control over goddamn anything. i also have low self esteem so i naturally just want validation from anyone. so ever since the start of june 2 22, i ve been restricting myself. not starving, but just making sure it s just under a certain amount of calories, exercising every chance i can, and making sure that i m loosing enough weight to meet my goal. i feel like i m obsessing now, like food is the main factor in my life and if i look ugly than i m fucking worthless. half of me thinks that i m being ridiculous but i can t look at food anymore without think of the scale going up. hell, part of me thinks i m just faking because i want to suffer for no reason. i don t know what to do; i can t tell anyone because i ve been put in a mental hospital before and i promised myself i will never go back there, but also i don t want to ever put my family through another thing again. also, i don t want to gain weight, i m not even underweight so it s pointless. but it s a burden to obsessively count your calories, constantly think about what low calories thing can you eat and yet also be the happy girl in the family, it s fucking exhausting. i can t tell this to anyone but i need to get this out. thank you for listening reddit. vp",

"how to get energy back after being sick?. possible tw. so about a week ago last wednesday , i woke up really sick with the flu. i tried to work out the first day, as i thought it was just allergies but then took a few days off as the illness progressed. it honestly wiped me out so much, with body aches, dizziness, and nausea. complete weakness, too. like walking from my bedroom to the bathroom was draining and left me out of breath still kind of does . i started trying to go back to the gym on monday but have not had any improvement in my energy levels. i find myself dreading going in because i feel so weak and drained, and working out with a mask on only makes the dizziness worse. however, the idea thought of missing any more time working out freaks me out. i'm already so upset with myself for skipping most of the weekend. i just don't know how to get the energy back. i feel so drained. even just light stretching and walking is difficult. and any time i have tried to go into the store to walk or move around more, i feel like i should have taken one of those motorized carts. does anyone have any suggestions on how to gain some energy back? not only for the gym but just to function more in general, too. like i said, even walking to the bathroom can be so tiring right now, even though it's been a week. i will note that i did take two covid tests, a couple of days apart, and both were negative. so it isn't that. i still have been wearing a mask in public places just so i don't spread germs even more. i hope this doesn't go against guidelines and i am sorry if it does. posted in another forum and it was deleted.",

"what could someone say to push you to recovery?. i ve seen an influx of how can i support this person help push them to get better posts, and it got me curious. tw because of personal experience ?? after moving out at 18, then returning home at 2 for a brief period, i went from obese to underweight in the last six or so months before i moved back home. after about a month, my father looked at me with the most dreadful, sorrowful look in his eyes. when i asked him what was wrong, he replied you re just so skinny now. you look sick . it was such a wake up call. i felt like a glass mirror had been shattered, and for the first time in over six months, i really looked at myself. i had been losing hair like mad, had been having horrible horrible headaches for months, i was incredibly weak etc etc. after he said that, i looked in the mirror and truly didn t even recognize myself. i was appalled at the shadow of a person that existed in my reflection. although i d obviously heard of ed s before, i had never considered myself to be suffering from one after much education and self reflection, i realized i d been struggling with disordered eating since about 3rd grade anyways, after i had that stream of realizations, i restored myself to a healthy weight and began going to the gym again. i very much still struggle, but i know that, at the very least, i ll never allow myself to get to that point again. and i know a lot of people will think my father was harsh, or being mean, but it truly was helpful for me. so i m curious about what things someone may have said, or how someone may have acted, to really want to make you recover. even if it was only 1 seconds of wanting to recover, what were some things that moved your heart?",

"advice for a sister?. my little sister 16 is struggling with anorexia nervosa for the last 2 3 months she s been in and out of hospital, and is now on antidepressants but still really struggling and waiting for a bed on an inpatient psychiatric ward. all the way through her treatment so far i ve helped with meal times, emotional support, and being there for her, as i have a better understanding of eds than our parents did at the start of all this. i 19, female have struggled with depression, anxiety and ptsd for around 6 years now, and watching her struggling like this is really setting me back in my own recovery, because i m struggling to make time for myself and my own self care because i m so worried about her all the time. when i was severely ill in the past she was one of the only things that kept me going, she s my best friend and i don t know how to cope with not being able to help her. so now to my question will she feel like i m abandoning her if i take a step back and let my parents take charge now that they re more educated on how to help her? i don t want her to feel like i don t care about her, but i m also worried about how unwell i m making myself by dedicating all my energy to her? thanks xx",

how does long term underweight affect genes?. when i was a baby i had black hair. a few months after my birth my hair became light brown red. after some time my hair would become darker. at the age of 4 5 or maybe even earlier my hair was very dark brown almost black. i am 29 years old male and i have anorexia nervosa for 8 years. i wasn t able to give my body the nutrients it needed. and i noticed a lot of weird changes in my body. i read that long term underweight can affect your genes. i am very scared about this. a few weeks ago i noticed that my hair becomes red light brown again. my cognition also changed and i feel like i am a child again. it feels like the time again when i had some real struggles with listening to people and remembering things. i noticed that these weaknesses and issues come back the longer my underweight anorexia nervosa lasts. is it possible that things will become good again? will i be able to understand irony again once i gain weight again? will my hair become dark brown again? is it possible that due to malnourishment my genes changed? and will my genes switch again once i gain weight and hold that weight for a long period of time? i am kinda hopeless. i don t feel like 29. more like 8 . underweight speeds up aging. i saw a video on youtube of a dog that was treated very badly by his owners. he didn t get food and lost a lot of weight. there was nothing left but bones and skin. he was very thin. you could see his sickness in his eyes. he looked way older than he actually was. his eyes looked like death. his new owners treated him better by giving him food and attention. he is in a good place now and reached a healthy weight. even tho he made all this success thanks to his owners you can still see that there is a difference between him and other dogs who have not suffered like he did. his eyes lost their glance and kept this tiredness. and i am scared about this. will there always be a scar even tho i manage to heal my anorexia underweight?,

"my ed is ruining my life.. hey everyone. i have been battling with my ed for almost years now and i'm getting so tired of it. i lost quite a bit of weight in a couple months then binged for months, everyday, without fail and gained so much more weight back, i am so sick of this cycle. i feel like i'm so invalid and disgusting. i hate myself so much and i feel like i'll never be good enough for anybody. i've lost basically all of my relationships and close friends due to my mental health. i'm at the point where i don't even enjoy food anymore, it feels like a chore. i can't go a minute without thinking about all the numbers and bc in every mirror i see. i know i'm skinny average but i still feel huge. i feel like i'll never be 'skinny enough' or perfect. i don't know what to do. i have ruined my relationship with food and its took a toll on my relationship with my family. i can't eat the same meals as them, i can't go out and eat with them and i always get angry at them for trying to help. i don't enjoy anything anymore. i stay inside all day, i rarely leave my room, i have no friends, no life, no feelings of happiness and i even took up smoking to suppress the hunger. my life is an absolute mess. it's like i'm going off the deep end and don't know how to stop. my health has started to take a toll and i've been feeling so sick because of my illness. i don't understand why people glamorise eds when this is the outcome, it's not fun and honestly scary. i still want to loose weight and be ""perfect"" but i also don't want to get sicker. i don't know what to do. i'm sorry for this random post, i just wanted to rant somewhere.",
"ed is a manipulative bitch. it s so sad. we all know it. makes you feel so save while destroying you from the inside out. creates walls between you and everyone you love. leads you down a path an never ending cycle. and when you try to break free, you feel so torn because you want to go back to your ed, even though you know it s the last thing you should do. i hate it. i hate it so much and at the same time i feel like loosing control if i let go. i need time and pause my life again. i put my loved ones through pain watching me again. and i am a total and utter mess again. i postpone to message my professor, that i can t come to class anymore cause of personal reasons. i know i have to pull back on classes or i will drown. but i am so so so so scared to be a failure. even though i am not. i put myself first which is a good thing. but my ed and my anxiety try to turn it around and use it against me. i just wanted to let that out. maybe i can write this email now.",
"does anybody else smoke cigarettes or vape because they think it will burn off calories?. i know smoking kills the feeling of hunger but i also read somewhere that it speeds up you metabolism. now i can t get that out of my head and every time i eat something doesn t matter what , i have to smoke to burn it off : anybody else with this problem? cause i feel like i m the only one, thank you x",
"parents do suck sometimes. im just venting, sorry bout that. so my lovely loving always wanting to help parents honestly told me to only have bread and water. like wtf? i get it i am fucking broke and it might not have been the greatest idea financally wise to get a dog. but they know i have been suicidal for years now amp; my baby boy brings soooooo much light, hope and joy in my life. it was the best decision ever anyways, he needs training and the vet aint cheap either. but i can do it. it just takes a little bit more time than it would if i were fucking rich or whatever. my parents dont need to worry about money. but i dont ask them for help, just for understanding. they still feel the need to say i should starve myself? while being anorexic? last inpatient treatment not that long ago? what the fuck is wrong with those people?",
"constipation and effects of a large bowel movement. had anyone had lots of negative effects from large painful bowel movements as a result of your malnutrition? this may be tmi but this morning i passed the largest hardest log and even hours and hours later, i ve been very nauseous in my head, and i had a headache, and some acid reflux, and just now i went pee and suddenly felt like i was going to have diarrhea, but there s nothing. i can t find any explanation for why pooping affects me so negatively, and it doesn t even make sense that this was a result of this morning, but things like this happen almost every time recently. any insights?",
"considering just a short recovery. i really want to do.. like a one week recovery by myself. i know it sounds strange, but i just feel like i'm definitely not ready for any real recovery. i just want to give my body a little break and let myself become healthier. i just want to value myself over my weight for once. and i want to accomplish this so i can feel proud of myself. it's just one week, anyway. or maybe a little over a week. but i feel so scared and guilty even thinking about it. my brain is like, ""wow, you're really coming up with any excuse you can to be lazy and just eat all day? do you realize that you're nowhere near underweight and you're disgusting and you will never ever deserve to recover?"" so, yeah.. i'm just so nervous about it, but i feel like it would be good for me, and also being physically healthier might help make my mind healthier too. i'm just so scared, but i really want to try just for a bit. i feel like i just need someone to tell me that my thoughts are wrong and i do deserve recovery.",
"brighter days ahead. hello all, so i found out about my anorexia about a month ago. my bf has showed concern about it for awhile now, but i always told him i m fine amp; i just can t eat a lot because i get full quick. i guess it s normal to be in denial about it for a couple years? anyways, i started php this week and i ve really been struggling with depression and anxiety. being there, i feel like i don t belong and find all these reasons why, but i have recently learned that i don t know shit about shit. i must have been really great at hiding it because everybody was kind of shocked when i told them i mean even myself , which then turns my thoughts to well they obviously don t pay enough attention to me or in other words, nobody cares. my bf and i constantly argue since being diagnosed. i tell him i appreciate his support and i understand he s scared, but the you need to eat more than that or pointing out my size really don t help. i feel bad since i can t help him understand any better and that there is so much to this. i don t really have a community that understands anything about this. i have no friends since i moved halfway across the country four months ago. i just feel so lonely and helpless. i am dedicated to getting healthy and doing whatever it takes to get there, but this ed comes with so many strings attached.",
"i miss actually wanting to eat. i remember when i was a kid being excited whenever i went to my great grandfather s because he would always have a lot of the best breakfast foods ready for me when i got there and he would always make me a root beer float it was so exciting for me. i can t remember the last time i considered breakfast food an option. if i eat it s late in the day just to tide me over until i sleep and as someone who s prescribed vyvanse after i take that in the morning i feel like i only need to eat like a granola bar. thinking about eating doesn t hurt as much anymore just because i now associate things i assume taste good with weight gain immediately and i know it s stupid but i think i m more likely to eat trash than food i used to love and i don t want to eat trash so i end up not eating. i don t really know where i was going with this but it sucks so much because now even if i try my best to recover i just feel so down the whole time and so disappointed and of course that s expected but it s been years of this and it s not just that i want to eat a whole plate of bacon or a syrup drenched cinnamon waffle, i want to want it again. sorry if this was all over the place just wanted to yell through my thumbs.",
missed period question. did anyone have any weird symptoms with their first missed period?,
"triggered by loneliness. this is one of the only triggers i can absolutely pinpoint. my partner has been having a depression spike and isolating in the bedroom. i usually sit out in the living room because laying in bed reminds me of all the years i spent doing that due to my own depression and ed. however, i am noticing that i feel more and more lonely, and it makes eating less appealing by the day. i don't like eating alone, and my ed has always been a way for me to externalize my feelings. i'm just so tired of feeling like i don't connect with anyone. like no one actually wants to be around me. they just happen to hang out with me. my ed has always been the one constant in my life and no matter how many people try to tell me that they'll be there, i know that they're wrong. my ed is the only ""friend"" that i have ever had.",
my ed is on and off. title says it all. sometimes my ed takes over and i heavily restrict and other times i binge for months. it makes me feel so invalid because it s like i have a bipolar ed. it s so strange because either or can come on so easily. is anyone else like this?,
"my mom told me not to eat and i've been triggered for the past hours. ugh she just drives me crazy sometimes, i swear. it literally took me so long to make the choice to eat and then it took me so long to actually try and even touch the stupid dish just for her to come to the kitchen and remind me that i shouldn't eat because i have to look well for work tomorrow. i'm so fucking tired of this. if it's not me telling myself that i don't have to eat it's my parents.",
"small changes towards recovery. i have been kind of considering taking steps to be healthier. so i was thinking that maybe this week starting on monday, i can try to drink any liquids besides water, like tea or vitamin water, whenever i skip a meal. so that even if i'm not eating... at least i'll be getting some extra fluids and electrolytes. does that sound like a good idea?",
"i broke up. but i still want to help her. any advice?. dear lovely people, i recently posted a vent where i stated to probably break up the relationship to the mother of my child. after a week of fighting i suddenly found peace and didn't blame her for anything. this is not her, this is her dark friend. and i figured that i have to look for myself and cannot change her. as we started dating, she was fine and we had great talks, emotions and a deep relationship. i even still consider her as my soulmate. we do not live together, but actually there was the plan to move together after long 3 years of relationship. we even don't live in the same city. so my plan for now is to move there, but i will take my own flat. yesterday i told her in a long respectful lovely friendly text message how i feel, that i don't blame her and that i am just tired now. and i stated, that i will visit her next week for a talk will be a break up talk . so she knows already what is about to happen has already happened. she is calm and understands my pov. i do still love her, but beeing with her is just too painful and exhausting. it isn't her fault, she just acts, as she ever does. generally i am very worried about her health. she is exzessively sportive, loves to eat as less as possible and so on. my door will always stay open for her, when she comes back from her journey. in the planed talk next week, i want to encourage her in changing, doing therapy, consult doctors and tell her that i will give support where possible. do you have any advice here? how can i convince her to change? as a reminder we have a kid together and i maybe must start some law anforcement in order to save my little son. but this is the last thing i want to do. she is still my best friend and i love her. best would be to ""wake her up"", gain her motivation, give her the vision of a safe family. thx 4 your input",
"boyfriend triggered me after months of not thinking about calories. im babysitting tonight from 5:3 ish until past midnight, which means obviously i had to have skipped dinner and waited until i was home to have dinner. it s about 4 hours in and i told him i was pretty hungry and might order some food; so i added items to my cart something i d usually get and sent a screenshot asking him what he thought. he said that s a lot of food. are you sure you can even finish that?? that s way too much . kind of sat there for a moment and tried not to tear up, because for me, being able to eat whatever i want whenever i want is such a huge recovery step, but this just triggered me so much i deleted the items in my cart as well as the app. the way he worded it made it seem like i was greedy for wanting to eat that much which was a cheeseburger and a pack of nuggets with chips?? . i feel stupid and hungry : ",

relapsing. i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself. why can't i just be okay and eat normally and not care so much. i don't think i'm ever going to leave this cycle and i'm so tired of it. i feel like i should just kill myself because i hate my body and i feel unlovable and idk. i hate this disorder so much but i always turn back to it. even when things are going okay for once. i just wish i could be happy and be okay?? why is it so hard : sorry.,

""you look better now you're nice and think, just like a model "", she said with a smile. that ""complement"" made me go even further. after less than a month, i lost more weight than i did in the previous three month. it was getting out of hand and i knew it. once again, i was forced to step on the scale. what it showed now shocked everyone. i was already very underweight. but it wasn't enough. i told myself i was fat and i would constantly look in the mirror and check my weight. soon, my mom caught up to what was going on. by then i already read some things about eds and anorexia nervosa, so i had a general idea of what was happening. however, her reaction was far from what i expected. instead of supporting me and seeking help, she said that i ""better start eating, or i'm going to take away all of the things you love until you return to normal"". i was shocked. i wished i could've just fallen through the ground right there and then. i lost all hope in ever getting better. i thought i was done. a few months had pased and i still wasn't getting better. my mom seemed to have forgotten or rather ignored what had happened. my mental health was getting worse, i started self harming and i became even more asocial than i was. i tried mentioning it again, or just hinting to the fact that i maybe had an ed. but nobody cared. the same things happened again. i'm too young to legally get help by myself in the country i live in, so i have to deal with everything alone. my friends have been forcing me to eat something recently and i'm recovering in terms of weight, even though i'm still underweight. i feel like relapsing, i feel invalid because my ed is not diagnosed and not ""severe enough"". but i feel that i need to talk to my parents so i can get help. but they keep telling me that i'm fine, i'm just ""bullsh tting"" or they just ignore it. i don't know what to do or how to tell them that i need help without them reacting the way they usually do. thank you for reading this post. if you have any advice, please comment or dm me if you're more comfortable with that. thank you once again and have a good day ",
"i can't do this anymore. i think i will brake up our relationship.. me and the ed mother 38 of my son 3 had a new fight these days. a fight like all others, that happened a lot in the last months. i tried to love for both of us, tried to remind her constantly about our relationship. we once loved each other. we were and maybe are still soulmates, but i think i lost contact with her. i gave her so many clear statements about my needs in this relationship and that i often don't feel loved. i asked her about her needs, but there is no answer. she admitted and promised to give more effort. sometimes she forgot our last talks and moved on as usual. and even worse, she recalls our issues, acknowledged my emotions, but she told me she is not able to work with me here, because she doesn't know how. i tried to comfort her, make her feel good and tried to be respectful at any time, knowing that it might not be her, but the ed. i allways had this little dream of a family with her, and she did too, at least verbally. i wanted to cure her, give her her love back, make her feel valuable again. but she is fading. the mother of my kid. she is a good mother. but an awful partner. she cannot feel any love for herself now, neither for me. and i am tired after so many years. i feel stupid and exploited. i have to take care for myself now, and certainly for my kid, but she has to go her way alone. i cannot help her, i never could. edit: she had her therapies, but broke all of them. atm the considers herself as healthy and sees no need for any medical advice.",

"ultimatum. don't know what to do... today i ate at a chinese buffet with my friends. my mom picked me up afterwards and we had an argument on our way home. she got angry at me for not making any progress, for not gaining any weight, for over exercising, for not looking into therapy hard enough and for lying to her about my over exercising. she said i'm gonna die if i don't start trying harder, that i look sick and that nobody wants to look like me. she said i enjoy being sick and that i enjoy being the victim and the center of attention, which couldn't be further from the truth. but she won't listen. i don't enjoy being like this. i hate being this way, yet it gives me comfort. i'm scared of letting go my disorder. i'm scared of gaining weight. i've been stepping out of my comfort zone and breaking my ed rules, slowly but surely. but it just isn't enough. i don't think i can do it without therapy. i've talked to some kind of school counselor therapist and i didn't feel like it helped at all. he made me feel like i'm not sick at all, like i'm choosing to be this way. and that made me feel so confused and upset. i don't know what to do or think anymore. my mom threatened to put me into a clinic. i'm afraid of losing my job and missing school and my daily life. most of all, i hate disappointing my mom. she thinks i'm hurting her on purpose. she must hate me right now. i hate myself.",

"what does recovery mean to you?. i ve noticed that the idea of recovery has a different meaning for everyone who struggles with an eating disorder. for some, it means they stop counting calories or maybe they overcome their binge restrict purge cycles. some people measure recovery by their ability to challenge fear foods or simply by making sure they achieve a healthy weight. for me, recovery would mean i stop comparing myself to others and being embarrassed about eating in public.",

"birth control weight gain and relapse. hey everyone i'm having the nexaplan fitted this thursday as i need to have it before i change my drugs epilepsy a couple of months ago my eating disorder got bad again and to the point i said fuck it i'm recovering well... that didn't go to plan. i was doing alright not weighing myself, not weighing food, not exercising everyday and i was beginning to feel more in control of food and a bit more confident in my body . however in may it got slowly worse and the bad habits kept coming back slowly i think it was triggered by the news of an old friends suicide which noone had told me about until i googled him . ever since my doctor told me that i had to go on nexaplan and told me the side effects and i found other people's experience on it learning about the weight gain has sent me down another little spiral. i'm not sure if i can take the weight gain if i have that side effect and i'm not sure how my eating disorder brain is going to cope... as of right now i do semi want to recover but i also know i'm slipping back into the habits again. this time around it's not just me who i'm hurting as my boyfriend has helped me try to recover and my parents are getting more and more suspicious my parents don't know and i was never officially diagnosed which makes me feel like a fraud especially as i haven't lost that much weight and feel like i'm awful at eating disorders if that makes sense sorry for the ramble and i'm not sure what i want to see as a reply i'm just not sure what to do as especially the week leading up to it i'm panicking and forgetting everything i've done trying to recover",
"atypical a stuck. i ve 18m been in recovery for a little over two years. at my lowest i wasn t never considered underweight for my height, so i was stuck with the label of atypical. this was incredibly invalidating to my struggle and has honestly stuck with me ever since. after two years of recovery i ve started to try to lose weight in a healthy way, as i m in an unhealthy range for my height and age. but i feel myself, even after this recovery, slipping back into old mindsets and habits. why is it so hard to kick these old thoughts? i have an incredible support system and a caring partner, although he seems pretty blind to my descent back into restrictive eating habits. does anyone else get hung up on these old thoughts when they try to lose weight a healthy way?",

"friend said i look healthy . now i just want to starve and lose xx. i saw a friend i haven t seen in months. she texted me after i left and said you look good you look healthy . and i said wow, that sucks lol, because in my mind healthy means fat, she s a life coach and knows about my ed . i told her i thought i lost weight but i guess not. then she replied, nooo you re lean as fuck. so which is it then? am i fat and healthy? or am i lean af? either way that just totally revved everything up. i ve already been fasting and restricting and working out, so i guess i ll just continue and try to lose as much weight as possible. even if i lost a few lbs, it doesn t matter because i look healthy still. i want to be underweight i m sick of being this weight and i want to get past this plataue. i m not in the recovery mindset, sorry guys. don t hate me. i just don t care anymore. i would rather lose weight and have a bigger cushion to work with so i don t have to worry about gaining a few lbs. i m just really in my ed right now and don t care. i wanna lose as much weight as physically possible",

is it normal to be discouraged from eating what you crave at inpatient centers?. my biggest struggle is letting myself enjoy what i eat or eat what i want. on one side they say it is ok to eat what i want and that i need to gain weight. on the ither i am not allowed to eat a cookie. stick to the meal plan oh yeah the meal plan that is more restrictive? psa. there are no medical reasons to forbid me.,

"i've been incredibly depressed and self destructive and now i fear i'm giving myself an ed. due to many, many circumstances, my life has gone to hell in the past year. i am currently living in my partners house with their mother and her boyfriend. i have always had trouble with food due to growing up poor. i had snacks during the day and then one proper hot microwave meal for dinner, i've lived this way since i can remember. since moving in with my partner suddenly after getting kicked out, my mental health has rapidly declined and i find myself self sabotaging and punishing myself. it has become frighteningly easy to stop eating. i feel like an inconvenience and like i don't have a right to eat their food because i don't contribute to buying it. my self destructive tendencies make it a vicious cycle where i fuck up something so i feel like shit and get angry at myself and so then i fuck shit up for myself and then i feel like shit and get angry at myself etc. these new eating habits have only gotten bad the last couple weeks. i know i have to stop before it gets bad but it is so tough, and it's getting worse because i now think about eating and get sick. i know that now i am at a cross roads and i need to stop this self destruction but i don't know how. if i could have any advice or help i would appreciate it immensely. thank you.",

"ng tube at home. dear redditors i have had an ed for a large amount of time by now, so long that i do not remember what it is like without one. i struggle with alternating long and painful episodes of binging and restriction, am currently in a restriction episode. i am not ready to recover yet but would like a way to sustain my mental and physical wellbeing that doesn't involve constantly obsessing over what i'm going to or have eaten. i have had an ng tube while in hospital, so i am not new to this. my treatment team, however, says ng tubes are for those in ip and i have made the decision that i can not go back as it was a traumatic experience for me personally to be there. does anyone have experience with using an ng tube at home? i am aware of the rule that nobody here can or should give medical advice, but those who are guiding me medically are not even open to the idea. thank you ",

"a win for me replacing an unhealthy an habit with a safer one in recovery. for a while i 'snacked' on gaviscon tablets, broke that habit a while ago but feeling like i need something to replace that habit while i'm recovering that isn't harmful, but will not send my ed brain wild losing its shit... which it already is because recovery lol i'm also vegan which makes this a bit harder but i just got a box of these 'mintastic' mints and i think they'll be great, they taste good esp. the sweet strawberry flavour. the polyol sweetener they use tends to make me gassy so i know i can't go overboard but i feel happy i've found something with a bit of crunch and flavour that i can nibble on throughout the day, that isn't a fucking gaviscon tablet lol. i'm on a harm reduction recovery journey at the moment, i've upped my intake like 2x and i was never a low restrictor and reducing my exercise by basically 1 so it's really difficult and my ed brain is going nuts constantly and i'm just trying not to overload myself with challenges basically i mean, eating 6x a day is already doing that lol so i guess finding something that feels safe feels reassuring, but there's a part of me that's like 'well it's not really recovery is it because you should be having like chocolate bars constantly not little mints' but then i think hey, i'm pushing so far through my comfort zone already and that's very distressing but also rewarding yay for being to focus for more than one minute on my work so maybe it's okay to do some of these harm reduction focussed things alongside the harder recovery work? it's not a black and white matter, recovery, i think it's a grey area and that's really hard for my an brain to understand... so yeah i'm not sure what i'm trying to say here perhaps trying to reassure myself and anyone else trying to recover that not every little snack or action you have or do needs to be some epic huge momentous challenge if you're already making big strides challenging your ed in recovery then it's completely ok to have some 'safe' things still in rotation, and if that stops you doing something unsafe e.g. eating a medicine tablet smfh at my old self then, all the better love and light to you all, recovery is hard. stay strong.",

horrible mind set. not sure but just in case tw not to read if vulnerable to adapting new ideas or habits so to put it simply i have started to eat more not because i want to recover from my ed but because it bothers my girlfriend and my mom i'm 16 . ik this doesn't sound right but its true and hey any reason to get better is better than none. but the truth is i don't want to recover and only get worse as my mind makes me believe that this is what i deserve or that it's good for me. ever since i started eating more i am terrified of gaining weight or looking bigger even more than before. so i came up with a long lasting plan not going into detail but main point of it is to wait to be alone to stop recovery once again. this exact plan is what's keeping me on track with recover most of the time knowing that i will be able to go back to all the bad habits later on without worrying people. ik this is unhealthy but it's the only thing keeping me going at the moment both with recovery and everyday life. i'm not to sure what to do as i can't tell anyone about this or my struggles with eating at the moment. the urge to relapse is getting stronger each day and knowing how precious relapses turned out for me this time it might lead me to a hospital or dead. if you read this sorry for taking your time i just needed to get this off my chest somewhere to someone that would understand me.,

"question about recovery in general. i think that a. is hard to overcome bcs. it serves as a problem solving mechanism which doesn't solve any problem but rather stands in the way of dealing with it. it more and more becomes a go to response to many problems and looses, over the course of decades maybe, its causal connection to the original problems. it therefore presents itself as a behavior which is intertvined existentially with the person. every try to overcome a. means a selfinflicted attack on ones selfimage or identity. therefore i think that neither psychoanalysis nor inpatient treatment the way i got to know it in germany are usually successfull in overcoming a. although i don't argue against either, especially in lifethreatening situations but rather keeep perpetuating it as it validates the identity psychoanalysis . i do believe the most promising avenue is to start behavioral therapy and treat causal problems secondarily. i am seeing that as beeing painted with a very broad brush, and in no way applicable to all people with a. as i am not afflicted myself but have decades of experience as a partner of someone with a., i would immensely appreciate your thoughts on this. won't be able to answer for a few hours though as it is already very late ",

i want to give up on recovery. tw sh tw recently i have decided to start recovering from starving myself and disordered eating haven't been diagnosed with an ed but i wouldn't be surprised if i had one . i didn't want to worry my girlfriend or my mother. they kept telling me how worried they are that im getting worse and ill end up in a hospital or dead if i wont stop starving myself. i've been eating more than i used to for the past 2 weeks feeling guilty everyday. now that i look at myself i feel like everyone was over reacting with my situation and that i wasn't bad at all and could keep going as i did which made the urge to start restricting again bigger. i don't like the fact that i feel hungry so often or that i'm not sick after a small meal. it just feels wrong to enjoy food or to actually let myself eat. and the fact that the guilt that i get after eating is getting smaller makes me feel like a failure and made me very sensitive easily upset . this has lead to me either wanting to over exercise but i'm unable to do so as i'm always tired no matter what i do or how long i sleep. it also made me consider sh which i tried just a few times multiple times a day to replace the emptiness and pain i felt when starving. i feel like restricting myself again would make everything easier and make me happier and stop the sh thoughts. just this time to be more secretive about it so the ones that care about me won't be worried anymore. i don't know what to do when i want both to recover and to get worse but i'm scared of gaining weight and don't want to worry anyone.,

"feeling hungry after eating in recovery. so i guess ive been in recovery for a while now and it wasnt really planned or anything but i just ended trying it because of exams that i didnt want to mess up. ive had a lot of slip ups but overall id say its much better from when i was heavily restricting, and i was just wondering why i feel hungry everytime after i eat but not so much before? some days i could go without feeling hungry at all the whole day and then other times i eat even if im not hungry and then start to feel hungry after. ik it may be messed up hunger signals but i thought these would have been fixed by now since its been quite a few months and all of the other symptoms are gone, google keeps saying there might not be enough protein etc in the meals but thats not whats wrong since i make sure theres everything: sorry for the rant its just been going on for a while now so i was wondering if anyone knew why this was: ",
"i don't have anorexia but idk i think i might be on the verge of it?. so i enjoy eating food it's kind of like a guilty pleasure of mine. but here recently i've noticed i've gained weight. when i look in the mirror all i see is my round belly and i'm disgusted by myself. i keep telling myself ""now today you're not going to eat anything because you need to lose weight"" but then i always end up eating because i have no self control. and since i didn't have control over my eating i go and cut myself. it's like this endless cycle of ""don't eat, eats and then cuts self"". i don't know how to stop it but i was actually able to go a day without eating and i felt super empowered like i had overcome and defeated some hard boss in a game. it was amazing feeling. of course i over ate the next day which completely ruined that euphoria. but i'm worried now since i made it through a day without eating, am i going to get worse? will i eventually go days without eating? or just eat barely anything each day? i honestly don't know what's worse starving and not cutting or being fat and cutting...",

"shame in recovery, 4th day of recovery. i have been put on a refeeding plan and while i see the need refeeding as in, the goal is not yet to gain weight but to slowly increase calories to a point where i can gain weight to not develop refeeding syndrome i have to be honest and say i sometimes or many times had slightly more than the plan alowed. by more than the plan alowed i mean liquid calories because i put milk into my tea. we have soy milk too and sometimes i took the vanilla or choco one which has sugar safety: i can t have to mych sugar . now i m feeling guilty because i went against the rules . while at home i always avoided sugar in milk and bought the sugar free option they don t have that here. my ed does not really care in itself but it cares because it thinks it has an extra reason to not allow me to have that milk. but also black tea with milk is such a comfort drink for me and i need that with everything else. i doubt it be too dangerous but yeah idk what do you guys think",
i need help. i m scared to gain weight again. about two years ago i stopped eating because my parents pushed dieting on me. i did loose weight but i was miserable. i still hate myself and i still felt like a fat kid. it took a long time to finally recover and i finally started eating a healthy amount again but i noticed i ve gained weight. i m still in high school and i really don t like how i was treated in middle school befor my ed so i m scared that if i gain weight people will treat me differently and i ll spiral back into anorexia. my parents consider my ed a success story and i feel like if i don t loose the weight i ll be a disappointment to them. please i just need some advice or motivation. i m scared and i don t want to go back to that dark place i was in.,
"i don't wanna recover, as sick as that sounds.. tw no matter how much i stare at myself in the mirror, no matter what my family says, no matter what my friends say; i'll always be fat. i wish that i could just stop eating. i've stopped before and have thrown up the food i have eaten, but it hurts so much to heal from that. i want it again so i don't feel fat. i want it again so people bully me for being too thin. i'd rather die than be fat. i want to starve again, but my family forces me to eat. now i can't stop. i hate the full feeling in my stomach. i just want it to be empty. i'm just going to give up and not eat. no matter how good food looks, i may just eat one meal, maybe even none. i'm so sick of the pain of being fat. i'm sick of my fat thighs, my weird bulging stomach, and my thick face. if anything, the impact of it is the only thing that has stopped me over the years. i'm just not going to eat anymore. i can't take it. i've been like this since i was 8. i'll never be the same again. i hate how i've recovered, so i'll start again. even if i'm eating small meals, that's better than big ones. i hate it so much. i just want to love myself. this is the only way.",

"feeling misunderstood. i realize being clinically underweight when you have an eating disorder is a triggering thing to talk about. if you make a post about being underweight, it can come off as triggering to others. a lot of times, i feel like i can't talk about it and express that being underweight is serious, without seeming ""fatphobic or triggering,"" because a lot of people with eating disorders are not even underweight and are a healthy weight and overweight. if you happen to fall into the underweight category, it seems you have to defend yourself, because eating disorders are competitive. so you don't seem like you are ""sicker or worse."" than people who are healthy weight and overweight. someone even accused me of ""being sicker than everyone else"" because of a post i made. i do not think like that in terms of my illness, and i never have. my underweight body is not an attempt to ""compete"" with others, it has nothing to do with other people, and it has nothing to do with a fear of being fat. i feel like i can't talk about harm reduction on other subs, because it triggers other people on the sub who are perhaps younger, just starting to recover and do not understand harm reduction and what it is like to live with a severe eating disorder for years. even when i talk about it, i feel like a lot of people misunderstand it. also, i notice very few posts from people who have both autism and anorexia, and people who aren't autistic probably do not understand or relate to the challenges of having both conditions. so my situation is very lonely.",
"side effects of recovery, help . hi everyone. after 8 years of ed, i started recovery 6 months ago in january. after getting back from a business trip a month ago, i started to forget to eat and log my meals that helped me during the first 5 months. i was more focused on my grandfather who had cancer and passed a week ago. now i am trying to catch back up, but i am having a chronic migraine for 26 days now and extreme hunger pains, both of which make me not feel like eating due to the pain. has anyone had a similar experience and have any tips to get back into recovery while battling the side effects of relapse? my doctor nor family have any helpful recommendations beyond just eat so i need a little help. maybe methods for eating? ways to stop the migraines? ways to eat while working 16 hour days? exhaustion prevention? thank you so much, love you all.",
"want to semi recover? tw . ok so, my tongue started feeling really painful because of all of the purging. i looked on my tongue and found a little black spot. i started freaking out. so i immediately went to google and got even more scared. eventually i rationalized one of two possibilities. 1. it was purge related 2. it was smoking related. neither of which my mom could know about. since then i have been brushing my tongue in that area and it seems to have gone away. but that was definitely a wake up call. no. more. purging. plus i m also a singer and can t have ripped up insides and smokers lungs. so, i threw all my vapes in the trash and haven t purged since. weirdly enough i don t think i ever got addicted to vaping despite the amount i would do it? i don t think i ever made the correlation between nicotine and mood, i kinda just used it as a suppressant . i just don t think i m ready to recover from an. but i really really wanna recover from bn and purging. anyone else have the same problem? or just any tips on how to stop purging? also, i know it s not much, but i m 2 days purge free and really happy about it.",

recovery help and tips.. i'm nearly 17 and i have been struggling with eating for a couple of years now to the point of feeling like farthing everyday. i haven't been diagnosed with any eating disorders but i do have alot in common with them especially a typical anorexia while not trying to self diagnose. it got really bad recently nearly ended up in a hospital so i decided to start eating more and weigh some weight. if anyone has any recovery tips or information that i may need to know or maybe something that no one seems to mention it would help me alot and maybe a few others who read this post. also if anyone could explain what weight gain after restricting for a long time might look like would help too. any even especially the discouraging from recovery facts are welcome as they'll help calm me down and not relapse once again. thank you,
"accept the signs to recover. tw: ed behaviour yesterday was really really difficult. i spiralled, my behaviour was horrendous, my mind was so lost, and i found myself in the phone to an ed helpline in tears, having purged for the 3rd time that day during what must ve been the sunniest amp; most beautiful evening there s been in weeks. the volunteer calmed me down, listened, was kind and genuinely cared for my well being. when you find yourself in a pit of despair, self loathing, feeling helpless, and speaking to a stranger instead of letting a loved one know 1 you have an ed that 2 you can no longer face alone .. this is a sign to actively dive headfirst into recovery. doing it by yourself is horrendous. i ve tried for four years and only failed. don t lose those sunny evenings because of an ed that has no respect for your beautiful soul. don t let the summer run away from you that easily.",

"what is wrong with me ?. tw hey all, first time posting on here not really sure what i m seeking whether it s advice or to find comfort with what i m dealing with but here it goes, for context about 3 years ago i was a 16 year old female weighing in about normal for my age but i was already pretty small but of course i had the chubby little stomach and baby face that i couldn t get rid of. during this time i was in a pretty toxic relationship which left me wounded emotionally. i had lost all my self worth and felt like i had deserved nothing. not gonna lie, i was heartbroken and depressed and all i wanted to do was forget about him by being with other people. this made me want to start taking more effort into my appearance and noticed one day how small my waist was and i would be satisfied but if there was a day where i was bloated i thought i need to be skinnier and would start restricting by cutting out meals and not even eating during the small period of time i was able to catch a break at work , mind you i worked at a restaurant and anybody that works at a restaurant knows that you can never catch a break on a busy night. i was also at the time smoking a lot of weed and picked up vaping which i had heard can curb your appetite. this overtime took a toll on me. i would wake up in so much pain, depressed and unable to get out of bed unless it was to go to work. i wouldn t even drink water but i lived off my vape, redbulls, and weed. whenever i did try to eat i could barely stand to even chew the food, i lost a lot of weight during this time and the more i looked in the mirror i saw how much smaller i had gotten and other people noticed too. it made me feel good like i had accomplished something.i would barely leave my room. this was in summer of 2 21 after the summer, i had gotten back with the toxic ex because of how shitty i was feeling, i felt like i had nobody to confide in about it, i will never forget the first thing he told me when he saw me was you lost a lot of weight word i ll never forget because of how much it fueled me. since this time we worked are shit out but i still had my own issues with eating i ve lost a conserving amount of weight. i m always cold, i feel like i don t remember anything,i am at my lowest all i want to do is restrict and i just feel so guilty eating. when i do eat i never finish my food and i feel very uncomfortable eating in front of others especially friends who sometimes will make me eat something when they notice i haven t ate which is very fucking triggering .i feel like the relationship really fucked me up in terms of how i feel about myself and i just don t know what to do anymore. i guess call this a rant if you will.",
new girlfriend opened up about her anorexia.. i was hoping that this community could help me at the very least avoid doing or saying anything that would make her feel bad or worsen her struggle. as far as i know she is in recovery but as she puts it me cooking her a meal or taking her out will result in her feeling compelled to make up for it by not eating the next day. what do i need to avoid or do for her? thanks.,

"the scariest moments of anorexia for me. 1. it weakened my immune system so much that my body had trouble recovering from a common cold. getting sick with a cold made me feel like i was literally dying while i was suffering from it. it took forever for me to get better. i was unable to ease the symptoms or the pain, due to having a weak immune system. it was the most horrible feeling. the pain was awful. this really scares me if i get something else, will my body be too weak to fight it? will i be strong enough to fight it? my friend died from pneumonia because anorexia made her immune system too weak to fight it. a weak immune system when you are anorexic is a very big deal, because it can mean you have a hard time fighting an infection or illness that an otherwise healthy person would be able to. 2. fainting spells. being alone and feeling faint. this is scary and a very big deal. passing out is not a good sign, and you shouldn't ignore this if it happens to you. you should tell someone 3. my liver almost failed on me at one point, and i had no idea, because i felt fine, even though i was really sick. i got lucky that doctors found this and got me nutritionally stabilized. they said i could have died from this. the scariest thing is that i would not have even realized it.",
