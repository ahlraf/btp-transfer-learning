"unpopular opinion: you don't recover from a ed. but you learn to manage the symptoms. much like other mental health illnesses. i'm tired of everyone saying i ""should have grown out of anorexia"". it started at age 13 and i'm now 3 . still anorexic. it's not a teen phase. it's a lifelong illness. i don't know why mostly teens have it or had it and tell me it magically disappeared. it's manageable but not curable and you cannot recover from a mental condition. mental health is for life. much like my ocd and bpd and other illnesses. but as i said, it's manageable with alot of hard work on a daily to keep it at bay to a lessor degree, depending on the person. but it is not something you recover from. you may gain weight as a external symptom perspective, but your mind will always have this disorders irrational pattern of how you see food and your body etc. i'm not trying to be a downer, i just think we need to cut ourselves some slack and realize that completely diminishing something is not possible. but that's okay self acceptance is far more powerful because most things in this world we cannot change and we need to start focusing our enegry on accepting that it won't be perfect instead of making ourselves feel bad for our mistakes during ""recovery"" and false hope that one day this will all just magically go away",
"how i used manifestation to cure myself of nearly 15 year struggle with bulimia. bulimia is a mental disorder. bulimia wires your brain to get stuck in an endless cycle. you are chained by it. a prisoner. a prisoner to your brain, the routine, the crutch, the reward system, the very wiring of your brain you've trained yourself to be entrenched in. the only cure is to rewire your brain. you have to make yourself not purge. you have to break the cycle. you overeat. you stop eating. you don't purge. you wallow and despair in the awful feeling it triggers to deny yourself the relief, to resist the urge. now you must do it a dozen, one hundred, one thousand times. it gets easier the more you do it, the more discomfort you face. the discomfort magically melts away with time. i used manifestation to help me resist the urges and bad thoughts, to help rewire my brain. it does take self control, it does take work but we are limitless beings and you can truly accomplish it. anyone can. the law of assumption is what i used specifically. because it is essentially deluding tricking your brain, it helps you rewire it with much more ease, much more complacency. here is a passage to sum up law of assumption: "" daring to assume that all things are possible to imagine, put this one reality to the extreme test by assuming you are the person you would like to be. your reasonable mind and outer senses may deny it; but i promise you: if you will persist, you will receive your assumption."" persist in your assumption that you are recovered, that you do not have those urges. that you never want to binge or purge again. if you mess up, do it again, test yourself if you can go longer and longer without purging. live in the delusion, in the assumption you are cured, and it will harden into fact. once you go without doing it for three weeks, it becomes so much freaking easier. for me it's been over 2 months and i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever feel compelled enough to do it again, and during those 2 months i had several stressful emotional situations where in the past, i would have easily capitulated. do you want to die a bulimic, stay bulimic, or are you willing to confront your discomfort and claim a better life, a life which you deserve and can have?",
"stupid question, but will wearing a retainer while purging protect damaging my teeth?. i really need to stop purging and idk if this is allowed but i m just curious. i m worried about the damage it s doing to my teeth i ve binged and purged 4 times this week already edit: thanks for the advice guys. def will not be wearing a retainer while i purge",
am i addicted to purging. is it possible to become addicted to purging after only one week? i don t seem to be able to stop even though my brain tells me it s not good for me and i tell myself i won t do it again ,
don't want to go into a b p session. i have been doing really good the past few days not throwing up and am feeling the tension stress anxiety of weight gain building. i have been feeling physically much better since not throwing up and am focusing on the reasons why not to do it. i really really don't want too but am feeling the onset of a binge purge session. seeking some support and advice to keep from doing this. thanks,
"does recovery mean gaining weight?. i'm eating more normally than before, and i'm constantly scared that i'm going to get fat. tbh i don't know if i want to recover if it means i'm going to gain weight ",
"adhd and bulimia??. i read that bulimia is somewhat common in people with adhd ,which was kinda interesting to me since i have adhd and i feel that my overeating and purging is mostly caused by my adhd. who else here has adhd and feels that it contributes to their bulimia?:o",
"i dont think its even weight. i dont look at my weight and i will eat, but its just the need to feel pain from purging and hunger, how do i stop feeling this way? or atleast how to cope?",
"well that lasted 11 days. decided i was going to focus on being kind to my body, getting back into exercising every day and go sober for the month and stop binging and purging. couldn t even do it. i literally ate a bowl of pasta and puked it all back up, even tho it was the first thing i d eaten today. wasn t even a binge. but now my stomach is triple it s normal size because of bloating and i just want to crawl in a hole. i don t even want to recover, i just want to be thin again, and i think if i recover it will help me in that journey. i m just exhausted and so tired of being the only one of my friends and family that struggles with a plethora of mental illnesses. i just want to be happy and free of these obsessive thoughts.",
"i haven t been doing well with my binging and am slowing gaining.. today, after a full week of eating heavy, unhealthy meals, i finally ate so much it actually made me sick. my first thought is if i get it out i ll feel better. i leaned over and as i brought my fingers up, i stopped. i haven t purged in 43 days. my cheeks don t look as swollen as they used to be. as much as i have regressed in the last months, i m happy i was able to walk away and sit with the feeling. i hope you all are staying positive and gaining strength from your struggles ",
"stopped mid binge. last night i decided that i really need to stop b p because it s going way too far. i m bingeing thousands of calories multiple times per day, wasting hundreds of pounds per week buying vomit food, and wasting time that i could be doing something i actually enjoy instead of bingeing. so, surprise surprise, i decided to have one last big blow out binge today. anything i was craving, my favourite binge foods, all that. i planned to just spend the entire day b p ing to get it out of my system . i was gt; 23 calories lt; deep into binge 1, pizza and mozzarella sticks in the oven, when i realised i was going to b p again tomorrow. and the day after that, and so on. because it s always just one last binge . this wasn t going to be my last, it was just going to send me deeper and deeper into the hole. so i turned off the oven, took the half cooked pizza out, and threw it all away. i know that s wasteful, but i had nobody to give it to and i didn t want the binge food to tempt me. if i had binged as planned, i ve calculated i would ve consumed gt; 1155 calories lt;. i would ve eaten it all as well, because i have no self control. i feel like this is a good first step towards recovery, even though i did still b p today. i ve never managed to stop mid binge. hopefully i can remind myself of this next time i want to binge.",
days without purging?. have y all ever had days where y all won t throw up the food y all at that day?,
is anyone else scared of clogging the toilet pipes?. i don t know if this is common or anything but i feel crazy for being scared of this,
drugs or medicines that worked for you?. i have seen a couple of people mention that adhd medicine and stimulants seemed to help it go away. i've also heard some people had good luck with wellbutrin bupropion . just thought it would be interesting to have a thread where people talked about what worked or didn't work for them.,
"what should i do? tw anorexia. what should i do? background information: i m 15f and last year i suffered from anorexia. idk if this is what is affecting me but i have been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and ocd. my depression has got much better over this past year. when i was a kid, i have this memory that sticks in my head of my dad coming into my room grabbing my stomach not in a forceful way and saying i was a pig. sometimes he calls me fat or when i stress eat, he says oh, you re going to eat all of that? and i think since i have adhd, all of this stuff resonates inside my head, like every time i walk past him it s all i can think about. however, to most people im not considered overweight, and always have been under the average weight for my age and height, but i would think about it so much that i would hate myself every time i look in the mirror and be disgusted when myself when i did eat. my mom says that my dad was overweight when he was a kid, and his parents did the same thing to him and that he doesn t know any better. my dad really cares for me and i know he doesn t mean to do it and that he s still working on himself, but im still extremely insecure about myself. last year, it was to the point where i would just not eat and sometimes i would faint, and i almost cracked my skull open because i fainted fell on the floor head first which hurt for like a few mins but i m very grateful to not have needed to have gone to the hospital . i feel like i m relapsing. sometimes i feel extremely insecure and i m absolutely terrified of ever reaching 12 pounds i m 5 5 and about 11 right now. i have no idea on what to do, any advice? the relapse of anorexia right now isn t as bad as last year, but i still have terrible body image ",

"i had a moment of clarity today: no more smart watch.. i ve b p for the better half of my life. and i ve wanted to stop as soon as i started. today i decided to stop wearing my fitness watch and stop tracking calories. my thoughts around these things are sooo obsessive and something just clicked today while i was sitting at work like what am i doing?? i want to get better yet i over analyze every calorie, step, and workout. i dedicate so much time thinking about this stuff. how am i ever going to feel free if i feel like i have to appease my dumb garmin watch that i paid too much money for and my fitness pal? no more ",
"controversial opinion?. soooo i'm back in therapy after a little break and a big relapse. and it just feels like total bullshit. it may be the fact that i really don't remember how it all started or how emotions and mental health played into it but what if it's not related? i mean, what if my pinging and purging isn't just about feeling sad or anxious. what if therapy can't help because it's not emotion related? what if it's all just vanity... it's all about weight and looks and not wanting to be fat again. what if it really is just the easy way out of not gaining weight and staying skinny. i could talk for hours about my emotions and still not fix this addiction that i have to binging and purging. it all just feels hopeless at the moment.",

early stages of bulimia. hi. i really wouldn t think i would end up in the place that i am now but here we are. i have early onset bulimia and still new to how everything works with recovery and support systems and ig what im looking for is advice or tips? ik the consequences and effects of eds and i really don t want it but i don t really know how to stop myself and i can feel my control of it slipping through my fingers day by day and it s scary. i do have a therapist but besides her and a friend that lives 2 hrs away from me no one else knows and it gets really lonely. any tips on telling parents? thanks everyone,
"i wish i knew how to help my brother. the first time i found out my brother was struggling was when we were both in middle school. he would say he would throw up because he felt too full. i didn t know what an eating disorder meant so i didn t know it was harming him i just thought he felt sick at the time. i also didn t know he continued after that but around high school college, i learned that he kept doing it every now and again. and it s gotten worse throughout the years we re in our 2 s now but now it s at its worst. he s extremely thin, probably the thinnest i ve ever seen him. and we still live together so i often hear him purging. i don t want to make this about me but my heart shatters every time i see and hear him. he comes to me often crying and telling me how he feels but i know that i can t do much to make things change for him. he just started medication and he has had a therapist for a while but it doesn t seem like much has helped. i think a big part of it is that he fears being judged by his therapist for being male and struggling with this so he doesn t open up often. i would do anything to take his pain away. i wish i had realized he needed help when we were kids. i wish i could find more resources about boys men with eating disorders. i wish he didn t feel so alone. im so afraid of losing him. i fear it everyday. i m writing this today because i heard him purging and i feel shattered. i just wish i could do something.",

stuck trapped. i dont know what to do i try posting here just about everyday yet i can never find the words. i can not stop binging and purging i'm exhausted and starving everyday i want to stop b p but it's been over 2 years of it and i dont mean 1x a week i mean daily. i dont even know how i'm not dead. i feel like it's just so far gone there is no way out. i guess i'm just ranting i dont know if there even is a way out for me. just endless hunger and exhaustion ,
"feels like i just quit a job i hate. really that s the only way i can describe recovering from my bulimia. it s like i finally walked off a full time job that made me miserable. a job that steals my pay and pushed me to my physical limits. i m free now and it really feels like i m on vacation since i got better. also, i had binge eating purging for a decade and only got better with stimulant medication. just wanna throw that in in case people are taking medication like prozac and not seeing any improvement. mention to your psychiatrist, it could save a life ",

"2 years recovered want to diet relapse. advice needed. hey all i've been recovered from bulimia for about 2 years now. i still unfortunately overeat and overindulge a little too often, so i'm currently at the edge of being obese. i thought i could get to a point where i didn't hate this body... but it hasn't happened yet. i'm still disgusted. what's making it worse, i have been seeing a lot of fatphobic posts and comments on social media a lot recently. honestly, just seeing how heavier people are looked down on is so disheartening. like it makes me want to give up. i really don't want to go back to the ed, but i do want to diet pretty badly. like i am obese, i feel i should do something about it. i do have a nutritionist, but i'm not really following a meal plan strictly. trying to be mindful. i'm sure some snack servings are on the larger side. overall though, i'm not binging. not purging. not restricting. it's so frustrating, i don't know what i'm doing wrong. i don't want to be this size forever. should i diet somehow? if i do diet, i'm so afraid i'm going to relapse. cherry on top, my fiance wants me to start exercising for health only . i struggle with other mental illness that results in severe fatigue. ultimately, day to day, i don't have the time or energy to bust out an hour workout. and honestly, i'm just so unmotivated. his prodding really makes me feel so guilty. i do want to work out in a normal healthy way, but i honestly don't know what to do or how to get myself started. he keeps recommending i go on walks, but i live in not the best of neighborhoods so i don't want to do that. too poor to afford a gym near me. i was thinking yoga pilates at home, but then it's just getting the motivation. sorry for the jumbled long text. i'd appreciate any advice.",

"recovery and its difficulties. i have struggled with food all my life, for many years i was extremely restrictive, over exercised, and was overall very weak. it became noticeable and i could barely walk without getting faint so i decided to eat more. this turned into a binge cycle where i would feel sick and i started to purge my meals. i was going through this binge purge cycle for so long it felt routine and normal. i was caught making myself throw up and felt humiliated and attempted to stop. i was good for a while and recovered well, but ofcourse that also meant weight gain. i was uncomfortable with it but felt like it was for the best until a friend made a comment and said i had gotten chubby . i immediately threw up as soon as i was home and had a full blown panic attack. since that relapse it has been so difficult to look at myself and ignore the thoughts saying they were right and i have let myself go. i have re entered the binge,purge, restrict cycle and i hate myself for it.",
"purging makes me feel grounded and i hate it. ive really been getting better but whenever i get overwhelmed or stressed i feel like i need to purge to make myself calm down. its not the binging that's important, it just feels like a necessity to get to the purging but as soon as i then get to this familiar point of sitting on the bathroom floor and throwing up, i get less overwhelmed or stressed and more calm. at this point i think this is the reason ill never get better.",

"accidentally causing a scene : . basically, i ve been using a lot of laxatives lately so, ofc, i ve become really desensitized to them. the day before yesterday i took 4 and literally nothing happened. in my frustration, i did something incredibly stupid and took another 5 6 hours before a shift. the first 1.5 hours of my shift were perfectly fine, but all of a sudden i started to feel extremely nauseous and having the worst stomach cramps of my life. i tried taking a quick rest but my shift manager asked me to get back up because just my luck our district manager decided to pop in today and see how everything was going. i pushed through for another 3 minutes, but at that point i became super cold and sweaty, my heart was racing, i had a horrendous headache, and i felt like i was about to pass out. i work in food service and this happened during a busier time. i kept telling myself to just push through it at the point i was only 2 hours into a 5 hour shift but it just kept getting worse and worse. i genuinely thought that i needed to go to the er because the pain had me doubling over all the while, im trying to seem completely normal bc the district manager was right across the room. i literally couldn t handle it anymore and went to my shift who is incredibly sweet and understanding and explained that i felt too sick to work. at that point, i genuinely felt like i was going to collapse, so when she asked if i could hold out for another 2 minutes so my coworker could finish up her break, i felt like crying. i said yes and tried to get back to work except i had to run to the bathroom every 1 minutes out of fear that i would start throwing up once again, i work food service so that would be worst case scenario . after about an hour, another one of my coworkers came up to me, took over and sent me home. none of my coworkers know why i suddenly got so sick but i m still really ashamed for not just holding out until the end of my shift. i left 2 hours early and, even better, i was covering for someone else. i just don t want to have to show my face again. at the same time i really feel like i should apologize to everyone for causing such a scene, an in front of the district manager too. everyone was stressed out as is and me leaving half way through my shift was one of the worst things i could have done. idk i just wanted to vent bc i feel like shit but i can t really tell anyone in my life what actually happened today.",
"rant of starting my recovery from bulimia, where should i start??. it's a never ending cycle of starving restricting myself and then purging and bingeing . i haven't even reached the weight i want to be, i weigh around 13 and i have this stupid dream of being 99 lbs which i know isn't healthy but it's just a thought that lives in my head . i'm too scared to reach out for help due to the fear of failure, i haven't even told my family because i know they wouldn't understand. i just wish i could go back to when i was younger and didn't care about how my body looked. it's just so hard to try and recover when i get judged for the stupidest of things, since i stopped eating so much my family always questions when i eat more than one meal a day. i never really realized how bad my eating disorder was until i watched a bunch of videos and read articles on how bulimia can kill someone. i didn't think there was anything wrong with me, i thought i was healthy and normal. it hurts sometimes and i just wanted to share my thoughts and let other people know that they aren't alone and if you're struggling right now just try and think of the good things you have in life, i know that can be hard and its scary sometimes but the road to recovery doesn't have to be faced alone . i've been trying to get better for almost a year on my own and i haven't really seen any improvements in my health, i got worse instead of getting better. so, if you can do it on your own then go for it but it might be best to have some guidance to help you step by step as you climb the ladder to recovery. sorry for my long rant on my life, i just don't know what to do anymore and am kinda lost haha.",
"does prozac help?. got prozac perscription from psychiatrist 2 days ago, i think mainly to treat ocd and depression will it help me with purging as well? will it make me more sui dal and anxious like some people say? ik it really depends and everyone has different experiences but i wanna hear your experiences",

"having trouble letting go of aesthetics. i want my top priority to be how i feel, but no matter how much i try to shift my mindset, the things that still matter most to me when it comes to my body are the number on the scale and how skinny i can get. i've seen the direct contrast between how much better life is during long periods of eating almost normally and not purging and exercising a reasonable amount. having energy and strength and stamina feels so good. but i'm 15 pounds up from my lowest weight and it seems like all i can focus on is getting back down there. as awful as it sounds, it doesn't matter to me that i was weaker at my lower weight, or that i had less muscle. i feel like it was the best i've ever looked. i don't know what it will take for feeling good to matter more to me than looking good.",

why does the scale go up so much every time i try to recover?. i m not talking about weeks or months of recovery. i m talking like going a couple days to maybe up to a week without purging. i gain an insane amount of weight on the scale and i have no clue if it s water weight from purging i m bloated everywhere especially my stomach or if i really am gaining so much fat.,
difficult to stop when it seems to be the only to be working for me.. years and years of dieting and exercising and yet i am still extremely large. i ve been purging 8 of my meals for the last 2 weeks and the scale is dropping extremely fast. i know this ed is detrimental to my overall health but it s insane as i know the more weight i ll lose the more congrats i ll receive. it s also very odd being a bigger person with a ed. i don t know what kind of post this is but i felt like writing in this sub to see if anyone else can relate to me as it seems that i can t relate to anyone these days.,

how bulimia has taken over my life. i ve had all sorts of eds since i was 11 years old. in middle school i used to skip my lunches. then it became skipping lunch and dinner. it got so bad i remember one time my friend came to school with an extra lunch box and said her mom made it for me because she told her i never ate during lunch. i never knew what it was back then. it was like a game to me like how long could i go without food. i struggled with anorexia up until my junior year of high school. i started having a lot of family issues then and the anorexia turned into binge eating. i gained like 1 pounds in a year. i didn t even recognize myself. but those years were nothing compared to when i first discovered purging. i left college halfway into my freshman year to move back home more family issues . at the time i d started withholding food again but i stopped for at least a year after moving back home. i had a healthy mindset about food but i was still over weight. i decided to start loosing weight and i remember being so good in the beginning. i was exercising regularly and eating normal portions. i lost about 2 pounds the healthy way. then it started to take longer to lose a pound and i started getting frustrated. i wanted a faster way to get rid of this weight. so i went back to bulimia. it wasn t too bad at first maybe i d purge once a week. then it went up a few times a week. now i purge every day after everything i eat. i spend half the day bingeing and the other half purging. i ve lost over 4 pounds in 3 months. everyone praised me for losing the weight it feels almost like they re encouraging my ed. i m constantly thinking about food. i can t control myself around it the urge to binge is far greater than any will power i have left. then the shame i feel afterwards and the need to purge comes along. i don t go out to restaurants anymore. friends and family ask me out and i always find an excuse. i m in the bathroom for 2 minutes after every meal. i feel like everyone in my life must know by now even tho i try to hide it. i get so paranoid thinking they re all talking about how disgusting i am. sometimes i want to just sit with my family and eat pizza in the living room while we watch a movie. but i know i would have to excuse myself to the bathroom after eating 4 slices and hating myself for it. my throat is constantly sore and my teeth are now stained yellow. i m always scared i smell like vomit. and i can t stop. i m afraid i ll never have a normal life again.,
"checking in.. what up party people i'm on lunch salmon filets with a bit of rice and asparagus . it's been 6 months since i posted and since my last event. i feel great. i've had urges here and there but i haven't gone through with the act. if it helps anyone about 5 months ago i started doing this thing where i stopped eating alone. if i get hungry i will ask a some one to join me. i'll meet anyone anywhere, i'll have someone come over to my place or go over to theirs. i found this helps keep my eating senceable in 2 ways. the first way is if i'm eating alone i'd order a 12 pack of tacos, 2 quesadillas and a crs at tacobell then feel like shit about it. with some one around a single meal will do. the second way is after the meal i'm not alone. i can't just run off and blow chunks. usually after the meal their is something planned or we'll sit around talking for a bit giving the meal time to digest. maybe this is something that can help some of you. i hope it helps. how is everyone coping? i really want to know. this thing, bulimia interrupts logical thought. you only focus on feeding the urge and seeking relief. it can also be lonely and reluctance to ask for help out of shame further isolates you.if anyone wants to shout out or vent hit me up. i'll talk back. im at work but i'll get to you. i hope you're all moving in a positive direction.",
"my one reason for recovery was just taken away, i can t do this anymore. the only thing that has even somewhat pulled me through my ed has been volleyball, it s what helped me almost fully recover the first time, but now i don t have volleyball anymore and i have no idea what to do anymore. today i found out that i m ineligible for my schools volleyball team this season. playing this season has kept me motivated to improve my relationship with food so i could stay healthy so i could play to my full potential, but now i don t have any reason to recover. i was offered the manager position, but that just feels like an insult, just to watch my old teammates play and have fun in game, all while i watch from the sidelines being entirety useless. i m so done with everything, right now i m feeling so discouraged and i ve got absolutely no idea what to next, the past two years of dedication and hard work have been reduced to nothing in a matter of a few minutes. i can t do this anymore.",

"how did you get to the next stage of your recovery?. i consider my self miles better that i was say a year ago and even during that fee year period i was better than i was during my late teens to early twenties. i feel like i've hit another plateau. after getting proper therapy, she decided to treat me as if i had cptsd she's probably the only successful therapist psychologist i had in 11 years after multiple failed attempts at cbt and working on my diet a little bit i engage in the behaviour way less, can actually keep actual food stocks in my house. i've been at this stage for a year which has been great and a better stage than i ever imagined i would come but i know it's far from recovered. but i still definitely do it at least 2 5 times a week and straight up can't keep a pretty extensive list of food in my house or know once i start eating said foods i won't stop. i've tried, it just doesn't happen. it's mostly an anger stress distress coping mechanism. to a very minor degree weight control although if i didn't eat such insane amounts i wouldn't feel the need to use it this way. ideally i'd want to utilize it as a coping mechanism less, so realistically if i ended up doing it 1 2 times a week and was able to expand the range of food i did keep in the house, enjoy and be excited about my life a bit more. i know cold turkey will immediately fail, i think i'll turn into a nasty hysterical raging crying monster within two weeks if we take that route.",
"bulimia with drinking problems ?. the first thought would be to drink, just one, just a little, something you can control, and after several nothing seems to matter pretty much, so why not a sandwich cookie sausage that i would enjoy? i won t mind having to purge, i ll get better relief from just eating, which is like the only relief i ll ever have so eat. and i fill myself up with horrible things like pastry and whatever overdosed on fat carbs, and i purge, and the nightmare scenario: i don t purge for i passed out by drinking too much",
"8 months since my last purge. it's officially been over 8 months since my last purge. never thought i'd get here. i've struggled with this disease since i was 14 and am now 27. and have never gone this long, and never been this confident that i will never go back. the urges have completely disappeared. i had a serious health scare that truly scared me straight, and it finally clicked in my mind that if i don't stop i will literally die. i tried healthy keto and it saved my life. the extreme hunger went away along with a lot of anxiety. i have been doing it for 8 months now and never felt better. and no, not to lose weight, i'm still almost the exact same weight which is on the higher end of a healthy bmi for me i did it to prevent diabetes i was definitely on the road to getting, and for the satiety. my entire life i have always been chronically hungry until keto. this really does work. along with keto, i really had to get real with myself and stop making excuses for the behaviors. we can always come up with one, but they are always just an excuse. this will kill us if we don't stop. i used junk food like a drug and basically had to detox off of sugar as a heroin addict detoxes off drugs. it was very hard at first but i had to do it. and it saved my life. this disease is no joke. i thought i was the weakest person in the world but now i have never felt stronger. not just in my body, but in my mind and spirit. i thank god every day i am still alive and this far out of the living hell i created for myself.",

"didn't know this group existed.... sooooo hi. i began b p when i was about 14. i was abused growing up. and always told that i fat, chubby, ugly, you name it. well, after i was groomed and then sexually assaulted at 13, things got bad for me in my mind. at 14 i started the b p because i was so tired of all the bullshit. at least this was something i had control over in my life. so i thought. it was controlled for the most part and i stopped when i was 16. i thought i was cured or something. well, when i was 18, my boyfriend at the time kicked me out. this triggered it again. i got it to stop after he took me back a couple months later. when i was 2 , my mom died, my husband hated me, i cheated, and we divorced. i ended up starting up again. i lost like fifty pounds i think within a two month period. i would barely eat. then whatever i did eat i would purge it. i was very active at that time. so the weight just poured off. well, we got back together. i got pregnant and i stopped again. over time my depression got worse and instead of b p i would just straight up binge. i gained all that weight back and more. i felt gross. but couldn't stop. eventually i left him. i started up again. and stopped eating for the most part. the weight came off again. but when i got with my current husband i was okay again. stopped, got pregnant, used that pregnancy as an excuse to binge. no exercise. ugh it was horrible. but i got through. since then, i've only b p once or twice. i binge a lot still though. however, with some issues in my family, i'm starting to not eat again. i've been restricting my intake and saying i'm just fasting till dinner. i don't eat as much as i normally would. and small portions fill me. i've already lost a little weight. i guess i'm just looking for support of sorts. i'm in therapy. and i'll probably bring it up to her next time we talk as i just realized things are kicking up again. but in the meantime idk how to stop. i feel gross. i'm a stay at home mom, full time college student, and i have a lot of responsibilities with three kids and husband. i think stress possibly kicked it up, if i look back at my history. but still. i'm thirty years old come january. you'd think something like this would decide to finally stop. lol ya know? thanks for reading if you did.",

starving. hi i recently for the past couple of months have started to worry about my body and my body weight to a point where it was the only thing i was thinking about. i don t even know if i have an eating disorder or anything like that but i have started to lose weight and i don t know what to do. i love the feeling of being hungry because it makes me feel like i m doing something right for once and i can t help but feel proud when i skip a meal or find a way to secretly throw out my food. my family is very strict and i don t think i can talk to anybody about it for now. i don t know what to do and i m scared that i m gonna die one day but i m still obsessed over my body and it feels like an addiction.,
"kids commenting on me. so.. i was at a buffet, and the neighboring table a family with a bunch of kids sat there chatting, done with eating. i'm sitting alone and on my third portion, when the kids start shouting to her mom ""look that girl that girl "" points to me ""she eats so much she is on her third portion "" the parents don't answer, clearly embarrassed. but i just sunk into my seat, as i felt everybody in the restaurant suddenly turned they eyes towards me..",
"positive reasons to recover lt;3. there may have been a post like this in the past, but i can t seem to find it. i m trying to make a list of positive reasons to recover physical, mental, emotional and would love more ideas of what your top reasons to recover are. i ve seen and made a list of all the negative consequences and side effects of bulimia, but really want to list out the pros and things that would make my life better by recovering, too. mine are: 1 be able to be closer and spend more genuine time with friends and people i love bulimia isolates and separates me from people i love with the shame and secrecy. i can be hanging out with someone and my mind will be fixated on food and b p after i see them, or will cancel plans altogether. 2 see and like what my face actually looks like in its natural state, without swollen glands cheeks from purging. my face being puffy and swollen is a huge trigger to me, yet i know in order to get it to go down, i need to not purge. this feels like a significant goal for me, to see and know what my face really looks like minus purging 3 get rid of the shakiness, dizziness, heart palpitations, and brain fog caused by bulimia. my focus, concentration, memory and mental clarity has gone downhill so much, as bulimia s got worse over the past year and a half. i feel like my attention span and intelligence is so much lower than it was. i really, really want to be able to focus, engage in topics i used to be interested in, and think more clearly most of the time. there are many many more would love to hear your top reasons that make you really want to recover x",

so fucking tired. feeling like shit,
husband doesn't understand how difficult eating disorders are.... my husband touched at my stomach flab as i was sitting down. he didn't do it i'm a mean way but still made me feel like he looks at my body and sees how i'm not stick thin anymore...i was like are you pointing out how i'm fat? he said it's not that your fat or not it's more of like a spectrum. in the past he has told me that he'd rather i throw up than get fat. i don't think he understands how serious and mentally challenging it is to struggle with an eating disorder. i feel like i cannot recover fully and stop throwing up because if i do he notices that my stomach gets softer and also doesn't seem to care if i do it or not. he is aware that i have had anorexia bulimia since i was 14 years old off and on. he knows that i have been in treatment and been hospitalized but don't understand why he would act like that. i feel a lot of pressure from him to remain in my eating disorder because he comments on other people's weight all the time including making gestures at me like touching my stomach.,

"i just need to vent somewhere where no one knows who i am. i describe it as bulimia with orthorexic tendencies. if it's ""unhealthy"" amp; i don't think it's worth absorbing the calories for the nutrition it provides, i purge. so an arugula salad i can keep down. but a pizza? i'll eat the whole thing, so i can't have more later, amp; then puke it. i'm not totally sure labelling it with ""orthorexic tendencies"" is the best or most responsible descriptor but that's what i see fit for now. it started a little over a year ago in february of 2 21 when when i weighed myself and was like 2 8 lb. i had thrown up before maybe a couple times here amp; there since i was about 13. but this past year is when the disorder really kicked off and it became a habitual thing that i realized was effective. at first i threw up anything without categorizing it is good or bad and deciding what i don't want to metabolize. but when my hair started thinning out, i focused a lot on nutrition and eating the right foods. so i started taking vitamins and then i let myself keep down nutrient dense meals. amp; id only get rid of the bad things. over time, i started to just be repulsed by the idea of eating anything bad altogether. so i didn't have to purge as much. but as eds tend to, it got worse amp; around march of this year, i started to have the urge to get rid of the good foods too if i thought i was eating too many calories to still lose weight. since then i have tried to recover but i think i fully relapsed. i gained 1 pounds while in recovery and now i'm back to purging bad foods and only taking good foods and i'm trying to restrict the calories of the good food that i take in so i can still lose. amp; i'm slowly getting back to being disgusted by ""unhealthy"" things. amp; having an easier time not eating them. which is good. but i don't want to get to a point where i feel like i need to purge the good food. the food that actually benefits my body. which is why i'm restricting the calories of it. i now weigh about 145. in season 2 of my bulimia, i've graduated from vomiting to also using laxatives but i try to use those sparingly as to not develop a tolerance amp; to avoid any intense electrolyte depletion. this is hell. amp; i'm so tired. i just want to be normal. amp; i know where this all stems from. i know why it started to begin with but i can't dismantle it now. amp; i can't just recover amp; let myself gain weight either. so much of my self worth has been tied to how pretty amp; fuckable i can make myself. that's mostly a result of a physically, psychologically, amp; sexually abusive relationship i had been in for the past two years, along with other things. i won't go into detail of what specific events caused which specific behaviors amp; the thought process behind them. that's a lot to unpack. i tell myself that once i hit the certain number, i can just eat to maintain. but i know that eating disorders are brutal amp; don't work that way. i know that i'll just aim lower. i've already started to set lower goal weights before even hitting the original. amp; if i'm being totally honest i don't see an end to this. i try to imagine what it'd be like to be okay with my body amp; its fluctuations that are bound to come throughout life. but that sounds impossible. i don't know how i can ever balance a healthy awareness of what i put into my body amp; my energy expenditure. amp; i'm scared. i don't trust myself to balance enough to not gain or not fall into disordered patterns once i do decide to recover. i'm terrified by the reality that i'm already to deep into this amp; i will never truly be okay. i don't know how much i've actually come to terms with how utterly damaged i am. amp; how irreparable it is. these are traumas amp; patterns i will constantly have to manage for the rest of my life amp; i don't want to burn out so much to the point that i reach suicidal intent. but i've been there before, before i even had the eating disorder. amp; i can see it coming. it's just a matter of when amp; how i can intervene before it gets to an attempt. i'm not okay amp; no one really knows how bad it is. they know im fucked up but not this much. amp; i don't know what to do except do everything i can to get to the number amp; get better before i die.",

"any tips for how to talk to my dad about his comments regarding what i eat?. so quick backstory, my parents abused me growing up, i coped by eating myself sick. literally. food was far more a comfort than a necessity. when i was small, my parents had a side by side fridge, and they padlocked it as well as the pantry, so i couldn t wake up at 1 am and sneak food. i recall one evening in particular, one i ll never forget: i was maybe 1 . we went to a lion s club fish fry fundraiser because our landlord was in the lions and got us tickets every time they did their quarterly fry, and i had been fighting with my parents all day. we sat at the table, and they kept coming around to top off our pieces of fish, potatoes, etc it was ayce and i literally ate until my body couldn t take it anymore, and threw it all back up, all across the table. it was mortifying, even more so because it was binge eating, something that i felt was entirely out of my control, something that they warn us against when they discuss bulimia and anorexia in health class. i never put it together until five years ago when i got help for an opiate addiction not only was i addicted to eating, i was over 4 pounds and pre diabetic. fast forward. my relationship with food has significantly changed, thanks to outpatient rehab for drugs. the coping mechanisms are the same. now, i eat when i m hungry, i eat sweets if i m craving them, i drink sodas when i want them, but i often don t. sugary soda is too sugary now. and i m not eating an entire box of snack cakes in one go. i m mindful of what i eat, i stopped chugging mt dew and switched to diet coke and liquid death sparkling water because i hate flat water with a fuckin passion, and i fast intermittently. those three changes, being mindful, cutting sugar in pop and being more hydrated, as well as not eating for certain hours of the day, have been a turning point for me. i have a long way to go, and i know that even though i ll struggle, i will continue to lose weight. however. i live with my parents; my dad is disabled and needs a live in to get by. my dad is concerned, because i eat too much, when in actuality, a, he has no idea what i m eating or how much unless i directly tell him, and b, he s one to talk. he s an insulin dependent diabetic, but i keep my mouth shut about his addiction to sweets, because it s none of my business. today, i had a paper plate with six strawberries and a piece of roast beef lunch meat, and an avocado in a bowl with some salt. bc i don t like my foods to touch. the avocado had a weird texture so i didn t eat more than half of it. i ate half the meat and all of the strawberries. and then i waited for half an hour. i was still hungry so i decided to make popcorn. at which both of my parents piped up and my dad asked if i had ever considered keeping a food journal yes dad, i did that. i kinda got really irritated with him for that. he said it s because he s concerned about me, but he also has a lot of control issues, and i m not totally convinced it has nothing to do with that. i want to educate them about binge eating bulimia, as well as educate them on how much better i am but i have never really had to have this conversation. they don t even realize that i had an ed, and i m not sure they ll even believe that it is one but i d like to try. any tips?",

"how do i fix my relationship with food?. so, to start out, i didn't always have an unhealthy relationship with food. growing up, my mother, while abusive, was an excellent cook. plus, growing up in a family of all big eaters, i learned to love food pretty early on. i always had a big appetite, but was one of those like my family who have that lovely genetic blessing that allows them to eat and eat and eat and eat and never gain an ounce. unfortunately, i developed a condition called pcos around the age of 12 that caused me to blow up like a literal balloon put on 5 pounds in 2 months at 5 feet tall . even more unfortunately, this went undiagnosed for a decade i only recently found out about it. mom instantly started picking on me and saying it was because how much i was eating, which started my inevitable downward spiral into eating disorders, depression, body image issues, etc. i couldn't just learn to stop loving food, with food being one of the only positive things i can associate my mom with during my childhood so naturally i'm an extremely emotional eater. doesn't matter what the emotion is, it makes me want to eat. its like it's just hardwired into my brain as some kind of weird coping mechanism. over the years, i packed on quite a few more pounds. it wasn't until i hit 2 lb that i finally said enough is enough and started doing research about it. weeks of research and several doctors visits later, and i finally got diagnosed with my condition. at that point, i had the tools and knowledge i needed to finally be able to lose weight. i was successful for the first 6 lb and i actually did it in a healthy way i started eating less processed food, working out regularly, managing portion control, etc etc. it's been working up until a couple weeks ago. suddenly all my previous food urges came back to me and i feel like i can't control myself anymore. i tell myself ""i just ate i'm not hungry, i'm already full."" and then my body just goes on autopilot and i eat more anyway, which of course leads to me binging and purging again for the first time this year. i was doing so good, but now i'm starting to gain the weight back again only 5lbs so far and i just feel such a loss of control. as a recovering alcoholic, i can confidently say that these food cravings are just as bad, if not worse, than alcohol cravings. i used to pour bottles down the sink to keep myself from it but i've never thrown food out, or even given it away. i just can't. its like i'm falling off the bandwagon again but this time with food instead of alcohol. i guess that i just didn't realize until now that i'm going to have to fix my relationship with food if i want to lose weight and keep it off. i guess i just got so excited when i finally understood what was going on with my body that i didn't even take my food relationship into consideration until it started rearing it's ugly head again. i can do all the right things at all the right times, but eventually i'm going to squander all the results i'm seeing with my binging unless i get control of it, and since my weight was the initial cause of the eating disorder, it lands me right back in that vicious cycle of loving food and hating my body that i lost my teenage years to. so if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, i would greatly appreciate it. i don't even know where to start. do i train myself to stop enjoying food so much? if i try to teach myself the ""just eat when you're hungry"" rule, i just end up binging and purging again. i tried googling, but only came up with the same lame, generic stuff my therapist told me. i'm sure that stuff works for some people, but it never worked for me. so i just thought sharing some context on what the root of the problem is might make a difference.",
"triggering stuff that happened today. so i was weighing myself today and was really happy that i lost 11 pounds this last month. admittedly it wasn't entirely healthy, but i was still very happy. my parents noticed i was smaller and gave me the obligatory ""make sure you're eating enough dont be throwing up"" speech. i told some of my friends about the weight loss, and one of my friends, who's a pretty short small guy, mentioned his weight as well and i texted that i finally weigh less than him, in like a happy way, and he wrote back ""took you long enough"" and that was pretty soul crushing tbh, because the reason it took so long was because i was trying to do it in a healthy way except for the last half of the month... and all it did was confirm that the only way i can really get results is with ed behavior. i have hypothyroidism so it makes it a bit slower to lose weight healthily. i've fallen back into old habits... and i'm so so happy that it's working, i dont even care that i feel like shit all the time, i deserve it anyways. it's working and that's what matters to me.",

"i think i need some help.. i've struggled with bulimia for 14 years. i've never really talked about it with anyone. my mom and sister know but they never ask about it and i never say anything about it. i recently discovered a new technique where i can tighten my abdomen and force vomit up. literally massive amounts of food and drink purged in like ten seconds, and no gagging or sticking my finger down my throat. my problem is that now it is just too easy. nothing is stopping me from purging 3 4 times a day. anyways i'm worried about my long term health and really want to quit. any tips?",

"has anyone stopped purging because of calories and instead because they hate feeling full?. hello i ve suffered from bulimia for 6 years now and before i would have b ping episodes and do the classic eat and purge right after because i was afraid of weight gain. anyways, now that i ve gotten older i still binge right before i sleep but i don t purge until the morning 5 hours later . it s not even because i care for the calories but rather i hate feeling full. is this still normal? i m not sure what to think considering i ve never had this way of thinking for my bulimia until now. i guess it s more of just something i wanted to share because i m not sure if much people feel the same",

"how can i help my sister with bulimia and anxiety?. my sister, 15yof has been battling bulimia and intense anxiety for around a year now and i feel like she has only gotten worse despite many efforts : . for example, she recently had a very bad panic attack when told she can only drink regular sodas instead of diet and she isn t allowed to buy stevia packets for at home use, just because my family thinks that it s very much ed behavior and they try to limit that. she also had a really bad anxiety attack today when my mom refused to pull over on the highway to let her throw up after she said she binged a mcdonald s 6 piece, and comforting thru her panic attacks is very hard when she says the only way she can feel better is if we allow her to binge. of course we do everything we can to stop her from purging , but she is extremely smart and always finds ways to do it. we do our best to prohibit her from doing a lot of the things we think enables her to continue her eating disorder and restrictive diet, but she has always been very healthy conscious i guess and it has allowed her to continue her diet under that guise . is there any advice on how to console or comfort her during these attacks whilst also trying to prevent her from purging or enabling her unhealthy habits without triggering her anxiety? or just any tips in general i could use as someone who s kind of emotionally unintelligent who really just wants to help their sister : ",
"purged something i ate gt;15 hours ago. i b p ed this morning and i threw up some vegetables i ate at dinner last night. full chunks of carrots and broccoli, so they were definitely from dinner and not binge food. i stopped purging after that so idk if the rest of my dinner hadn t been digested either, but is that normal? like i ve seen some people say about throwing up parts of their previous meal hours later, but 15 nearly 16 hours later?",

"a little rant on bulimia. i never got diagnosed as being bulimic but i ll eat food and feel ashamed and will purge. i would purge nonstop like at restaurants and anywhere i went with a bathroom, i even did it at my friends house, i don t think i m asking anything more of a rant but i haven t had food in 3 days and i finally ate something today and it just went right back up, i ve been losing weight but i m so obsessed with the scale and weigh everyday it s tiring but at the same time i want fast results, i go to the gym but i feel even if i hit my goal i m not gonna be content with myself still that s it",
"this disorder is crazy. this is just a rant but i honestly just don t even understand how bulimia is a thing. for the past few weeks i ve been doing really well when it comes to binging and purging. given, this is because i ve been exercising and kiiind of restricting?? like not really restricting but just eating safely but also eating little random snacks here and there. i rarely cook meals without tracking them and weighing them because thats what helps to keep me from wanting to purge but for the past few days i ve been able to kind of just eat whatever my work or family makes and estimate the cals. also, my work really has been helping simply because they make us meals and i even look forward to being forced to eat what they make us. not actually forced, but it s made specifically for us to eat and everyone eats it so i feel okay when everyone else is, even though it s always comfort foods like lasagna, alfredo, mac and cheese, etc., but it feels freeing i guess. anyway that was kind of me rambling. but i ve been weighing myself most days and it s remained steady so i ve been doing a trial of what my maintenance calorie intake is based on weight fluctuations. i think i ve figured it out for the most part, but then i randomly shot up by like 4 lbs between a few days and i freaked tf out. now i know this is not really possible, so i was able to calm down by telling myself it was water weight, and then today i was back at my normal weight. but naturally, this kind of made me spiral. by this, i mean that today i had a party to go to, and yesterday i literally planned that i would be purging afterward. this morning i said that i felt better due to the fact that i looked reaaaally skinny , but then at the party i was eating wings and mac and cheese, baked beans, etc., which still did not bother me, until out of nowhere my brain told me to take a plate to go so i could binge on it a little. so i did, and then i went to the store and got some dessert. anyway, i ate the food, and like a pint of ice cream, a taco i had leftover, and one cookie. after that i was stuffed and purged, but i didn t even like feel bad about it. i almost didn t even want to purge because i m at the point where i m realizing that binging and purging makes me gain weight but eating normal amounts of whatever i want and carrying on does not. so idk, just a rant. i honestly feel like i m not very bulimic anymore, but i do like that the option is there if i want it to be.",

"no physical symptoms?. i always see lists of potential symptoms bulimics can experience. however, even after being bulimic for around 2 years, i have stil yet to experience any of them. i have a few symptoms which are just: dizzy spells, i see god every time i stand up or sit down, sore throat, slight dehydration, mouth ulcers, heart burn, acid reflux and constipation. however things like vitamin or electrolyte deficiencies are something i've never had? though i feel like it's common. same with tooth decay, and like swollen salivary glands. i'm aware i'm lucky not to have any of these, and i'm glad i dont. but i still can't help but feel like my bulimia's not that bad then? that i'm not sick enough to get better, or get help. just my stupid monkey brain, but ahhhh it kills me a bit. plus my mum and people around me are kind of enforcing that thought in my hand. like, ""oh, you don't need treatment you aren't sickly enough or underweight."" or my mum's famous words of wisdom, ""you can't be bulimic until you vomit without wanting to without forcing it "" i'm not asking to get those symptoms, i'm more so upset that i'm not ""bad enough"" even after 2 years of bulimia. is my ed just a whole lie? even after purging 2 6 times a day, i'm still not bad?",

"funny story again. but tj maxx instead of a sushi restaurant. this story is long but pls read. okay, so this was the kickstarter to my laxative abuse. this was before the sushi restaurant story i have. i had found these super generic laxatives that worked very well. like to the point where if i took two i would have to have a nearby toilet most of the time. so of course, i would take multiple throughout the day my god please dear lord don t ever do that . so, as always, i m in my routine when my sister wants to go shopping with our then nanny long story . she wants to go to tj maxx. i m sitting on the couch while on my phone eavesdropping on the conversation and pipped up. can i come? i need more clothes. which was so desperately true considering i was a growing teen whose clothes always shrunk in the wash. i was living on the same two outfits for that whole summer. so, we re getting ready to leave when i ask how long they thought this was going to take. my oblivious nanny replied an hour, maybe two . now, this was incredibly risky and lord knowssss i knew it too. i remember myself literally calculating how the time frame would work like okay if i speed up my sister s shopping by 3 min and i just grab one or two things bla blah blah by this point in the day i was a horrid number of laxatives in. so the three of us get in the car and take the 7 1 minute drive to tj maxx. we pull up and i could feel my stomach lurch because of the physical movement of walking. i immediately knew i was in trouble because that lurch is what i felt when the laxative started to kick in. i didnt even make it to the first aisle until my stomach started it s inner battle with my intestines. i thought it was just a really bad stomach ache. because the laxatives had never done this to me before. i looked around for a bathroom, to no avail. nothing. i told my nanny i wasn t feeling good and was going to hang out in the car until they were done. as i was waking in the parking lot, out of nowhere, i could feel liquid shit trying to push its way out of me. this startled me and almost made me shit my pants, and so i froze for a moment to use all of my remaining willpower to clench the hardest i had ever clenched up until that point. i am truly amazed how i didn t shit right then and there, i book it to the car and by this point i am sweating bullets, like full on whole body sweating trying to resist the urge to shit. i think i almost started crying. i got into the car and fidgeted for what felt like an hour to situate myself in a position where i wouldn t immediately implode on myself. i was in a dire state of stress and anxiety and was frantic. i screamed at my phone hey siri call nanny. of course, the stupid ai didn t know if i said if i wanted sushi or a massage. i once again screamed siri call nanny im sorry agghhhggg this was like pure agony. i opened my phone to find my nanny s number. it was super difficult because i was shaking like a leaf. i called her and she didnt pick up. i was about to scream. i called her again and she picked up on about the fourth ring. now i don t remember my exact conversation with her but i think it went something like nanny i m gonna shit myself what? nanny i m gonna shit myself please get out here now asap now now she said okay and hung up. no hi or bye. just extreme urgency. now for the wait. and oh my god. she took a total of 5 minutes aka an eternity to get out to the car. when they got into the car my sister looked wildly concerned and we drove. the nearest bathroom was the jack in the box across the street. we get to it s parking lot and i stroll up acting as if i wasn t holding back fucking boulders with my ass cheeks. i tried to open the door. locked. . . . im gonna die today. turns out it was closed for renovation. i sprinted back to the car. the new nearest bathroom was back at home. as we started driving i remember saying to my nanny if i shit in your car, i m so sorry after 7 minutes of hell, miraculously, we made it home without my shitting myself. i ejected myself out of the car before it even stopped moving and once again made a run for my life to nearest bathroom in my home. i sat down and a wave of relief came over me, that i could kept part of my dignity. i then exploded. violently. i literally braced myself with the bathroom walls. so violent the toilet water was splashing at my bare ass. i was shitting for i think 3 minutes. but alas, no casualties, minus the toilet that had just been obliterated. i stepped out of my bathroom feeling somewhat accomplished. proud of myself and my willpower. and the immediately magnetized myself right back to that same toilet for the aftershock of the laxative. anyways, that s the story. this was very long i know. but, would you like to know the best part of this story? a few years later i went back to that same tj maxx. there was in fact, a bathroom. this whole. time.",

"struggling with so much alone time.. a little background info: i'm 32 and have been diagnosed with bn since i was about 24. i am mostly in recovery, with some small slips here and there. i tend to take a harm reduction approach with my recovery and avoid trying to follow a super specific meal plan, trying to do things perfectly, etc. i lean more toward intuitive eating and that has worked out really well for me. that said, i have struggled with eating during the day for quite a few years. it has slowly gotten better, but i still really struggle with breakfast. i used to be primarily bed and just compulsively overeating... i didn't start other behaviors until my early mid 2 s. when i first started restrictive and compensatory behaviors, i was also trying out keto type diets. that led me to intermittent fasting, and boy did i latch onto that one lol. that and low carb were my first true diet obsessions, and i engaged in those behaviors for a while before starting to purge more regularly. i was essentially binging at night and purging by fasting the next day. eventually it got so bad that i was bping multiple times daily. miserable. fast forward to today after inpatient, therapy, meds, dbt, emdr, nutritionists, so much therapy lol. still doing therapy biweekly. still on meds. i'm doing pretty well. my partner and i used to work similar hours, and we got to eat dinner together. so even if i struggled eating a bit during the day, i at least always got a really solid dinner and never purged it. welp, now he's working until 1 pm or so, and i'm working mostly 8am shifts. i'm feeling some... habits begin to pop back up. today i went grocery shopping and bought a lot of ready to eat stuff so i don't have to worry so much about cooking after work, and i straight up bought several safe foods as well without really thinking about it. i purged once a few nights ago and felt super gross about it. there's just so much alone time. i mentioned my concerns to my best friend, and she said she feels confident that i won't sink back into it because i'm aware of it. we both have some form of disordered eating, hers more arfed type stuff. we also both have bipolar 2 and anxiety. she kind of understands in a way, but the pull to lose weight isn't there for her. she's actually self conscious of how thin she is. so she doesn't quite understand that my ed is fucking insidious and wants to trick me. it wants me to be complacent and fall into old habits. she has a point i feel exhausted thinking about doing things the way i used to do back in my worst days. the fact that i've mentioned it in therapy, to a close friend, and am posting here says that i don't truly want to relapse. but i also am really suffering with my body image lately, and being alone more often, thus being able to micromanage my intake and skip meals, is not helping one bit. eh, i guess that's it really. i just.. needed to say it to people who would understand. i don't wanna relapse. i'm scared. but i feel myself sooooo ready to hide everything again and dive right back in. stupid ass illness. i got this, right yall?",

"chinese food. trigger warning. bad advice warning .so . i m like 8 months purge free. maybe 1 or 2 slips in that 8 months. i forgot to bring lunch to work and was very hungry by 2 o clock, they had chinese food catered to the office. i already don t like chinese food bc it kills my stomach. but i was so hungry i inhaled a plate of greasy lo mien and then ate an egg roll that had pork in it, even tho i don t eat pork bc it kills my stomach. with little remorse i m about to make myself purge. i feel like i saw red when i was eating and immediately was like no this is going to be painful to my stomach later . any comments? is this okay in a way. update: it s not okay. i do have remorse",
my ed has made me a bad person. i just need to share this amp; get it off my chest because no one knows amp; i am too ashamed to tell anyone. i ve been stealing food from stores probably about 3 worth of food day so i can binge amp; purge. i can hardly afford rent so there is no way i can afford to be symptomatic at the same time. i m scared i m going to be caught amp; arrested. i m scared i m going to be homeless. i m scared my family amp; friends will cut me out of their lives. i m at a complete loss amp; i m only 21. i m scared of myself amp; who i have become.,
"starting to peek out of the denial place. i ve been making myself sick for a few years now, usually after eating a larger portion or something unhealthy. it doesn t take much effort when i do it, and i haven t thought of it as an illness so far, because it just physically happens. i don t feel sick, but i just do it. so far i ve never told a soul, because although i ve completely normalised it, i know they would see that it s weird. i still feel like i can t quite admit that it s a real problem for me, except that i ve developed a paranoia about my teeth and now brush a bit too much. i ve been going to the gym recently, i don t hate it when i m there but its hard to motivate myself to actually go. so my boyfriend suggested i try his at home youtube work out, which included some exercises that i hadn t done before some awkward yoga type ones i really struggled and long story short became inconsolable because of the shame and frustration of not being able to finish the workout properly. i also got so defensive when he tried to encourage me. i have a habit of feeling upset when people want to discuss fitness, so i tend to avoid the subject. i m starting to remember all the shame and embarrassment of being bad at high school sports and remember my mum telling me i was getting fat and poking at me. i feel like i m starting to accept that my relationship with food and exercise is more intertwined and damaged than i thought. i have no idea what i m trying to do here, i just have no one in my life to admit this to or to figure it out with. i m worried i m so comfortable that i ll keep a terrible secret from someone i love and who would never keep secrets from me. i feel like if he found out he would be so hurt and confused. sorry, a lot of random stuff thrown together here. thanks for reading if you got this far.",
"my teeth are fucked .. i m so fucking mad at myself. purging is fucking up my teeth slowly but surely. i just got out of ed residential and have relapsed with binge purging since then. i never purged a ton before resi but i m purging more often now. my tooth enamel was already getting screwed up before, but now its getting worse. my teeth are chipping and my front bottom row of teeth are translucent. i dont know what to do to try to preserve them. someone here said to swish with baking soda water after a purge, and then brush. so i ve been doing that flossing and a restoring mouthwash my dentist recommended. any other tips??? i really really dont want to fuck up my teeth even more, but this disease is so fucking addicting and i cant stop purging .",

"none of the options i feel comfortable with are healthy but i need help . i came to work and they had a lot of leftovers from the potluck they had. i did overeat and as a consequence of that a did purge. this was planned. i do it every time we have the once a month cook off. i felt okay, relieved afterwards. but later that day when i came into work they had a lot of leftovers that have to be tossed if they aren t taken home. among it was salad. nothing triggered me but i just did it without care. i didn t want to eat earlier on in the day restricting because i new i was eating later like that s the trigger lmfao lying ass, any who.. fast forward to the dilemma: my worker talks a lot and i had binged around 9, purged halfway got interrupted and then me being my lovely little impatient self uwu binged moreee while she kept talking and she ended up staying till 11:4 pm now my food from the first purge is all acidic and burns really bad coming up literally feels like battery acid yay and for science reasons that slop comes up first. i stopped after getting maybe a quarter of what i consumed out. not because i couldn t continue or because i physically couldn t do it. but because i decided just to suck it up and take the f. now i m here drinking hot tea with half and half and wondering what to do to get out the cals. i allowed cream but i m questioning on why the fckkkkk but calmly and understandingly option one and the most rational: it s one meal it ll balance out and to still eat regularly tomorrow to avoid the next binge. a polite decline to this given where im at in recovery mentally i honestly just put this here cause ik it is an option even if i really don t fuckin like it omg option two: fall back on lax for a day. i like this one but then i ll have a whole container and it being their openly available isn t good for me so i was opting for maybe a single fiber brownie? but that idea makes me think it won t expel everything with just one. which will send me to binge on a whole box. fiber one i honestly like this option option three: exercise stay up another day straight and burn off cals by running and just say fuck you to my intestines since they hurt a lot after walking briskly for 17 2 mins. so i can go home earlier and get a lil sleep in before going into my night job. or a more rational take, burn off the cals by obsessively walking them off. obsessively walking an unknown amount of cals. i think you see why i m leaning towards the brownies as a person who is very sleep deprived. i guess this part is multiple smaller options like those answer choices with a. b. c. parts? i like those personally anywho, i could also makeup for today by casually non obsessively burning off cals on my off days sat sunday but then i ll restrict and not want to spend time with food related activities with friends and family :3 honestly i feel indifferent to this one since their annoying and trigger me but that s just for me and you to know lol thoughts? sorry if this is confusion ",

"1 month binge free. so, after my last post here in april, things went downhill pretty fast. after easter, i binged and didn t purge enough, which made me gain weight, 4 kgs to be exact. after that, i contacted a therapist and have been having online appointments in a 2 3 week basis. finally, i can say that i ve been feeling better and today marks my 1 month binge free. slowly i ve been eating forbidden foods and haven t been tracking my calories or focusing on dieting as much as i used to. however, although i do love not being constantly as obsessed with food and calories as i was, i also can t help but feel sad and frustrated for not dieting and not losing weight. i m scared that if i start tracking everything i eat i will relapse again. i have been at a steady weight, but it s still so much higher than it should be. do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this feeling? thank you in advance and everyone out there in recovery please stay strong edit: text formatting",

"why do i still feel like a failure. fruit for breakfast, small sandwich for lunch, celery stick for snack, and went out to a restaurant and got served a huge portion but only ate half and saved the rest. wanted to purge afterward but couldn t get away from family, then the feeling went away. then was tempted to bake a dessert or continue into a binge when i got home but didn t. feels like what most people here would call a successful day but i still feel like i failed and had too much to eat today. i m not sure if i m interested in recovery yet.",
"fucking relapse. i hate this. i hate it so much. i did so well for almost an entire year, and of course i had to massively relapse into binging in the middle of a heatwave. i feel so uncomfortable in my body. i don't want to start purging again, so i'm putting all my effort into not doing that. but it makes me feel awful. i'm gaining weight at an explosive rate and i can't bear to look at my body anymore. i almost cry whenever i see my reflection. my partner is super fit and while they're out kickboxing and living their life i binge on donuts and chocolate. it's so shameful that i want to dissppear.",
"first time in therapy thoughts. today i went to see a clinical psychologist and she told me i have bulimia with mood disorders depression and anxiety . this was my first time opening up to someone about my disordered eating and i just wanted to say i feel better now because i know i actually have this disorder instead of giving myself excuses laziness for binging and restricting fasting over exercising, and i know i m not alone. before, i also felt not sick enough for help because i don t purge, and i thought i was borderline bed. but this whole thing has just reinforced all the bad feelings about myself and basically consumed is consuming me. although the diagnosis isn t coming from a psychiatrist idk if this matters and i still am unhappy about the way i am, i feel better having this burden off my chest. i was worried about therapy at first but having done it once, it really is a good start to recovery and it makes you feel a bit more hopeful about your future praying for everyone ",
"seriously need help rn. hi everyone. this is my first time here and i just really need some help. i've had bulimia for nearly 2 years now, or that's how long i've noticed the symptoms, and i just don't know how to quit. i can't talk about it with anyone, not my family or my friends. they just wouldn't understand, especially my mom. my mom has bulimia, but she never talks about it and is constantly shoving food in my face even though i tell her i can't be around all of it. i just would really like someone to talk to and maybe have an accountability buddy or something. i just really need someone who understands this and who won't judge me. please feel free to dm me, i would love to talk thanks for listening if you read this far : ",
"it s like an addiction at this point. my road to recovery, albeit in its early stages, has had its ups and downs so far. saying good bye to constant weight checking and purging has been so hard. it s weirdly like losing a loved one, or a best friend. the one thing that i can control in my life, even if it s destroying me. it feels like going through the five stages of grief over and over, every single day. as sad as it sounds, i don t know who i would be without it anymore.",
"i hate being like this, but i hate the idea of not even more. tw posted from an alt because i just know this would break my boyfriend's heart. i relapsed after 2 incredibly close friends left me, and honestly, this is probably the most effective coping method i have. i hate it, because i had been clean from b amp;p for at least a year before this, but once everything happened, it just went downhill. ever since this happened almost 2 months now iirc , i've just been broken, and the stress has just amounted to a major relapse. i think the worst part about all of this, is the fact that one of the things that encourages me to, is that i think it'll make me more attractive to my boyfriend. i know it won't, he adores me as i am, and has routinely comments on how he loves my body but a very sick part of my mind is still convinced otherwise. i've been told i'm beautiful, i've been envied by those around me for my body, and i do believe i'm an incredibly attractive person, however none of that matters when it comes to the sick part of my brain that feels better when i see the number go lower.",
"question about medications. i m curious to know if anyone has had luck with any medications in their recovery. i m at the point where i don t really think therapy is helpful to me, but my addiction to bingeing and purging feels like something deeper than just a mental illness. i ve been diagnosed with add and a hormonal imbalance, previously, but am only currently taking spironolactone for my hormones. bingeing is my biggest issue and i think i could refrain from purging if i could get that side of it under control. i really hate being on any medication for fear of side effects but i m at a point where i feel like i ve tried everything and i just can t gain self control so something s gotta change. i appreciate any and all insight experience ",
why does my mom always make my bday about her?. my parents know i have an ed and i am recovering but i still struggle to eat in front of people sometimes. she keeps texting me wanting to have me over for dinner or cake or something. and i kindly suggested we just get our nails done or hang out in her backyard. but she says why don t you ever want to eat with us??? we don t have to go out but we can order in. after the millions of times i ve talked to my parents about my issues you d think they d understand. but she has to take everything as a stab against her. people should just be happy i am eating at all and not purging who cares if i have to eat alone as long as i m eating ,

"exercise abuse escalating trying to burn over 1k cals almost everyday. i ve been eating more and more sweets, like out of control, in a way i ve never been.. like i could always control my sweets intake until now.. and now to try to counteract the inevitable weight gain, i m trying to burn as many cals as possible as often as possible. the more i work out, the more garbage kind of stuff i binge on and it s become a cycle. i remember when 6 cals in 45 mins 4 5 days a week felt sufficient and enough as recently as last week.. but now unless i burn 1,1 cals and do 8 mins 4 5 days a week, i don t think it s good enough and i m not satisfied. i m worried this will only escalate. i ve considered turning to purging and dialing back on exercise but i hate throwing up and food costs a lot of money that i can t really justify just purging it all. i feel so nauseous like i could throw up, light headed and like a sense of feeling like i m going to pass out, with a lot of headaches and trouble thinking clearly. i m in the process of moving to la next month and i m in the entertainment industry as a model dancer actress so staying in shape is an absolutely critical part of my job. it s brutal and a lot to take on emotionally mentally in this industry. does anyone have any personal experience with this issue and any advice or just insight? i feel out of control with both eating and working out. i don t know what to make of this. thank you ",

mini success. i just binged 3rd time im 2 weeks so not too bad but i feel disgusting but didn't purge and eventhough i'm disappointed in myself it is still good that i didn't purge and i keep reminding myself of a small success: my face already looks better after 2 weeks if not purging i always thought purging didn't affect my face but now i can see that it did and even a friend noticed that my face looked vetter and asked if i used a gua sha because of it. so i am rhinking about that while trying nit to purge after this binge now,

does this count?. i ve recently started obsessing over calories and all that and have been limiting myself to not enough calories a day. by limiting myself i mean that i have like a snack to get to my goal calories then i eat dinner knowing i will throw up afterwards so i don t go over my goal. because i don t binge eat or anything i just eat like i used to at dinner but sometimes eat a bit more cause like i m hungry does it still count as bulimia?? also if i have something at the start of the day that has too many calories i will throw that up too so it doesn t count towards my intended total calories for the day. i am asking if it counts because i ve heard bulimic people throw up after every meal and stuff and like idk. : ,
bloating in recovery. after 4 years of bulimia with binging and purging everyday i ate normally without purging for 13 days now but i am so bloated that i just want to hide. i know my body needs time to regulate itself but does anyone have any advice on what could help with the bloating. i just feel uncomfortable and disgusting which doesnt help with recovery,

"not sure what to do. hello everyone. it has been a while since i made a post in this subreddit, and recovery for my gf 17 has been going great it has been almost 4 months without a b p and she has been doing very well. however, this past week, for whatever reason, her p rging urges have come back. one night, i dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p rge. the good part is that i was with her, so i literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. this is the moment where i realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery. tonight was no different than the other experiences shared. we ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to mcdonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the mcdonalds bathroom without telling me or anyone else and started attempting to forcing a purge. if i hadn't have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p rged. i have told her many times that this is a problem that i want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she b p especially that night where i had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half , and she knows that too. is there any recommendations that you guys have for recovery? it seems like she doesn't actually believe that it's a problem because its the 'first time in a while' but i know how relapses work and i know it will go right back to where we started if a relapse happens. she used to text me and ask for help and i would drop everything i was doing often even texting her while driving home, or dropping everything i'm doing to go to her house and spend time with her which seemed to help her a lot in her initial recovery journey. however, i feel like my effect on her and her ed has been cut down significantly to the point where she doesn't even listen to me anymore and i'm starting to feel like i'm not enough. she has expressed that she does not want therapy, but would be okay with it if it means that she recovers this happened in a conversation before the one we had today where she said that it is 'okay' to do what shes doing . maybe even like a bulimia support group where she can talk to other people in a similar situation to her? please help us with whatever you can she can read this post too thanks : ",

"bulimia is my normal and it's so hard to believe i can become anything else. having moved out, i'm now free to fuck up my life however i choose to and without oversight that has become a continuation of binging and purging every day, usually multiple times, spending usually around 2 per session and it's draining my bank account faster than i'd like to admit. i was underweight for a good portion of 2 21 but i've maintained a normal 'healthy' weight for quite a while now, almost a year. frankly my eating habits are all over the place, i've got a really bad snacking grazing pattern and the b p is frequent enough to fuck up anything. i lost weight b p'ing in the past but that was when i hardly ate outside of it. i can't do that now. my job is pretty physically demanding i work at a nursing home , and i just don't think i can restrict at all anymore. regardless the binging and purging continues. i have little drive in me to stop. it's impossible to imagine that i could. i don't know if i want to. it's a mortifying expensive terrible habit but i cannot picture a life without it, and the longer i continue this cycle the deeper i will dig myself into this hole. sometimes i feel like i'm managing ok despite the bulimia. im doing fine in school, i can do my job and i'm good at my job, i do basic cleaning and i take care of my dog, i am alive. but this existence feels so utterly empty amp; isolating. i don't know how many more days off i'll waste eating and puking alone in my room rather than spending time with my family, preserving the few friendships ive managed to have, or doing things i actually enjoy. this shit sucks so much. and of course it's all my fault i am this way so i really shouldn't complain but it still sucks and i have no one to talk to about it.",

"i gave myself gastroparesis after puking every meal for six years. idk, i guess this is a warning post. i had an endoscopy about a month ago and got the results about a week after. they confirmed my stomach is paralyzed, with moderate gastritis throughout my entire stomach colon. i ve been purging since 19, and i m 25 now. i would puke after every meal and b p for hours on the weekends, sometimes up to 2 times a day. i am prescribed ensures, reglan, and enough zofran for a cancer patient. my life is constant stomach pain and bloating. it s on the foreground of my mind all day how much my stomach hurts. i have since drastically reduced the amount i purge, but the damage has been done. the docs told me taking reglan gut motility stimulator will eventually lead to tremors, so i have that to look forward to as well. i m just sharing this because i want everyone to be careful. there can be lasting damage from this disease. i almost wish i would ve lost my teeth instead, at least i could get veneers. you can t get a new stomach. stay safe. i m open to questions.",
"i relapsed with a binge today and i forgot how painful it is after being b p free for two years. currently laying in bed but i can t even lay on my stomach like i prefer to when relaxing. i cried a lot, mainly because of the pain but also just the overwhelming emotions. i m wallowing in immense shame. i haven t binged in ages, and i am trying so hard not to purge. i forgot how hand in hand this is for me. i am well aware of my yellow light warning signs for relapse, but i think i got too confident in my ability to remain b p free and ignored them. now i ve slipped up. it also just sucks because i have chronic migraines and currently have one of those, too. so i m nauseous from binging and nauseous from the light, and my head is throbbing . i don t really know how to be kind to myself right now. i feel like i m in college again. positive vibes would be nice. maybe a virtual hug. some of your favorite distractions for when you feel so sick like this. whatever you got.",
"had a binge episode and almost purged but i didn't. i had a few sweet breads, a spoonful of ice cream, 4 oreos and ramen, not all at once but throughout the day. i'm 4'11 and i don't eat that much sweets so i'm feeling physically stuffed and also very guilty. i almost had a relapse but i put my toothbrush back and went back to what i was doing. i'm making my boyfriend a blt, my favorite sandwich, because he's coming back from work and we usually eat dinner together but since i felt the urge of throwing up, i decided to skip it. my reasoning for stopping was that i have been purge free for probably 3 months now, and not carrying the guilt of restarting the cycle is more important to me than a quick fix of my discomfort. also my bf has an addiction of his own and i felt like if i relapsed, i would be a hypocrite to try to make him hold his recovery.",

"how to get rid of the feeling . this is pretty much a vent i suppose. looking for solidarity among others who feel this way. i'm so tired of this cycle. i go through cycles of uncontrollable anxiety, feelings of losing control, then back to the severe restriction feeling like i'm in control but knowing it's bad thing. i just came out of a week straight of severe restriction. and yes i had a reason why i was extra depressed. i have custody of my daughter 2 and have to go a whole week away from her 2 times a year. no coparenting, he's a jerk, i can't know how my daughter is doing more than 2 times a week, etc. it triggered it and i barely ate. but oddly i felt in control of my eating. ever since i got her back, of course it made me happier. but my anxiety got the switch flipped in the opposite direction. now i have been battling for a week now this uncontrollable overwhelming feeling of anxiety where all i want to do is binge eat whatever i want. i gave up into it yesterday. i thought that maybe if i gave myself one day, it may chill out. then today it peaked. i ended up making myself throw up. i don't throw up a lot. of i do, once a day and i've never done more than 3 times a week. but i still don't like it and i hate the mental ish it does to me and how it makes me feel. my skin crawls till i just have to get it out. i feel like no matter how we do things differently that the demon in our brains probably is the same. how do you stop the feeling?? the never ending persistent nagging feeling of feeling out of control and that you have to do something binge purge or you'll go nuts i can't stand it. it makes me feel completely nuts. after i threw up i took a small dose xanax i'm prescribed for in the moment situations. i try to use them sparingly but i feel like this qualified... it didn't do the trick so i took one more an hour later. right now i'm just chilling on the couch finally leveled out and just wallowing in my feelings and feeling shitty. how and why am i plagued with this? how do you deal. why is binging even a thing? it makes zero sense and idk how wanting to eat a shit ton of food that's no good for you is so effing appealing and such a mind fkery.

"just posting a little of myself. maybe it ll help me?. i just wanted to post on here to kind of get it off my chest. i know community can help, so just doing this here. i m 3 m and i ve been b p for roughly 12years. it started after my first year of college when i saw pictures of myself and how much i had gained weight during that year. prior to college, i was in the best shape of my youth because of cross country and just eating better in general opting for salads vs greasy school lunch . in the summer between freshman and sophomore year of college, i started waking up every morning to go running. would make myself breakfast eggs and toast however, i was not satisfied with the lack of immediate results. i never thought i would have developed an ed, but my body dysmorphia really took a hold of me and slowly i started to purge, even after eating healthier meals of rice chicken veggie bowls. after a while, i started to purge multiple times day. when i came back to college for sophomore year, so many people were telling me how great i looked and it was nice hearing the affirmations of the work i was putting into my body. i think these affirmations exasperated my ed. starting college, i went back to my bad eating habits because i could just b p it later. it became consistently after each meal, then multiple times after each meal just to ensure i got every last bit of food back out. b p became constant to the point of doing it in my dorm while my roommates were out. at restaurants as long as they were single room stalls couldn t do it in shared rooms . and port o potties. after i moved in with my then partner, the shame embarrassment of them finding out helped me take about an 8mo break. but as i saw pictures of myself, that same feeling of woah, i let myself go came back and i went back into purging discreetly after each meal. i ve never told anyone, nor have my doctors dentists ever mentioned physical signs of the possibility of it. currently i m purging about once per day, typically after a heavy meal because i feel shitty heavy afterwards and i ve developed some sort of indigestion acid reflux which i m sure is as a result of b p . i am currently 6 2 and about 149lbs 63kg , which is pretty below average. hoping to one day be satisfied with my eating habits and body.",

"i m recovered but now food is so boring i have no appetite. the backstory is so long sorry u can read from further down tw last year i had an eating disorder. i have never met a healthcare professional about it, i ve never been diagnosed. i had some sort of osfed, purging disorder might be the most accurate if i had to put a name on it. i was obsessed with everything to do with food, i loved it but my one goal in life was to eat as little cals, burn as many cals as i could. tbh i didn t eat enough but never restricted as much as a rexie nor eat enough to call it a binge. i purged most times i ate something bad . i definitely had so much guilt and anxiety around food it was so exhausting. then, i started to gym and forced myself into this new obsession of getting strong, eating enough macros, new things that i could do to change my body. i always seem to need a new obsession to get rid of an old one. it was my way of recovery, i was developing the positive mindset of food while still focussing on my body. it was you need to eat at least protein, cals, or you re restricting eat lots of whatever and do not purge or you ll lose gains seems great, because it was undoing typical ed behaviour. but now that i think about it, i just wanted to be hyper fixated on something. it seemed like toxic positivity. that was a year ago in july 2 21. eventually, it started to be less about the food, more about the exercises. i genuinely enjoyed lifting weights, i missed being at the gym when i wasn t there. i feel as though this was my new obsession, moving on from food. ive noticed a pattern of becoming so interested in one thing, putting all my energy into it, then it fades and bores me greatly december january was my peak in loving gym because i knew heaps about it now. i considered myself fully recovered from ed. i didn t think about calories, i stopped counting them. i ate enough and guilt free, there was just no ed in my brain. maybe around march april i stopped being consistent bc i started losing motivation and love for gymming. it was just boring and repetitive. and bc now i was positive and ed free, i did not force myself to gym if i didn t want to. since the start of this year, i ve had phases of having no appetite. eg id lose my appetite for a few days, it comes back for 2 weeks. and the cycle repeats. but i just forced myself to eat anyway. i did not even consider it to be ed related i just thought it may be stress or something. today, i ve had no appetite for like 1 days so i go on a google search and all the causes of loss of appetite don t seem to match me. so i have a dig into my thoughts and i realise that recently i ve purposefully used this to not eat and i haven t forced myself to eat like usual. and i tracked it back, 11 days ago i zoned out eating cheesecake and thought about the calories in it and kind of freaked out but i still ate it and felt fine after. so that probably triggered this appetite loss. i ve realised i lose my appetite whenever i have an overly filling meal. i used love food, but now, i could not give less fucks about it. i don t enjoy it, eating feels like a chore. and too many foods seem unappetising. even when i find something i feel like eating, when i do, i realise it was overhyped in my mind. i just cant be bothered to eat. i caught myself thinking what if i just relapse it ll be so much easier this time. and i m physically hungry but just not eating bc might as well lose weight while i don t feel like eating . and right now, i have no obsession as i am bored of the gym. my mind is so confused. why am i losing my appetite whenever i feel fullness? how do i like food again? am i relapsing? is the appetite loss my fault? why do i need an obsession?",

i m jealous and i feel bad. recently i ve seen posts on here about purging in public and i feel jealous? i understand that it s not a thing i should be jealous of but for some reason i am. i m ashamed of it but it s true. i think it s because since i don t live on my own i can t openly purge whenever i d like. i ve considered going a couple city s away to purge in public so no one i know would see me and lying about being pregnant and feeling sick if anyone in the area were to ask. i know that seems completely out of the way but it s like a weird craving and i don t know how to cure it.,

"likelihood of someone passing away from bulimia?. is purging a true threat to life? i see so many people post on here that they are dealing with bulimia, so i guess my mind sees that and invalidates the dangers of bulimia. i throw up the most 3 times a week, but usually around 1 2 times a week. aren t most people who pass away purging multiple times a day?",

"recovery question: have you experienced exhaustion despite not purging or purging way less?. i used to binge and purge like 2 times a week at least for years. probably more. i genuinely didn't count and truly have no idea except that i spent about 8 95 a month on average on food. i'm taking my own approach to recovery which is cut down, there are days when i still just need to and i'm not going to attack myself for that,. make sure i'm meeting as many ""recommended"" dietary requirements as i can. just eating and downing water whenever i feel a bit too low vaguely set amount for the day but no specific meal sizing or times it's usually what you'd expect a healthy adult to eat, and not engaging in heavy physical activity although this is just time constraints and laziness . well i probably had my best week in like a decade. only twice in a week. and today i feel like crap. the whole week, i had decent sleep, went for a couple of strolls, ate electrolyte icy poles a couple of times. took vitamin d and iron, included carbs at least once a day. had my veggies, my tuna, eggs, my oats, my fruit, my calcium... i'm massively minimizing the junk food as it goes hand in hand with binging for me that's the only big difference. otherwise i had an mri scan that possibly took a lot out of me and a pretty massive commute four days straight. but i don't understand how i feel this bad when i'm eating so much better. i barely moved from the couch all day which is very unlike me to sit in one place for like ten hours and just get up to eat once in a while. i'm definitely not unwell. it's like muscle stiffness and brain fog.",

lax abuse. everytime i binge i end up purging with laxatives and i know it isn t good for me i ve seen the side effects that is has on my body but the problem isn t even how to stop abusing lax but rather how to stop my binges. it s a terrible feeling since i can literally sense when a binge is starting but i cant do anything about it. the regret is insufferable and even waiting for the lax to kick in makes me feel sick thinking about all the food in my stomach,
"new realization. i ve noticed that i won t eat with or around ppl anymore, if i can help it. i only want to eat alone. it s beyond just having a morsel of food just to shut ppl up. i genuinely only get an appetite, alone i ve been bulimic for 2 yrs amp; i m passed the point of eating regularly in front of ppl amp; sneaking to the restroom to purge now i basically fast until i can binge amp; purge privately",

"flipping between recovery and wanting to get worse but not being able to recover anyway. man i just want my brain to choose one, flipping between the two is literal mental torture i feel like my decision changes every hour. i haven t had my period in years, i ve maintained 43 45 kgs for ages now bmi 14 15 my teeth and literally so fucked for the past two or so years it s just been psych appointments, sleeping all day, scraping up money for binges and purging all night. no job, no friends, no school. yet somehow i m still clinging onto being underweight and having an bp as my identity. every time i ve tried to recover i end up binging even after eating 3 meals and snacks and keep it down because everyone tells me my body is starving so it s justified and i tell myself i m going all in most of the time i end up purging a little bit anyway. the only time i ve come close to recovery is when i was eating 15 cals and lying to my care team and maintaining my weight but that was even more torturous since i had to calculate everything so perfectly 6 times a day instead of just not eating at all and binging at night. i know the logical thing to do is to go to inpatient but that was hell as well. they pump you full of carbs and sugar and dump you once you re recovered despite being worse mentally. to top it up literally everyone knows i m bulimic now, word spread so quickly after someone i trusted told someone else. i just want to recover yet i don t yet i do. i m so scared of food and weight gain but i m so scared of losing all my teeth, i ve already lost everything else if i restrict i binge, if i eat i binge since i m recovering and my body is screaming for all the food and it s called reactive eating i wish i could just have breakfast lunch dinner and an ice cream but that ice cream turns to everything i craved during the day but couldn t eat.",

"guy im dating touching measuring me, says i need to work out more. ive been seeing this guy for about 3 months now. i usually dont get into relationships that often because my ed escalates x1 when im in them. i never have spoken about it to anybody really in my life though. 2nd date we were on he held my hand and was just innocently captivated at how small and boney my hands wrists were. i didnt mind that and to be honest felt good when we were comparing hands and mine were smaller. he verbally noticed when i only had two small bites of my burger. last date we were at this bar restaurant. he got a meal but i just had a bit of the appetizer. i notice he likes to touch me or my stuff a lot and i like that. so it wasnt out of the ordinary. but he grabbed my upper arm area and squeezed it and jiggled it a bit and said you need to work out more . i literally wanted to die right then and there but pretended to be unbothered and joked it off. i was already doing the usual restricting and purging beforehand, and it was bad to where i physically couldnt eat more than two bites without feeling sick, but feeling sick from starving too. but after that i slipped back right into the deep abyss. i was pretty laid back before this happening, and now im incredibly depressed and anxious all the time. i feel conflicted because i want to not care about it so bad. but i think about that all the time. and it creates a domino effect onto all the other times someone has made a comment or something. i like him and hanging out with him is super fun. so i dont want to be a downer. i dont want to say anything to make him think im a freak or damaged. but i want him to be more mindful of his comments on my body. maybe a subtle way to let him know? or maybe i just need some advice on how to live with them and not let them bother me. we are hanging out tomorrow for a longer time so im kind of nervous.",

back at it again.. i was a year clean from purging and binging. but i've smacked into a brick wall of my old personality and am smashing into it over and over again bringing back old habits. i feel so bad. my family and i just moved to a new neighborhood and due to that we haven't had time or electricity to cook homemade meals or healthy foods and have been eating out for weeks. i'm so scared to check the scale but i need too. i need to see if i've gained and if it's more then 1 lbs i will cry and do some stupid.,

"do i have bulimia?. my disorder eating really started during covid when i would binge copious amounts of food, im talking ordering 3 from a restaurant and eating it all, at some point it clicked in my head how much weight i had gained so i swiftly started restricting, decreasing the amount of cals were acceptable each month and for about 5 month that what i did i was practically starving myself near the end in my head i couldn t eat over 3 cals. i went on vacation, gained weight and that caused me to begin purging, at first it was with bigger meal but eventually i couldn t handle eating snacks i would purge anything bc i felt so guilty. i went over 6 month of purging daily, it became a habit it got to the point where i was purging in friends bathrooms, and a field on thanksgiving, it took over my life. but in jan i tried to stop bc i was literally abt to off myself and i have for the most part i still slip up and the option of purging is always in the back of my mind. now i m back to obsessing over calories and restrict my intake. anyways i don t know if it would be ana w purging or bulimia bc i used to binge like crazy but now my stomach can t handle copious amount of food, so recently i consider my binging eating thing after thing till i feel sick.",

"steps to recovery. i had my 1 year free of b p anniversary a week ago and a few people asked what my steps were to get where i am at. this is my personal journey and one size doesn t fit all but maybe one of these things could be helpful to someone. a little about me: i have had bulimia for 15 years and restrictive eating for 2 years before that. i started my eds when i was 11 and i am now about to be 29 years old. i grew up in a very abusive household and my way to cope with the trauma was through my eds. i never saw professional help for my eds but i will say that i started seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression almost 2 years ago. and that s what i wanted to highlight here today. bulimia is a coping strategy. b p is a way to deal with unresolved emotional trauma and for me, the breakthrough for my recovery was making the connection as to why i was doing what i was doing and then having someone acknowledge and validate my feelings. once i started talking about my trauma and pain i was able to start coping strategies that were healthy for me. my coping strategies that have helped me the most are: 1. journaling helps gets whatever you re feeling and thinking out of your head. 2. walking 3 minutes a day will help keep your mind and body healthy. 3. yoga calm body movements matched to the rhythm of your breathing is incredibly relaxing and healing. yoga with adrienne is my go to. 4. support system you need at least one person to lean on. i feel like my therapist is someone who i feel a lot of respect for and who i feel has my best interests at heart as well as my one good friend who also has my back. the first 3 things are apart of my daily routine. and the 4th thing is a few times a week. therapy is something that i thought wasn t obtainable. i had a handful of bad experiences with potential therapists in the past that made me almost give up on the idea. but once you find someone that you like, it s seriously life changing. my therapist is trained for aedp therapy which is short for accelerated experimental dynamic psychotherapy. it is talk therapy that aims to help people overcome trauma, loss or some other serious emotional challenges. from google haha. this is what i felt was the core of my recovery. recovery is a beautiful, yet painful and messy journey and i am so grateful that i am able to share my story with this community and i am so thankful for all of your love and support if anyone needs support, feel free to message me ",

"isolating myself because of my puffy face. this is going to sound silly, but i m severely depressed and stopped leaving the house because of my puffy face. it s to the point now where i avoid mirrors and i don t want to be around anyone, even family. i ve been bulimic for 12 years and i ve never looked this bad. i ve always had swollen chubby cheeks, but now it s swollen jowls. i didn t realize how bad it was until i had my picture taken beside my mom who is in her late 6 s, and my jowls look worse than hers. it looks like i have a literal turkey neck. i m a normal weight for my height and usually wear size , 2 or 4 in jeans depending on the brand. i m not large but because of my face, i look insanely overweight. this isn t even my body dysmorphia talking anymore, even my mom noticed my neck. she s not the type to say anything and she wanted to retake the photo because of how my head was tilted , but i know it was because of my big saggy turkey neck. the worst part of this all is that i know when i stop purging, my face goes back to normal within 1 days. i was looking at a picture of me with no makeup a while ago when i wasn t purging and i genuinely felt beautiful. now i feel disgusting with a full face of makeup and my hair done. i m not asking for tips on purging or anything eating disorder related. i just want to know if there is anything i can do to get rid of this swelling. i ve tried contouring to hide it but it just doesn t work. i stopped going out because of my swelling and even cancelled on important events. stopping purging is sadly not an option right now as it s my only coping mechanism, and my therapist and i are in the process of hopefully finding an ed specialist. guess i ll just be a swollen hermit for life because of this disease : ",

"tw hating on recovery amp; suicide thoughts. this is the worst type of eating disorder i can imagine ever going through. with anorexia you can at least still fit in your jeans even though the thought of looking in the mirror is killing you. bed has you knowing from the beginning that you'll never be your ideal distorted fucked up body type. but i feel like bulimia has given me hope, and i hate it so much. i've succeeded in reaching my goal weigh last year and it lasted for quite some time. i felt invincible, the whole world just seemed brighter and life didn't feel so unbearable. for me it was ""good enough"". i loved the way i looked and i felt amazing. i didn't wanna lose more weight, i just wanted to maintain it. but then i started to miss my period and i have the softest spot there is for kids and i really want to have one someday. i knew i had to stop, so i did. i also fucked up my teeth in the process so we had to give a lot of money to random dentists. the problem is that once i started to eat normally, you guessed it, i wasn't able to stop. i got back to where i started. none of my old jeans fit anymore, i feel my face getting fatter and it also shows, my beautiful legs have vanished, my arm tattoo looks like shit now and the outfits i once looked like a princess in make me look like a stuffed potato. i can't financially afford to buy a new wardrobe and i can't afford going back to my old habits because of the teeth problems that would come with them. i simply can't, my parents are barely getting by as it is. but the thought of staying like this is killing me. i can't stand looking in the mirror and i hate every single part of this recovery journey. i hurt physically when i eat, yet i still do it. mentally i've hit rock bottom. there's nothing left of me worth knowing. i can't form any new friendships or realtionships because my brain only thinks about how much i want to simply disappear. the point of this post is to vent and to tell you that if you somehow managed to not get lost just yet in this disorder, i'm begging you to please seek professional help. i don't want to discredit any other eating disorders because they are really not to be discredited . the false idea of hope that i felt for so long because of bulimia has literally messed me up beyond anything. i truly wish that all of you struggling with it get to live physically and metaphorically to see the day when you wake up and you feel even a tiny bit of peace within your soul.",

"bulimic partner. i've gotten into an amazing relationship these past months, she is an amazing person and someone whom i hold very dearly. our relationship happened completely spontaneously in a span of about two months of us two meeting for the first time, and we are doing great together. life has never looked brighter for me; yet i am still struggling with alcoholism, self harming, and suicidal thoughts. frankly, i feel selfish and disgusted by that fact, considering my life is going so great nowadays, i realize these issues don't go away instantly and that there are other factors, and i understand that my thoughts are in fact irrational, however, it's still hard not feeling like a selfish asshole considering the circumstances. my partner is bulimic, and it's extremely hard going through that with her. bulimia and self harm are deeply connected, so it isn't hard for me to sympathize, addiction like cravings and uncontrollable urges are the norm for both of us, disregarding the differing reasons. she believes she does not deserve the food that she eats, and she has a hard time controlling herself when eating, so she often eats large quantities of food in an extremely short time span and feels extremely guilty afterward, both mentally and physically in pain. i am lucky enough to be quite socially intelligent, so i know how to say things in a way that avoids backhanded compliments, triggering urges, and giving ideas, i know how to calm her down in most cases, however, that does not work so well when she isn't with me and is alone at home. for personal reasons we cannot in any shape or form attend therapy or a nutritionist, i have begun reading books about bulimia treatment and other related media in an attempt to be as helpful as i can. but this is so fucking tough, i am having a hard time helping her, i feel like i am losing the motivation to help the person i care about the most, and i feel so guilty and disgusting because of it. i want to keep helping her, i really do, but this is so hard, she deserves to feel good so much, she's such an amazing person, but i really don't know, i am lost here. if you'd be so kind, could you drop some advice? maybe hugs? thanks in advance everyone, i love y'all. first time posting here, hoping this follows the subreddit etiquette and such ",
"does anyone else purge to feel clean ?. i don t really purge for weight loss anymore, aside from self punishment, one of the main reasons i do it is to get my stomach to get that weirdly satisfying empty feeling. i can t really explain the feeling, it s like a slight euphoria? does anyone experience something similar?",
slipping back into old habits. general tw i ve been in recovery for over a year and a half now for anorexia with a purge subtype. i ve gained a fair amount of weight in this time and i ve noticed that lately i m slipping back into old habits. restriction calorie counting obsessive weighing purging. i m trying really hard to stay in recovery and so i definitely don t think i ve fully relapsed but my god i m exhausted of this shit lol. it s so much easier to give in to the habits then fight them. anyway just wanted to vent.,
"i feel a relapse coming on and im scared. i was purge free for almost an entire year until 3 last week when i finally caved in to the increasingly strong urges. i have a long history of purging, years worth, and my partner knows about this. relapsing would be a huge problem because they has a history of anorexia binge purge subtype and i can not risk triggering them, especially because ive been restricting and have lost an incredibly noticable amount of weight within a very short time span, so im sure that's not easy for them either. when i purged last week, i promised myself it would be the only time, just this once. but even during i was justifying it ""i'll only do it when they're asleep or not home."" right now i'm feeling the urge again, and it's so, so much harder to resist because i already gave in, and yall know this shit is addicting. i could really use some support and some advice if you have any : ",
"feel like the minority. my problem isn t necessarily purging, it s binge eating and then compensating with purging. i ve always been a chubby kid with a sweet tooth and it s followed me around to where i m at now at 19. if the binging wasn t happening, the purging in most cases would not occur either. to me it seems a majority of bulimics puke after a hardy meal rather than a full fledged binge. i do the latter and sometimes do not purge effectively and lose and gain the same 5lbs over and over and over again. unfortunately my current situation is tough, im financially cut off from parents, have to work while in a horrible bp cycle to afford rent, a large portion of my earnings go to comfort food. binging is a coping mechanism that makes my life harder tenfold. i m really tired. and this is yet another vent post out of many on this sub as it seems like there isn t much advice to give on our situations. sucks.",
"am i valid?. i dont know what eating disorder i have, but it's probably bulimia. i don't purge the normal way, i don't puke, i just don't swallow the food i eat. and my binges are the same. i genuinely don't know if this is valid or not.",
"should i go to the er. i have been restricting, some purging, abusing laxatives, etc. last night amp; this morning i took quite a bit of laxatives amp; my stomach has been in agony all day, i tried eating a little bit for relief but i m throwing up immediately without even effort. the laxatives must still be in effect because my stomach is aching. haven t drank hardly any fluids either.. last night i drank 4 cans of alcohol amp; that was it aside from a monster zero. idk what to do. probably not go cause everything will turn out fine.",
"i m leaning into my relapse.. for the past three days i ve been bingeing and purging. i don t want to get better: i know this because in order to do so i ll have to gain weight, and that is a hard no rn. i threw up three times yesterday. once was a reg meal, and i binged twice. my body is feeling weak. id like to think it s just growing pains 16f but i know that s not the case. i feel it in my wrists weakest and my legs where i usually lose weight first . it definitely could be paranoia but idk. i m not asking for advice because you can t rly advise people who yk won t take it, but i feel bad.",
i hit my weight goal and am not stopping... . there are always excuses... oh just lose the .6kg so it'll be an integral number don't eat so you can keep the numbers lose more weight so my bmi will be a round number too bruh i just want a cheese cake. and i don't even like cheese cakes ,
"numbers cw. ""just eat when you're hungry. your body knows."". for weeks now there has been a searing hot hellfire in my mind screaming at me to binge. it's not me. it's a fucking demon living inside my head telling me to eat everything in sight, telling me binging is the most important most urgent task 24 7. stabbing my mind, flaying me alive, it literally feels like my brain is on fire. and im whimpering in the corner, currently finally having a meltdown and admitting to myself how terrified i am of gaining weight. scale went from 131 to 134 and if it goes any higher i swear to god i'm just gonna fucking combust. i am terrified of gaining weight.",
"havent b p in a few days and im stressed out of ny mind. a lot of things have been happening but the big thing is that my eating has been irregular and weird. i feel miserably guilty when i enjoy food and i have binged or purged because of life stuff recently. im almost anxious to do it again, which is awful because im in the early stages of recovery. i want to cry and shout but i feel empty and b p makes me feel at least something. im so gross",
"little rant about something that doesn t help my ed. i 15f have rumination syndrome. ive struggled with it as long as i can remember. it usually occurs in infants, and children usually grown out of it. it took forever to get a diagnosis because it is unknown and i moved around a lot. i m gonna describe it for those who don t know and it s pretty gross so be warned pretty much after eating usually within an after 1 hour or 2 i spit up or regurgitate the food i just ate. it is caused by involuntary muscle contractions. it is different than acid reflux. for me, it causes bad breath, occasional tooth problems, and heartburn. its only cure is diaphragmatic breathing typically through behavioral therapy, but that is time consuming and expensive. it effects my eating disorder because it makes me want to purge more. i don t like it, so sometimes i d rather not eat. i d love to know if anyone else experiences this too. i rarely hear of people with rumination syndrome.",
"quit purging, but still struggling with binging?: . im pleased to say that today marks 1 year since i last purged :d i had been purging every day for about 4 years and by 2 2 i was down to maybe once a week, completely stopping last year. but i still binge so much? i understand this is normal when you first stop purging, but i binge super frequently i honestly still probably consume the same amount i was while purging and even if i don't binge i still feel out of control pretty much every time i eat. is a year a normal amount of time to still be feeling like this, with pretty much no progress? i'm trying to recover on my own so i don't really have a professional to advise me, or medication to help.",
y all do not ever take more than the recommended serving size of fucking laxatives. i m in legit sm fucking pain rn and all bc my dumbass decided to take 3 laxative pills with coffee and a monster on an empty stomach,
"i can not bring myself to talk to my therapist???. okay, so i have a therapist. and she's not like a bad therapist she's pretty nice and hasn't done or said anything outrageous to me. and my issue is that i genuinely try to open up to her. but i literally can not bring myself to like share my feelings and stuff to her?? like before my session i'm like okay i'm going to go in there and talk about my feelings and then she actually asks me about stuff and i freeze and deflect. and like i sort of feel bad for her. because she physically can not do her job because of me. and i actually want to recover, but whatever stupid thing is keeping me from talking to her is stopping me from letting her help me. but i actually don't know what to do?? it actually shocks me the stuff i freely share on reddit, because i would never say anything this personal to me out loud. but i don't know why?? it's not my therapist's fault, she's like the fifth therapist that i've struggled to open up to. she's actually been the most successful of all of them because i've at least admitted to her that i still purge sometimes. but i guess has anyone else ever been in this situation? what helped you feel comfortable talking about uncomfortable and embarrassing feelings irl? because i know this sounds really stupid but it's like when i try to talk about these things, my mind goes blank and i forget all my feelings, or my mouth just like, forms a mind of its own and constructs some sort of vague manipulation of the truth. so does anyone have advice over how they overcame a situation like this?? ps: i know i speak with a lot of privilege to have had access to like five therapists and still not talked to them. honestly part of what drove this post is that i know i'm wasting her time. i know i'm wasting money. so yes, i know that i'm extremely privileged to say this, and i'm trying to fix the situation. i just genuinely don't know how.",
binged and purged after a month. it didn t make me feel better about the commissions i was procrastinating. today i feel worse. i work in a customer service position where a lot of affluent people come in and treat me disrespectfully rude throw trash on my desk etc. i am not treated like a person of value. i called off yesterday because i thought i was going to be able to work on my stuff. i have never called off in the five months i ve been in this position. well i did work and also binged and purged. i went to sleep early dehydrated and feeling like absolute shit. just to come to this thankless job that i don t think will have any way to move up. i love art and creating but i need health insurance. i m just in a frustrating place right now i just want to go home but there s nothing physically wrong with me. i just mentally feel extremely low.,
oh i ll just have one a day.. . i felt like ass these past two weeks cause of everything i was having to put up with. it didn t help i wasn t eating because of how paranoid and stress i was. i broke up with me bf of two years insurance keeps giving me the run around. i was trying to get a personal dentist so i can start the second phase in my recovery since b p has wrecked havoc on my teeth. having someone to hold me accountable and constantly nag me on it would help me stay committed. personal issues keep coming up daily. i m dealing with a lot of unknowns as our lease is ending soon and we don t have a means to transport our things as none of my close family drives or owns a car. not to mention we don t even have a place acquired yet and we won t be able to afford a two bed room house theirs 4 of us and only two of us have jobs i blame myself for failing on account of impulsively stocking up on my safe sweets cause they were on discount while heavily restricting. hence the title of this rant lol i don t think i ll be purchasing my turkish delights any time soon since they re now a trigger food i m mad bro haha fml ughh i know i won t be getting back on track today but when it hits 12am it s a new day so . letsss goooo ,
is taking stimulants before after a meal a form of purging and restriction?. so yeah. i was looking for some advice. i usually either don t eat at all or if i do eat i tend to take amphetamines before to make my appetite smaller or after i don t know if taking it after does anything at all. i just have come to the realisation it s probably related.. i ve never been one to purge conventionally usually through overexercise but.. yeah. any opinions sound help,
fkn relapse agn ... tw. in our therapy group we get lunch together.. i played it off tht i was just sick but i can feel tht fear of just eatng in front of ppl agnz i cant take it i kno ive just lost 1 lbs aftr a stress period where i just wouldnt eat so its tooo much,
"im too scared talk to anyone irl, so rant. i m not really sure where i d post a rant like this, so correct me if i m wrong. i 15f struggle with body image issues, weight issues, and some sort of eating disorder. i ve had eating disorder thoughts for a really long time, and both subconsciously and consciously wished for one when i was in early middle school. i absolutely hate that, and it sounds so bad. i hate that younger me thought about things like that. ive grown up in a house where my parents were almost always trying to lose weight, and my mom often criticizes her body. i absolutely love my mom, and i don t think she realizes what she s done. i actually started acting on my thoughts sometime in 2 2 i think. the thing that broke me was my doctor questioning my weight gain. she thought i had a thyroid issue which was not the case. i was 5 7 ish and weighed 155 ish lbs at the time i ve tried working out and eat actually healthy, but i ve never had success. it s scary because i see my younger sister struggling with restricting her food. i don t want her to take after me, but she also constantly compares herself to my looks. recently, ive gained about 1 lbs which i ve been insecure about, and i was really trying to lose it in a healthy way. however, i read a comic that dealt with pretty heavy and realistic eating disorder depictions. i should ve listened to the trigger warnings, and just finished it another time. i ve relapsed started eating a lot less , and working out again. it s honestly really scary. i have band camp in a few weeks and i don t know what i m going to do. i m not sure this kind of post goes here, and i hope a explained myself in a way that doesn t sound crazy.",

"i m sitting on the floor of my bathroom. so here i am once again. sitting on the same bathroom floor i ve always sat at. in the same place every b p, s h and every attempt of mine has ever happened. after 6 months of successful bulimic recovery and 2 months after another failed attempt i still sit here and hope for some wisdom from some divine god like figure asking why i still feel so lonely. why the regular meals feel like binges and the friends i make feel like they re paid to laugh at my jokes like some hideous laugh track of my life. one of those laugh tracks that was made in the 7 s and all the people laughing are now dead. just empty hallow laughter. in these 6 months i kept myself so busy. busy enough to ignore the weight gain or weight loss, the dehydration and the healed up scars i can t bare to look at anymore. and yet still after 6 months of doing so fucking good i still want to do it. it sucks to never want to get better. to hope you ll get the call that a bed opened up at an eating disorder residential and you ll finally feel home again because you might finally feel sick enough. sick enough to meet the needs of your 1 year old selves sick bulimic fantasy. the one where you were fragile enough to be carried on the wind and everyone finally loved you because of how small you were and how they were all jealous. so here i am once again. sitting on the same bathroom floor i ve always sat at. and i can t help but wonder if going through it all over again is worth it. right now it feels worth it. i think i ll sit here and think this over for a little while.",
i need to recover with no support. i am a 19 year old living from paycheck to paycheck paying 9 a month for rent in brooklyn. as you may know bulimia is expensive. most of the money i make that doesn t go towards rent goes to b ps. i get nothing out of it. it s an emotional crutch a means of distraction from my self hatred. it messes with my functionality at work. i cant cultivate any thought anymore due to nutritional deficiency. literally cant remember what happened yesterday. and the worst part is that i ve been losing gaining the same 5 lbs over and over since the start of this year. ideal scenario would be going to a treatment facility and having my rent covered by someone for the month. oops forgot to mention that my parents cut me off and my only form of emotional and financial support broke up with me a few months back. so there we go i either have to recover on my own or commit suicide in a way where they won t find my hideous body. any suggestions on how i can start,

please help. are these real signs i should watch out for?. please let me know if this post isn t allowed i can delete it. i apologize if i say anything ignorant or misuse words i am not familiar with any of this and desperately seeking help for someone i love. i m concerned for my friend. she has a history of bulimia. she has been okay for a few years apparently and she typically eats anything and doesn t seem to think about calories or say or do anything alarming. i ve spent the weekend with her and noticed twice she went to the bathroom and had a video playing on her phone only 1st time and constantly running water and i could very faintly hear retching and spitting although not constantly so it was hard to tell. first time she came out and said she can t stop burping. i think she was covering for herself. second time she has been clearing her throat a lot after coming out of the bathroom. i am worried. are these typical signs of someone purging? how should i ask her if she s okay or needs help? i don t want her to feel bad if i misunderstood something. she is my best friend and i m sad and scared. thanks in advance,
"i think i might have bulimia . so since july 2 18, i ve been trying to lose weight. at first it started with me just doing it the healthy way. eating healthy and exercising. i lost a ton of weight. but slowly over time, it turned into me alternating between binging and restricting and sometimes even fasting. my therapists in the past have said that they believe i have a mixture of eating disorders and not just one. they called it ednos. these days, i eat healthy for the most part and exercise. but i tend to binge a lot. i ve been trying laxatives after having really big meals. i use senna tea. usually just one bag but sometimes i ll have two. it usually results in some bad stomach cramps which sucks but once i have a bowel movement, i feel much better and skinnier. yesterday i ate a lot of pizza. i was full but i couldn t stop eating. i took the laxative tea after. today my stomach is not feeling good which is making work kind of hard to do. i m getting really sick of being the weight i am and i m getting very desperate. i just want to be skinnier. why is it so hard to lose weight? why do i binge so much?",

"already put on clothes to go buy binge food, ended up going to city centre to chill instead . i've been struggling with bulimia a lot lately. with my other mental health issues, i have learned coping skills and how to look after myself when i feel things getting worse so proud of myself for that . but with bulimia, i don't know where this behaviour is stemming from and thus have not found ways to combat it. i'll be waiting for my turn at the cashier's with a basket full of shit and internally be screaming ""why am i doing this?? why can't i stop??"" i can't seem to be able to stop myself when the urge strikes, because the urge can last for hours if not days anyway. had a small victory today had the day off, thought about what to do. binging amp; purging is usually my answer.. so i was checking out store opening hours etc, preparing to go. but it felt so empty. so i decided i'll make my way to the city centre instead, see if any friends would want to hang out and if not, i'll enjoy my time alone so here i am, sitting on a park bench, drinking a nice ice coffee and feeling so much better than if i had done b amp;p. i'm enjoying just seeing amp; hearing the city life around me. i'll try to remember this the next time the urge strikes. to look after myself like i do with other issues, instead of giving in to the urge. 'aggressive empathy' has been my motto for some time, and i try to show that to myself and others. so yeah wanted to share and also this is good for me to put things into words every once and a while. sending aggressively empathetic vibes to everyone ",
what do you eat after you purge. i always feel like i should eat something to replenish some nutrients and feel less empty literally . i feel like oatmeal is good or maybe a banana. what do you guys do?,
update:binges are gone. i'm taking cinnamon extract pills with chromium and zink and the binges are completely gone. so happy ,
"how many of you had had it for 1 years?. i had it for about 4 years, purged every single day and mutiple times a day. wonder if doing it so many timea a day and getting it all up can equate to 1 years. i worry alot about esophageal cancer for this reason.",
"relapse?. i am visiting my dads family in north carolina and i purged for the first time in weeks last night. i am on my period with terrible cramps anyhow but my stomach feels all messed up again. i tried bingeing on healthy foods but i felt really big so i opted for the quick fix. it s almost the fourth of july and i m almost certain that this will happen again tomorrow. any preventative advice out there?? also, i hope you re doing well with food right now lt;3 also also, do i need to put the tag with an on my posts for them to stay up?",

"vomited a grey blob. hi i am a recovering bulimic of 15years, every time i purge in the toilet i pay attention my surroundings and to what comes out. so today i purged and what i saw come out was so weird. i don t think i ate anything that would give it that color or texture. it was a grey blob, with the consistency of what looked like a hairball but without the hair. like grey, mucus like and in the shape of a blob. idk how else to explain it. going to a doctor is out of the question as i m not looking to have everything documented by a doctor. does anyone have an idea what the blob might be or like why it came up like that? it s the first time i ve seen something like this in 15years. i m a little weirded out.",

"how to stop. hey guys, look for insight from people who have recovered how did you do it? the only way i know how is eating so much that i'm never hungry but then i gain so much weight and my self esteem plummets. stopped for about a month and now i'm in it again. i b p about every other day and can't seem to stop. do i need to binge and leave it in my body to start? is it possible to stopping b ping without gaining weight? i would definitely be a binge eater if i wasn't so worried about being fat, never been able to restrict. ugh. i just can't seem to find the motivation, if anything trying to stop makes it more intense. like, just sitting there with this overwhelming urge and the only relief is to eat. and it doesn't pass, it's just there, for hours, days. i feel like a prisoner.",

"just now fully understanding that i have an eating disorder.. i haven't b p enough to fully claim that ed. just random times when my anxiety gets too bad triggered and i binge. but i've only ever done it once in a day and never more than 3 times in a week. i recently had a bad one where i discovered how horrible lots of bread is to b p. so i looked to reddit and found this group. i already know i have body dismorphia and a fear of gaining weight. i have been reading posts and have now realized the extent of my ed. i was in a constant want to eat phase the last month or so. not hungry per say but i assumed it was my anxiety and i've tried to combat it. i always lose at night. when i really overdo it, is when i b p. realizing my truth seems to have flipped a switch in my brain. i'm back to the mode of losing weight as i've done in the past. zero urge to binge. but i finally realize this is part of my ed too. i'm restricting calories by barely eating. i'm eating just enough to not get sick or light headed. i feel a hunger pain right now and it doesn't bother me. i've already seen the scale drop 4lbs this week so far. as long as i maintain my weight and or can lose more, i know i won't purge. the purge only happens when there's weight gain and i feel out of control. i try to be moderately healthy and get some protein in. but last two days i haven't. i know this is bad but it's the only way i've ever been able to lose weight. i know i have a problem. but it's like i don't want to tell anyone in my life because i don't want to stop. i want to lose more weight.",

"it's becoming a serious problem for me. i'm vomitting into public parking spaces daily.. i just need somewhere to vent. i'm 22 year old guy and i've been struggling with anorexia and bulimia since i was 16. it feels more so an obsession with trying to be as attractive as possible. in hs i was in track, ate 3 calories a day like 3 days a week. i went to college and gained 3 lbs in a year because i was focused on school and not my body. i recently went on to gain 3 more over time later and it has torn my self confidence to shreds, but i wasn't nearly as bad as my days in high school. lately i've been slowing going back to my old obsession with my appearance, and just straight up only focused on my weight loss 16 hours a day. i lost 4 lbs in a year, and past few months have been non stop extreme restricting, bulimia. i just recently fasted for 6 days before breaking it out of exhaustion. right after that, yesterday and currently, i've been on a literal food binge when i'm ordering fast food in very large amounts. like most caloric items on the menu, forcefully barfing it out in an empty parking lot, then maybe an hour later i get a giant urge to do it again. i've had 4 fast food meals today i've forcefully barfed out to then later try to re feed myself. i feel terrible for it. i know its likely employees have to clean these parking lots. i'm constantly craving all day and i'm concerned for my body. i feel like i just completely broke my body and eating pattern for good. i constantly just want to eat giant quantities. i don't really know what to do or how to not be doing this.",

big meals or frequent snax. so i was raised in an ingredient household and we always had bigger meals 3 times a day but often no snacks in the house. when i see my friends i notice a lot of them eat smaller portions and snack quite a bit throughout the day. i have tried to adjust my eating to that of a snacked but i just can t deal with it and it usually leads me to a b p episode. the problem with not eating snacks is that i go long periods without eating because i am not hungry but i know this isn t good for blood sugar and i feel like i am missing out on all of the fun snack type foods. it s always the oreos and chips that make men binge. dae have this issue?,
"relationship between bulimia nervosa amp; beta thalassemia minor?. the goal of this post: to find people who might have had a similar story. i received a ""thalassemia pass"" where it was written that i was diagnosed with thalassemia minor, heterozygote b thalassemia. the reason why i bring up eating disorders. although i do have asian parents and the story with the genes sounds plausible, it's strange that they've only found out about this two weeks ago when they took my blood to the lab. i had my blood taken countless times before, so why did no one notice this then? the only other thing that is strange about me is my background with anorexia nervous amp; bulimia nervous. i always assumed my vitamin deficits were mainly caused by those two, they stabilized after i kind of recovered from them. suddenly hearing about ""thalassemia"" and not ""anemia"" as well as a ""shorter lifespan"" was somewhat unsettling. is it possible that the lab could have made a mistake? i'm male, so maybe they didn't think of any other explanation because eating disorders in males are rare. according to those medical documents, i have higher erythrocyte enzyme activity than the avg. of my age. the thalassemia beta was found chromatographically. i'll have my blood tested once again after i take in some vitamin supplements, i only have issues with iron and vitamin d3 it seems.",

"my ed got worse. my mum mentioned bulimia today.. hi, sorry for misspells as english is not my first language. i really don't know where to ask for help. i've had a binge eating disorder for years. my family doctor told me what it was two years ago. i started going to an ed recovery unit this month, my next visit is this tuesday. i've only seen the doctors there once. i'm gonna talk about sensitive topics. last week i binged at night, badly. i felt so bad, so dirty, i felt so much hate. i went to the bathroom and vomited. the next day i ate lunch. i felt sick. at night, i tried to eat dinner. i felt sick again, i couldn't take it, went to the toilet again. yesterday and today i ate too much. tried ""compensating"" for the calories by not eating for as long as i could and trying to vomit again. i've been doing the ""trying to make calories even"" for years. i will binge and then not eat, i never took it as fasting, i just would eat less or nothing for as many hours as i could. some times i exercised too. today, my mum said something along the lines of, imagine the drama if now i'm bulimic, with worry, of course , as i'm already in another therapy for a bunch of other stuff. i feel really guilty. sometimes i have to make myself eat or my mum won't want to eat either. i don't want to make her worry anymore. i feel like a failure that i suddenly got worse, i feel so much shame. i don't want to tell my doctors. i don't want to look at myself. i don't even want to open the window blinds to let light inside my room so i see less of me. i just wish the ground would swallow me and replace me with a healthy me. i don't know where to go from here. my mum supports me in everything but i'm so ashamed. i feel like the same little girl who was force fed at lunch in preschool and hid her pockets full of chewed and vomited food til she came home, the same little girl who was so underweight because she didn't want to eat. now i'm overweight. i never even considered bulimia and i'm so scared of hurting my mum but the shame is worse. if anyone reads this, i guess i just need someone to tell me i'm not crazy. for years i've been told by teachers, classmates, family and friends that i'm an attention seeker but the thing i want the least is attention. i don't wanna be seen as one again. i don't wanna be seen at all. thank you for reading me.",

"something that would have really helped me...your menstrual cycle, where you are in your cycle affects weight gain swelling and bloating. long read but worth it . i know bulimia is not exclusive to young women however a lot of people who have bulimia are young women and this is why education on the women's body and hormonal fluctuations is so important. as someone who used to struggle heavily with an ed. we are hyperaware and sometimes to the point of delusions of not even knowing what we look like, i used to body check, and weigh myself all the time everyday . however no one really told me that up to a week before your period you can gain 5 1 ""pounds"" usually from pms water holding in the body on the scale, that your breast and stomach can swell, and you can feel hungrier all because of hormones the woman's body is made to fluctuate and we have to be aware that our bodies are not going to be the same throughout the month, having pms symptoms and changes in your body is actually a sign of health so if you have an ed i strongly recommend tracking your cycle and learning normal symptoms of hormone fluctuations as your body goes through a cycle, your ""weight gain"" could just be very temporary symptom of being your on pms and will go away ",

"need help feeling normal. hello, sorry for the long read in advance . a little back story. i ve always been heavy set since i was a child because of some medicine i had to take as a kid. so it became very difficult for me to lose all the weight. growing up that never really bothered me. but in 2 18 after a bad relationship i decided to change and actually made it all the way down to ideal weight. but the thing is the way i was doing it was by starving myself, and going hard on the exercise. and people would praise me with every pound lost. they didn t know i was iron deficient, or that i was losing my hair or that i was sleeping so much cuz i barely ate. so my brain associated weight loss with praise from others. skip to when pandemic began and i was gaining weight and i m currently back to where i ve always been. but now i have this immense guilt when i eat anything, i feel like no one is going to accept me if i don t lose the weight again. i talked to my therapist and she said that having guilt when eating stuff like a cookie is normal for everyone and that if i lost weight the guilt would go away. and that i should even consider asking my doctor for medication to curb my appetite. and that i should count the calories of what i eat before i eat to see if i event should eat it. that s not what i was looking for in therapy. i don t think living with this food aversion and guilt is normal. but i also don t know if it might be mild ed. i was hoping my therapist would shed some light but she didn t. when i was sick i was at normal weight. and now that i m allowing myself to eat i am obese according to some bmi charts. i don t think it s normal to live with this aversion to food, with this immense guilt over every meal, every treat. help?",
"i'm so lost.. i was doing so good, i haven't b p in a month or so... i started again about a week ago though and it's so much worse this time than ever. but i'm losing weight so i don't know if i'll be able to stop now. i wish i wasn't like this. i hate doing this to myself but the voices keep telling me to, i have to, i'm doing ""so good"" with it and i'm losing weight. it's an accomplishment to me in some sick way and i hate that i love it.. i want to get better but i don't want to at the same time. i have a baby and fiance, i don't want this to ruin my life but it keeps telling me that it's doing me a favor... it has a voice of it's own and it's constantly yelling at me until i give in. i don't know what to do.",
"i m trying to understand. first of all absolutely no judge. i ve been binging and purging for many months now. i just can t stop thinking about, the only reason i m purging is because i m weak. like when you have bulimia, isn t it because we want to be skinny but don t have the will to eat healthy, so we binge, and then feel bad. i just feel weak, not like i have an illness. like i can t just loose the weight in the normal correct healthy way. i feel like i can t tell anyone i m going through this, because they will just think it s my own fault and something i m doing to myself, and not that i m sick. like girl just stop please. but then again the only reason i m not stopping is because i m actually loosing weight. can someone explain to me what is actually going on. why is it i can t just stop purging after every time i eat something? i hope this makes sense. i m just confused.",
"how bloated did you get when having bulimia?. i have alot of swelling. atleast i hope it's swelling. my body looks really really big. my stomach is hard as a rock and i am ashamed to go out in public because people will think i'm fat. i'm scared i've isorbed to many calories and that it's not swelling and could actually be fat and that scares me more then anything in the world... but i'm hoping it's just swelling.. : i look huge and i'm scared.. but i can still see the outline of the end of my ribs poking out under the ""swell"" so it gives me some hope that it's all just inflammation : my whole body aches after purging and i find it hard to walk the next day because of my fibrosis. i purge twice a day now. i've tried to stop multiple times with and without help and it's just so hard... .",
"i am scared. i joined a gym in february and lately i've been taking it seriously. it was a healthy coping mechanism that i got to help with my depression. but lately it's as if that one thing that made me feel better about myself has the complete opposite affect. i've always have self esteem issues and was always self contious about my body but lately every little flaw i see on myself bothers me. i especially obsess about the my cellulite on my legs and butt and the fat on my tummy. when i look at myself in the mirror i feel disgusted. i have always had an over eating problem but the other day i was just so depressed that i didn't have any appetite. the next day i relised i ate nothing the previous day and i was proud of myself because usually i would just constantly eat. the past few days ive been avoiding food and when i did give in i made myself.... get rid of it because i was ashamed and disappointed with myself. ive done this a few times not and when a lot comes out i'm happy because it's not in my body anymore but when nothing comes out i would start crying. my past few days have also been filled with me lashing out and just being miserable, constantly thinking of food. but as soon as i eat i feel the need to get rid of it. i told my friend a few days ago and yesterday we were at mcdonalds i went to the bathroom after my meal. i just finished and a worker walked in to check op on me which my friend sent. i felt so angry and betrayed even though i know she meant well. it's only been going on for about a week or so now but every day it's getting worse and worse and i don't know what to do. should i just wait and see if this blows over?",
"back to black. so i just finished highschool and i am on my summer break before starting my first year at college a whole nother issue regarding my ed . i also quit my job as a server at my local donut shop and i have not managed to find a new job. i also haven t been looking too hard for one as i wanted to use this summer to relax and rest after 12 long years of school before heading into another 4. however, this means i have more free time than i have ever had before. i am also now an adult and i am privileged enough to have a car i can use, which means i can do whatever i want whenever i want. i m sure you all know how challenging this can be as someone suffering with b p problems. i have moved away from the toughest part of my disorder and i no longer binge purge every single day. that being said i have had a couple of lapses lately due to being on my own for the majority of my day which is not something i m used to. i don t think that i want to get a job at this time because it is a little bit too late and my schedule is not reliable enough right now. and i try very hard to fill my time with things like reading and making art and hanging out with my friends and exercising but i still am left with so much time with myself. i feel like i am helpless when my thoughts start to turn towards binging and purging. i feel like a dog who knows that he s not supposed to climb on the couch, but cannot help himself when his owners leave the room. i was wondering if anyone else could relate and or share some ways that they moved away from immediately using bulimia behaviors when given the opportunity?",
"why am i just triggered all the time or am i over sensitive?. my work friend today was talking about food w me and asked if i was hungry or am i good with my energy drink. guess it was a joke about how i never eat..and i said no i m good. and she goes huh, ok yeah i guess it s just so weird how metabolisms work like our metabolisms must be really different. i have a super fast metabolism so i snack all day and i m good but i m like super skinny and lean and you have..softer features. and a different metabolism. so maybe that s why you re ok with just one meal a day? and i was just nodding and smiling as i usually do when people don t know i have an ed and i have the urge to scream at them ",
"dying while purging. this is my first time posting on reddit but i really dont know what to do, i'm just so scared of dying from this. context: i'm 16 and i've been b p for about 8 months now although i have struggled with eating for years , sometimes it's bad 3 times a day and sometimes it's mild, like 5 times a week for example. the fact is that lately i've been really scared to go into cardiac arrest or tear my esophagus stomach while throwing up and that has made it insanely hard for me to do so, while leaving me stressed. so basically i'm still binging but can't bring myself to purge anymore, it's went down to just 2 3 times a week. i've been doing a hell lot of research about dying while throwing up, but it's just showed me how to avoid a cardiac arrest. how does a stomach esophagus tear happen? can it just happen randomly? how are people who have suffered from bulimia for 1 years still alive? i hope i havent broke any rules by posting this but i'm not ready to stop and i'd like to at least limit the damage i'm doing, i'd appreciate any kind of answer. i do not think nor would i assume i have bulimia but i don't know where else to ask when it comes to this. thank you all ",
"how to keep a binge down?. my therapist recommended that i should try to keep binges down to at least get away from purging it s been way more detailed but just to get the gist of it . however, when i binge, i binge, and i m only finished when i cannot fit anymore food which usually makes me hurt so much i can t stand up straight and so nauseous that i purge just to get rid of that feeling without cals being on my mind. yes, i am scared of the cals but in those few minutes i just don t think of them but of how much it hurts . how am i supposed to keep down binges like that? it doesn t even feel physically possible",

moral support weight gain. i'm half in recovery and gaining weight and it's really bothering me. if i could just stick to my meal plan i'd be fine but i just have such epic binge urges...just looking for some reassurance and support.,
"little coping strategy i thought of years ago. figured maybe this might help other people. obviously we all struggle with body image, whenever i'm feeling down i think to myself that every part of my body only cares about me and keeping me alive. think of your body as an apartment building. all the tenants repair it and the landlord almost never has to do anything to fix it. when the roof is damaged after a storm, the tenants all go to repair it immediately as their 1 priority. the landlord doesnt even need to swing by. they are the best tenants ever and hardly ever ask anything of the landlord and instead just fix things that need fixing immediately before anything else gets done. they never procrastinate. now imagine the landlord comes by all the time with a sledgehammer and makes holes in the walls and kicks all the doors down. but as a tenant, they dont have any power. they know the landlord won't stop and isn't going to fix it. so they just go and repair the immediate mess and leave the other stuff on the backburner until they repair the most damaging mess first. but the landlord keeps damaging the building so often that the tenants can't keep up anymore. there are water leaks, broken pipes, an overgrown lawn, and weeds everywhere. but they don't have time to tend to those. they have to fix the landlord's damage first and don't have time to get to the other things. i think of my organs and blood cells as the tenants and myself as the landlord. and purging is the damage i'm causing. my organs work tirelessly 24 7 to keep me alive. i am lucky enough to be able bodied and not have chronic health issues. i have zero things wrong with my body. i have no reason to be mad at it. and yet here i am smashing windows and making my organs work twice as hard as they have to when they are already the best organs ever. and yet my organs still love me unconditionally and only care about repairing my body for me so i can live.",

"need advice on how to stay full satisfied. skip to last paragraph if you don't want to read backstory hi all, i'm looking for tips on how to feel full and satisfied after eating a meal. these days i have a terrible habit of binging and most of tbe time purging after because i feel so guilty. i have always struggled with my body image, especially because growing up i had multiple family members always telling me to watch what i eat and telling me that my portion sizes would make me the size of a house, or that i would end up like my mom, who is a little overweight yes they really would tell me that . at the time i didn't understand but in hindsight my portion sizes were not excessive and i had pleasure from food. but all of these nasty comments in combination with social media and societal standards deeply warped my perception of myself and food itself. eventually i found myself in love with the gym in highschool and ate very healthy a majority of the time and would still indulge in treats. my relationship with myself and food was finally reaching a healthy place, until circumstances pulled me away from the gym. it was heart wrenching to be away from what was my escape from the world and my problems. this, in addition to being in abusive relationships, led me down a dark path of food restriction. for an entire year i would limit myself to about 5 calories a day and nonstop caffiene, and would be fine eating a lollipop as a meal. it became almost impossible to even finish a breakfast biscuit from mcdonald's because i would get so full. this continued on into college with a slight progression of eating more. i tried to get back into the gym but was very discouraged because i had been out for so long it felt like starting at square one again. i was on and off with going to the gym as covid kept opening and shutting down the gym. i eventually found myself out of two abusive relationships and hitting the gym more often. i was tolerant of myself and even made the decision to finally get help for my mental health which i've struggled with all my life. however, once i started psych meds that all went through the window. i did okay for awhile but at one point i just absolutely spiraled and lost myself. all i did was smoke weed and feel sorry for myself because my life felt such a mess. i eventually put myself in a treatment facility and ""graduated"" with the self help tools i needed. but along the way, my relationship with food was obliterated. in combination with my psych meds which are notorious for crazy weight gain and now an insatiable desire to eat, and eat, and eat probably to make myself feel better i've gained at least 4 lbs in the span of 6 months. so now i feel even worse because i feel like i look like a bowling ball and my clothes are very hard to fit into. to make matters worse, people are commenting on my weight. which we all know is a big no no. even my nana told me ""you should stop eating or you're gonna get even fatter' i've been trying so hard to hold myself together because i literally hate myself and it seems like everyone else does to. i have never felt more ugly and unsatisfied with myself. so all in all, i know it's going to be hard to lose the weight i gained due to psych meds, while on psych meds. but i need a healthy way to lose the weight without purging. first step is to stop binging so i don't have to purge. therfore, does anyone have any tips on how to feel full and satisfied with the amount and type of food i'm eating??? i don't want to binge and purge, but i don't want to put myself back into the cycle of not eating at all. any help is greatly appreciated ",

"relapsed after moving to japan. hey everyone, i'm new to this group, sorry if this ends up being a long post but i guess i just want to vent and i'd love to speak to people who understand. i'm a 28 yr old girl and had problems with anorexia as a teenager. in my 2 s it transformed into bulimia which has been on and off for the past maybe 1 years. for the past maybe 5 years, it's not been a serious problem apart from the occasional one off relapse. for the past year before i came to japan i don't recall having a single episode. i moved to japan for work about a month ago. since then the bulimia has come back in a pretty bad way. i think the reason is a combination of stress from moving new job , plus i think the circumstances of being in japan have played a part: 1. amazing food is everywhere here, and so convenient. it's cheaper to eat out than to cook at home, and there are cheap restaurants everywhere and always open. i have lived in a hotel until recently and even now i don't have a fridge yet so perfect excuse to eat out all the time. i will maybe eat out somewhere on a whim, decided i ate too much and make a ""plan"" to b p, essentially restaurant hop have a bunch more food until i feel sick then find a nice private toilet to puke. which brings me to my second point.. 2. there are nice clean public toilets everywhere. no matter where i am i can easily find a nice toilet with a lot of privacy to purge in. means i also don't have to worry about making my toilet at home dirty. 3. there are convenience stores everywhere and all open 24 hours. i could decide to b p at 4am and get any kind of food i want from a store 2 mins walk away. all kinds of delicious ready made meals, sweets and cakes etc. also for example, if i have a big meal and feel full, even if it wasnt a planned b p, maybe i decide i ate too much, go and buy some ice cream and cake and milk, make myself fully stuffed and purge easily. plus, i now live alone, so i don't have anyone to hide it from. i'm still settling in and have a lot of worries and stress. my apartment is completely unfurnished still so it's quite depressing. i'm not b ping every day. i'm actively trying not to. but i'm gaining weight and it's hard to deal with. japanese people eat a lot and huge portions and never seem to gain weight. plus, i know japan has a reputation for healthy food but tbh a lot of the food is very high in carbs and oil. i hate this. i'm trying not to beat myself up too much and tell myself it's just stress but i don't know if it's gonna go away. overall i'm having a good time here. things are going well. but this is something dark lurking in the corner and i can't ignore it any more i should be enjoying all the amazing food here but this is making me unable to thank you for listening. if you have similar feelings i am happy to listen xxx edit: i should add that i studied in japan for a year at university, and it was a very bad year for me. this relapse has brought back vivid memories of how bad the bulimia was when i was here last, that i had completely blocked out. that year ended with a horrible s h episode, my mental health absolutely spiraled. i'm in a much better place now but i am also scared.",

"reindulging in bulimia with gym injury; please help.. hi everyone. i lost 5 kg almost 1 lbs over 2 years with clean eating and exercise everything from cardio to weights to yoga . i am strong, toned, flexible and very good looking 27y female now. i started on the bulimia path when i was losing weight and suddenly there would be a family party where i would be required to eat, or want to eat all the tasty cakes and fried things. i would then eat, and drink water coke alongside to make it all come up easier. i developed this as a habit, i would keep track of it and i was not indulging in this for more than 4 times a month. i thought i was ok. my weight came down, i was no longer morbidly obese. i got a good boyfriend. i am marrying him this year. i tried sharing this with him, but he saw it as a good way to eat and not gain weight and laughed at it until i told him how i am nursing my very own special ed and i should probably get help because by this time i was also scared at how i was becoming too reliant on this. coming to this week, i have puked my guts out every day for one meal a normal family meal, not more than 5 calories, no fried stuff, just everyday food because i have not been working out due to sciatica in my left leg. i cannot even walk more than 1 steps, i am getting physical therapy since a week but it will continue till this week and even then, i cannot work out at max capacity for two more weeks. i am scared. i am asking for help here. i have been trying to eat little as possible every day. i am scared the weight will come back and i will wake up 1 8 kg again, and all the love and adoration and compliments i received and continue to get from every one will once again disappear. i do not need preachers or sermons, i need a way out. any words would be appreciated. edit update thank you to everyone who replied. my pain is much better now after a week . doc has okayed some yoga and daily walks which i will be starting today. i still get jarring pain in my leg sometimes out of the blue so lifting and cardio is out of the picture probably for the rest of june. after i posted, i have refrained from purging. i compensated by having a low cal breakfast and then eating with my family for lunch, and a low key dinner again. this way i made room for food and didn t purge at all in the past 3 days tho i really wanted to esp since a gathering we had which involved fried food . so it s getting better. thank you all again.",

"writing an eating disorder memoir. hello, everyone i recently joined this subreddit, and i m already finding it helpful. eating disorders are so often shrouded in secrecy, so it helps to have a space to share stories and experiences. i struggled with anorexia as a child, after my mother died when i was eleven. i was in and out of hospitals and residential treatment, then in full recovery for a couple of years, then fell into a ten year cycle of binging and restricting that started in college. since becoming a mother six years ago, i ve done better in my recovery. i m farther along than i ever imagined i d be, but i still live with the disorder s imprints. i m in what i like to call the middle place that liminal space between sickness and full recovery. i m writing a memoir about my experiences, and though the book is primarily about my own story, i m also talking with others about their experiences so that i can broaden my scope of understanding. it s important to me to be mindful of the range of experiences that people face when struggling with, or in recovery from, an eating disorder. along these lines, i ve created a brief survey that i m sharing with people who have experienced eating disorders. the questions are optional, and the information will be kept confidential. i would love it if those of you in this group would be willing to fill it out. the link is here: http: shorturl.at mpce4 thanks so much for considering ",

"water retention in face. i know water retention, especially in the face, is really common with bulimia and i'm not new to this, but does anyone have any tips on how to deal with it ? it's got to the point where it's just painful, my face and head feel super congested so i get headaches and nausea all the time and it's really visible, especially at the back of my jaw just under my ears. i know the best way to fix it would be to stop purging, but does anyone know a way to alleviate it quickly or at least help with the pain. i'd really appreciate any replies, i'm struggling a lot today",

is the primary reason for bulimia fat loss. i have made myself sick on multiple occasions but not on the note that i want to be skinnier well not normally that reason but rather that i overeat then want to throw it all back up because it s unhealthy and i ll get problems by consuming that many calories and sugars is this a possible thing like is it still bulimia,

"if i disappear do you see me then?. i hope it is okay to post this on here.. ""but you do not look sick?"" well, you do not look like an idiot, but here we are kidding, heheh .. eating disorders are mental disorders, not cultural phenomena .. and unfortunately, i sincerely believe that, when most people hear the word eating disorder , images appear in the head of skinny and tired bodies .. and it is so sad, because it is so much more, there is so much more behind .. there are different types of eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, arphide, overeating disorder etc .. and no, you can not always see that you are sick .. it's not easy to see that i struggle with food .. i am ""normal weight"" whatever that means , and i have never been particularly thin .. i eat in expected situations, and i like to talk about how good the food is .. but; food is my weakness .. a love hate relationship .. i hate food. and i love food. .. i want to feel in control, which is the opposite of what i feel now .. but there is so much food does for me .. comfort, reward or punishment , distraction, anxiety suppressant and the intense emptiness inside me is filled , ""intoxication"", joy, pastime, if only for a little while .. ""it is good to see that you have such a good appetite"" .. well, food is not always pleasurable, but more like a compulsion .. a prison .. but because i might look a little bigger yes, quite true, but i'm built that way, and it's totally okay , no one suspects i'm struggling with food .. besides, i think as little as possible about myself myself, hoping to take up a little less space, and i think it works, because i am not seen .. i am so ""big"" that i am invisible .. often i think that, maybe if i had been as small as i feel me, then it would be easier, but no .. no matter how much i want help, our dear mental health care sees eating disorders as something physical .. all that is grilled in the head is weight and bmi .. ""you are not sick enough"", and hey we were back to not looks sick .. no, i do not look sick, but i will promise you that this disorder will soon suffocate me to death, it just does not seem .. the mental health care, system and all that; you have a long way to go .. sharpen up ",

"when your partner tells you a bulimia joke and you're bulimic yourself smiles through pain . so, my ex didn't know i was bulimic so i don't blame them for how insensitive the joke was but anyway there was 3 times they told me this same joke they were doing an impersonation of a comedian? about how it's good they don't have to worry about being a terrible cook since their girlfriend has bulimia and then the bit continued with different jokes not related to bulimia. the first time they told the joke doing the impersonation i was panicking inside because i didn't understand they were telling a joke and i thought they were talking about me and i got terrified that they somehow figured me out. the first time i just looked at them in confusion and laughed awkwardly because i was just glad they weren't actually saying that about me. the second and third time they told the same joke i told them to stop and that it was a terrible joke. though, now later i find the joke or rather the situation a bit funny. if only they knew who they were telling a bulimic gf joke to none of the people in my real life know about my bulimia so i can't really go sharing this story, but i thought some of you might find this interesting and ironic ",

"guilt, shame and blame for sos mod approved research post. hey everyone, as part of my doctoral thesis i've developed a questionnaire to shed some light on how guilt, shame and blame impacts the loved ones of someone with mental health needs. if you provide or know someone who provides informal mental health support and notice these emotions showing up in the relationship, i would really appreciate hearing from you. people who have completed the survey have reported finding the differences between guilt and shame insightful and highlighted how it helped them understand more about their emotional experience in the relationship. the whole survey takes around 15 2 minutes and after understanding more about your current emotional state, it goes through a range of scenarios to see how you would likely respond if it were to happen today. all answers are scales so there is minimal typing and it is mobile friendly. you can read more or access the study here: https: lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com jfe form sv 9awrvoywvpcqtu6 https: lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com jfe form sv 9awrvoywvpcqtu6 the person supported doesn't need a formal diagnosis but they need to have received professional input medication, therapy, etc for 6 months or more. the survey is available internationally and recognises all types of informal support, be it financial, practical or emotional. thanks everyone. we really value the input from the bulimia community as we know it tends to impact relationships in a unique way and so for us as researchers it is really important that these voices are heard. the project has ethical approval from the faculty of health and medicine at lancaster university.",

one day recovery. hi i have been struggling with bulimia for 4 years now. it started when i was about 3 pounds i went on a keto diet and due to the heavily restrictive diet i lost so much and the anxiety of gaining caused me to start purging the extra carbs. i ve been struggling ever since. i confessed to my partner about it and i m trying to hold myself accountable. i know it s only one day but i m trying to get through one day at a time.,
"i suspect my friend has bulimia. should i talk about this with them? how?. hi, everyone first of all, i would like to say i came close, but i never actually developed bulimia. all information i know is based on my perception of it based on what i read or used to want to do, and although i might understand some common feelings due to other mental health issues the inner guilt and shame, the whole ""i want to tell people, but i want nobody to know"" kind of thing , i have no direct experience to know for sure what living with bulimia is like. to sum everything up, i f22 suspect one of my friends m23 has bulimia. i don't want to be too triggering in a public post or risk being found out, but there are a lot of small behaviors that when are put together are causing me some concern. i'm not even sure if some of them are risk signs or if everything is just a bunch of coincidences and it's just some snowball effect of thinking there's a story where there actually isn't one. even if everyone is different, if someone would be willing to listen in private and tell me what they think based on their personal experience, it would really mean a lot to me. anyways, i'm not sure if i should discuss this issue with them. we're not best friends and don't spend much time together and we met only a few months ago, but i still care about him and he's still a person. if i happen to talk about it and it turns out to be false, then that's the best case scenario and i'm not too concerned with their reaction. what i'm afraid of is talking about it and it being true, even if he happens to lie and hide it from me which is okay is there anything i could say or not to make them feel welcomed and not too ashamed or guilty? should i even say something at all, since it's not something i can directly improve and could instead end making him feel self conscious, alone and overall worse? since he's a guy and it's rare to talk in media about the experiences of men with a eating disorder, and even if we're all human, i'm also a bit worried if there's something i should keep in mind while talking to him, or if this would affect his reaction because of fear of not being ""masculine"". sorry for the long post, thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read this and may you find the happiness and peace you deserve ",

"intuitive eating without restricting?. i ve had bulimia for a handful of years now; the peak of it was 2 2 . for about half of 2 21 i stopped purging with the help of an ed therapist, but at the beginning of 2 22, i started over again. something i ve noticed while i ve tried to recover is my urge to restrict certain foods and tell myself that i m eating healthy or clean. i want to be able to simply enjoy food and intuitively eat without being so structured, count calories, restrict certain things, etc. has anyone experienced this before? i ll go through weeks without purging, but in place of that, i ll be meticulously counting calories. it absolutely feels like a double edged sword. it s been a rough few months generally in life, so i ve been purging more than normal. i m desperate to lose weight, but i know that if i jump too far into the deep end, it won t be good for me or my recovery journey. any advice would appreciated.",
does someone know?. i ve had a very tough week . i binged the whole week which is why i purged the whole week . every single day . up to three times a day . just now i noticed something on my upper palate. it s circle lish dark red and painful when coming in contact with food . in addition to that my jaw only left side hurt the whole week and when eating or generally gulping hurts as hell . i ve never experienced sth like that tbh . so that s why i m asking . is it serious or will this pain eventually decrease as time goes on ? and btw i m not planning to purge tmr cause i ll be restricting ,

"need moral support advice. hello all, this is my very first reddit post and i wouldn t have imagined it to be about my eating disorder. this is nothing to be ashamed of as i know many people struggle with this as well, but i just need more advice and moral support. i ve been struggling with eating disorders for the past several years and it heightened this past year when i started to become bulimic. i would start binge eating and then feel extremely guilty, causing me to purge afterwards. i ve seen my mental and physical health deteriorate by isolating myself from everyone, refusing to go out and see people because of how disgusted i feel about myself, and self loathing in my own misery. i used to be super active and fit my whole life as i played sports in high school, but as i got older i started to take less care of my body and tried to fit into the societal beauty expectations of being extremely skinny. it didn t help that i was in a toxic relationship with a narcissist who body shamed me and completely destroyed my confidence as well. i go through faces of being extremely motivated by eating healthy and working out, but whenever i allow myself to have a treat or eat out with friends, i feel so so guilty afterwards and start to fall into that binge purge cycle again. i know this is more of a mental issue more than a physical issue itself, but i just need any words of affirmation right now. i feel really lost and hopeless.",

"should i quit vaping or purging. this sounds terrible i know but hear me out i need to quit both vaping and purging but i feel like i should be fighting one battle at a time. my vape died a couple days ago and i decided it was probably just time for me to quit so i didn t buy a new one. the problem is i m terrified of weight gain and convinced that vaping has sped up my metabolism preventing me from gaining much . i ve also heard of people gaining weight after quitting nic. so my purging frequency has ramped up since i haven t been vaping because i feel like if i stop both at the same time i m going to gain a lot of weight. so ig my logic is that if i m not vaping i need to purge and if i m not purging i should be vaping to cancel it out. so should i just buy another vape so i stop purging, then focus on quitting vaping? i feel like one has to be worse than other ",

"dental problems. i've been bulimic for about 4 years now, on and off, and no matter how many times i tried to stop, i'd end up relapsing. recently, i've been having dental issues, which i believe are the fault of my constant purging and bad dental habits. my latest binge has been sugar filled sweets and lots of diet soda to try and keep me full or help me purge. i started having a bad toothache, and didn't know what it was until i had to go for an emergency appointment at a clinic. at the most stressful time of my life, it turns out i had a badly decaying tooth. i know i have more dental issues because my teeth just don't feel right i cried in the dentist's office and i've been crying every day since i found out. i might have to get expensive procedures and more fillings, and there's even the possibility of having to get some of my teeth pulled. all of this would cut a big hole in my savings account. i didn't think i'd have to experience this so soon, but it was preventable and it is my fault. edit because i forgot to add: recently i've started to avoid eating because i'm scared i'll make it worse before i can get a proper checkup and water because the cold hurts the tooth they temporarily filled.",

"does body positivity, or even neutrality, actually fucking exist?. i ve been working with a dietitian who specializes in ed recovery for the past year. we often discuss haes, body neutrality, etc.. since starting treatment, i ve gained a significant amount of weight. i know this is normal, but i feel like i lost the purging aspect of my eating disorder and now im just straight up binge eating. i ve brought this up with her and she often challenges my mindset around food. she wants me to look at binge eating as a tool, and allow myself to eat and accept these body changes without judgement or guilt. but i can t. i m a year into this and i feel fucking disgusted with my body. i don t want to leave the house or see my friends family. when i was purging, i felt accomplished. i was starting to like my body. now i can t stand looking in the mirror. i feel so much worse than i did when i was purging. is there suppose to be a happy medium? i m glad i have a woke dietitian, but i feel like accepting my binge eating is killing me more than purging ever did. how the fuck do you achieve unconditional acceptance for a body you absolutely hate? i keep trusting the recovery process, believing my thinking will change. but how am i suppose to feel neutral about my body when i flinch every time i look in a mirror? it s not that i haven t tried. i really have. i would give anything to like the way i look. i thought recovery was about acceptance. not just abstaining from shoving fingers down your throat. so why does this feel like a step back. am i just incapable of liking myself? does anyone actually like their body in recovery? or do you just learn to accept the fact that you never will.",

"post bulimia, 5 years later.. in my early teens, my weight started bothering me. i wasn t getting the same attention from girls as my friends. they had never been as chubby as me, always lean and nimble. eventually, feelings of ineptitude and inferiority slowly simmered into self hatred. at around 14 or so i decided i d had enough, and worked my way towards losing weight the healthy way . i read up on nutrition science, exercised weekly and even started pt. progress was slow, but consistent; and eventually people had started to notice a positive change in both my appearance and mood. i felt athletic, and progressively built confidence. however, i couldn t help but notice how little the person i saw reflected in my mirror changed my love handles where too prominent, my jawline wasn t cut enough, my chest was too large, my arms where too chubby. kilo after kilo i dropped and yet something was always wrong. i thought that if the mirror lied than maybe the scale could be more trustworthy. i frankly became addicted to seeing that number trickle downward. i obsessed over every calorie. one day, during the summer vacation, i had eaten a little too much of a rich desert. i felt nauseous, sick. so i did something impulsive to make better. i stuck two fingers down my throat and i made myself puke. what shocked me was how easily it all came up. no gut wrenching tremor, no involuntary convulsions or tears. one second it was in my stomach, the next, spread out across a secluded bush behind the family house. from there my already fragile and obsessive relationship to food changed completely. what started off as a rare, last resort answer, became something i did nearly daily. it got to the point where i would ritualize the process, making sure to minimize the harshness of the acid reflux by timing the purge; drinking plenty of fluids after and even taking a teaspoon of honey to stabilize my glucose levels. it was almost as if this damage control helped mentally sway the guilt of what i was doing. by this point, i had gone from 1 6 kg, to around 73 in less than 1 year and half. having always been much taller than average, my skin had started to stretch thinly across my bones, my rib cage was for the first time fully visible. my spine could be felt through the fabric of my shirts. one time my mother hugged me and exclaimed that it was like embracing a sack of bones. another time, someone said i looked like a concentration camp inmate. the truly dark part about all this, is i still remember feeling a burning sense of pride and accomplishment in those moments. but the work was not done yet no my love handles where still too prominent, my jawline not cut chest too large, and arms too chubby. the person i saw in the mirror wasn t who i would later come to see in pictures, many years later. the reason i ve decided to write this is to show you that i ve been to the depths many still struggle with. to tell there is a way out, a light at the end of whatever tunnels you might be burrowing through. i made mistakes. i never told anyone about my binge and purge cycles. everyone i knew and loved just assumed i was just diligent in my nutritional programming. you don t need to make these same mistakes. talk to people you can trust, express to them your feelings which haunt you daily. because even if the road to recovery can be marked with relapse, sacrifice and even failure, nobody s fate is truly sealed. i changed my relationship to food. i changed my relationship to my body, and what strength and beauty it was capable of. through this process i discovered body building. today i m a healthy, 6 3 1 3 kg aspiring body builder, who hasn t purged in almost 3 years, and doesn t ever plan to again. my advice to all of you is to find something productive through which to catalyse and channel the thoughts and emotions which perpetuate your current situation. only you can know what form this will take, but always remember that it needs to come from you. no amount of therapy, medicine or even affection can fix what you are unwilling to change. be kind to yourself when you can, hard on yourself when you must, but don t curl up and accept your current situation.",
"just relapsed and need would appreciate some advice.... i have been a bulimic for 13 years now. i have not been able to recover completely and i'm at a point where i want to recover so badly. however, this post isn't so much about that. i was sick with covid these past 2 weeks and hardly ate. i feel much better today but i am also stressed out with job hunting and i relapsed today. i have this horrible horrible crippling anxiety and i am giving myself a migraine. this anxiety is from this awful uncontrollable urge to binge and purge again. it's in moments like this where i find myself having to ""pick my poison."" i want to binge purge, smoke a cigarette, have a gin and tonic, or an edible and boba. smoking a cigarette is usually the best alternative but i'm still having a hard time breathing from covid. if i have a gin and tonic i know i will definitely end up wasted but at least i won't binge purge? if i have an edible i just get the munchies and given my current state, not even being high out of my mind can prevent a binge purge. any advice is appreciated. sorry and thank you.",

"my boyfriend triggered a b p after almost making it 2 weeks free. i was purge free for almost 2 weeks. i had small episodes of eating too much but i would t classify those episodes as a formal binge . i was doing really good. my bf and i do long distance and we facetime a lot. facetiming him throughout the day has kept me from b p too which has been helpful. he doesn t know i struggle with bn, but it s nice that he s been able to unintentionally keep me on the right track but the other day i had a great day of eating right and i wasn t thinking about food too much. i was on facetime with him eating a bowl of cucumbers for dinner. literally a little bowl of cucumber salad with some other veggies. i went up for a second helping and he says that looks like a lot. you must be hungry i d be so full. oh wow you re going for more? i wanted to cry. i wasn t restricting that day but i wanted to eat in a slight caloric deficit. i already roughly pre calculated the calories for the day and two servings kept me well below my caloric goal. but hearing those comments made me spiral. i quickly said i had to go and went back to my room and ordered icecream. i binged about 4, cals and purged it 4 hours after eating so the calorie absorption set in already i just feel so angry with him. he likes skinny girls. he comments on my weight on occasion. he doesn t i feet and how detrimental that is to me and my psychology from now on, i think eating in recovery i need to do away from him. my friends and family don t comment on my portions plus the whole male validation thing is present when a boy is telling you to eat less. idk i just feel so angry. why tf would he say that to me? i blame him for killing my streak and dampening my self worth.",
"path to recovery. i apologize in advance for the long post, but i feel it is necessary to talk about it. i have been living with bulimia for almost 4 years now. ""trauma"" was the reason that made me ""develop"" bulimia. i believe bulimia is the way i ended up expressing depression. had great a childhood and life until the trauma happened around 24 yrs old . i considered myself to be ""normal"" before then. at my worst with bulimia, i started to lose connections with people that cared about me. it was a vicious cycle of isolation and b p. that went on for maybe 1 year i saw a turning point when i first looked for professional help at my university during my master's . that is when my mentality fully changed. i tried medication prozac , but a month into it, i threw it away. i had noticed that prozac was a quick fix, it helped me for a little while. over time, i needed higher and higher doses to sustain its effects. prozac helped, but it did not fix the root cause of my issues, thus i removed it from my system. a month after seeking help, i was hopeful and thought to myself that i would go back to being my normal self really soon. i hate to break to you, but you will never go back to normal. bulimia will be always in the background, even after recovery"". just embrace that reality, it will help you with your recovery. triggers intuitively, i started to take note of my triggers during my best periods. i have made everything i could to stay away from them. my triggers involve foods and environments. i live alone, i do not hold food in the bulky at home, and some foods i do not buy at all bc they really trigger me to binge. believe me, those foods are as basic as bread. i allow myself to have it when i am around friends family. binging and purging that has been wild. i went from a really aggressive binging mentality i do not care if i die to a lot of ""healthier"" type of binging purging. where i made sure i hydrated during and after it. nowadays, if i feel i will go binging, i have a ""set"" of foods that are easier on me during the process. i also, do not binge to my limit. sometimes, just the fact of purging something brings me relaxation and decreases my anxiety. minimalist food choices this has been a recent game changer. i was watching a youtube video from matt d'avela, nothing related to eating disorders. but at this specific episode i will leave the link at the end of this thread , he was talking about how he ate the same thing everyday bc because that decreases the stress associated with making food choices, and it speeds up the entire process. i loved the idea of these minimalistic food choices. sometime, deciding what to eat causes me great stress, bc i do not want to do something that drives me to a binge. using that approach, i have found a breakfast and dinner that has helped me greatly. those meals have a balanced combination of protein, carbs, and fat. they also provide me with quality and enough calories. it has been working for 2 weeks, so i will keep doing it and see what happens. exercise i have a troublesome relationship with exercise. it is almost a must at this point. any type of exercise helps, but there is an intensity and length i try to achieve. i also mix up exercises from biking hiking walking weight lifting. if i do not exercise for 2 days in a row, there is a serious issue. 3 days is a guarantee that shit will hit the fan behavior wise. facial massages post binge i do not like how my face gets all puffy after a binge. to prevent me from b p riding in the ""fuck it"" mentality, i massage my face the subsequent day's post binge. it helps me have the ""look"" that i enjoy and strengthens my spirits to avoid a binge. summary it has been a journey, honestly.... a lot longer than i thought it would be. it is much better than a year ago, but i still have a looooong way to go with recovery. by the way, the doctor i saw in college was the only help i sought throughout this process. i learned a lot on my own. honestly, i think talking with a psychologist is extremely helpful, but it is a luxury i cannot financially afford right now. if you are just starting your recovery journey, be advised it will take a long time, and it will not be easy. you have to be mindful of your choices foodwise and behavior wise drinking always leads to bingeing for me . hang in there because there is still hope. s2 link about the minimalist food choices gt; minimalist food choices https: youtu.be pnaraigkzjk ",

"feeling ugly and overweight after my first binge : . hello everyone. i'm new to this community, having bulimia starting after a very traumatic breakup. i'm a 19 year old girl that went from 14 pounds to 119 in a month, and in that month, my eating habits have been all over the place. the first week i hardly ate anything at all, estimated at maybe 4 6 calories a day because i simply could not force myself to eat. the following week was a little better, with my parents forcing me to at least eat a complete meal at the end of the day. but the third week was where the monitoring started. i was diagnosed with bulimia from a drop in nutrients and acute body dysmorphia because of my newly found insecurities with gaining back that weight. i'd start to look at old pictures of myself and cringe, then quickly compare how flat my stomach was to my old, healthy fat. with all these attributes on top of the breakup, i was miserable. still am. i then began dieting. up to 1 12 calories per day, with fatty acids and protein being the things that pushed me through. i cut carbs and sugars, because i figured those were the things that would hurt me. cut to a week later. i'm absolutely starving, 119 pounds now edging 118, and i'm at work trying not to have a breakdown because though i'm tiny i'm suffering. after work i buy cook out and binge on several items high in calories and fat. and now it's the next day and the guilt is eating me raw. i'm bloated, and feel as if i gained ten pounds, can't poop, and literally am on my bathroom floor crying. this is eating me away and i don't know how to handle it : tdlr; struggling after new diagnosis with bulimia",

"stress and impulse control and purging. hi, so i have been in a weird quasi recovered state for awhile. i am not tracking calories or actively trying to lose weight. i really have improved my relationship with food so much and i'm really proud of the progress i've made. however, the reason why i am not fully recovered is because sometimes i still b p. i used to p after i would eat at a restaurant or eat unsafe foods, but now i only do it when i'm really stressed anxious. for example, if i get in trouble at work or have a fight with a parent so, or lose my wallet lol just anything that stresses me out , i will go to the store, b a ton, and then p. it really is an emotional response that i cannot control rather than a ""oh i'm going to p because this food will make me gain weight"" type of thing like i used to do. when i was looking this up, i noticed that this kind of feeling seems more in line with bed behavior rather than an or bn. i guess the p part of it makes it bn though. has anyone else had the same experience please tell me i'm not alone . also, if you got over this, how did you? would pursuing some other kind of psych treatment adhd? anxiety? help?",

"lamenting. i ve had pretty disordered eating for a few years now, and i just wonder if i ll ever get to a point where i can just view my body normally again. i purge almost everything i ingest, i don t even need to force it anymore. i m at a point where my body automatically repels it without me having to do anything. i get this overwhelming sense of dread and stress in the time between eating and purging, i just can t bring myself to keep it down. i understand biology and my digestive system and i know intellectually that my disordered thinking is wrong but it s wired into me at this point. it s embarrassing how drastically my mood changes with how full or empty i feel i m tired of constantly feeling like i m getting fat. i don t know why it bothers me so much as i never thought of myself as a superficial person but it s become a real phobia out of nowhere. i just don t know man",
"i'm newly bulimic and i wish i'd never started. i've been anorexic for years and used to only eat a few times a week. but i picked up a bit of a drinking problem a few months ago and it always led to binge eating and massive regret the next day, especially when i kept seeing the number on the scale climb. i purged for the first time about a month ago. i was hungover one day and ended up eating more than usual. for some reason i decided to see if i could get it all back up because i felt horrible. next thing i know it's becoming routine. i have no idea why i thought it would be a good idea, i usually hate vomiting. for the past few weeks i've basically been doing it daily, even when i only have a small snack. i'm worried i won't be able to stop. i can't even seem to restrict well anymore because the hunger cravings come back too forcefully and the cycle just keeps repeating.",

"coping skills. so i know i won't sound crazy because i know people have likely dealt with what i'm about to talk about to some degree. it doesn't happen all the time, but after eating certain meals, such as calorie heavy or cheat meals, i hear those voices urging me on to go do the thing. best way to describe mine is imagine a bunch of drill sergeants surrounding you, yelling at you to go do it. what were some of your ways of pushing past it or drowning it out? stuff like that was easy for me to ignore and push past in person during my time in the army because i could physically see who was yelling at me, but internally is a different thing. any tips would greatly help.",

"non normative bulimia. does anyone else feel invalid in their bulimia because they don't present stereotypically? now, i fit the bulimia stereotype at some points, as given by the dsm v. but when not looking at me physically, it doesn't seem like i have bulimia at all. i don't tend to purge through normal means and it makes me feel like shit. i know that it's bulimia because it's defined by the goddamn dsm v but i still feel fake because i'm not what people think of as bulimic. i don't tend to purge through vomitting often. my emetophobia fear of throwing up is pretty severe, so it's an additional layer of hell when i do vomit, on top of the normal shitty feeling of making yourself puke. i get really shivery and scared when i do it, and it's not something i can do often. i don't use lax due to a pretty traumatic medical history long story short, i don't trust any sort of pills. nor do i want to shit myself in public, which keeps me from using lax teas 'n' shit. most of my purging is in the form of fasting and over exercise. i'll not eat for days or hours, until i inevitably binge again. i'll work myself to feeling faint and almost deathly which isn't hard, since i'm chronically ill and then i'll work myself some more. i don't see a lot of people online talking about this sort of bulimia purging through exessive fasting or exercise. i know it's purging as defined by the dsm v, but i still feel like i'm faking it, like i'm not sick enough. and when i do find people talking about comp exercise it's usually gym bros, whom i struggle to relate to. i also binge way more than i purge. i can binge like 4 5 times a week and purge like 3 4 times. i just feel fake and i hate it. does anyone else present like this? i just want to know that i'm not alone. thanks lt;3",

trying to cope. i ve been struggling recently with what i think might be an ed i exhibit both behaviours of an anorexic and someone with bulimia and my family has become rather suspicious. this morning we went out to food and me not eating eating very low calories said i wasn t hungry and that i felt sick but family kept saying i was trying to give myself an eating disorder which is the last thing i would do but then saying this makes it harder for me to get help. it s obvious how they feel about eating disorders and so it makes me uncomfortable to even think about going to one of them for help. i don t know this made me really mad and so sad and a lot of things and it s feeling as if they re downplaying my experiences but fair play they don t actually understand.,

"dae focus on total purging days in each month when it comes to recovery instead of how many days you went without purging?. i can t stop cold turkey plus making sure i keep the streak going is too stressful because i end up feeling extremely discouraged when i give in which leads to a fuck it attitude and going all in for the rest of the week. instead, what i do is make sure each month i purged less days than the month before. so on march when i decided to recover, i purged 11 days out of 31 but april was a bad month for me so i purged 19 days out of 3 . however i tried really hard on may and again purged 11 days out of 31 which is a success. if i purged even 1 day less on june so 1 days total , then i ll consider it a success as well cuz it s progress.",
why does every attempt to recover fail?. i m so frustrated and depressed. i have many days that i try to restrict my food intake in order to lose weight. then i see something or read something or suddenly feel super fine with the way i look that day and this thought pops up what if i just allowed myself to eat like a normal person or if i allow myself to eat x i will be one step closer to recovering or i should just eat whatever i want because that s what ppl in recovery should do but then allll these instances which happen with the best intentions always turn into a binge which turns into a purge and followed by weight gain and the entire cycle happens alllll over again. i just feel like it is impossible for me to recover because i m terrified to lose weight and i am pretty sure i will never achieve a normal relationship with food : how do people do this? pls help,
