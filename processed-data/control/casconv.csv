"i'm influencing my friends and coworkers into saying 'skedaddle' and this is the most powerful i have ever felt lol. basically title. i like to say ""childish"" catchphrases for a number of reasons, mainly being that i find it slightly funny to see people react to a grown woman looking them in the eye and saying ""okie dokie"" and there are just so many fun words out there that dont get used enough. recently ive noticed both friends and coworkers telling me they have to 'skedaddle' and its the best thing i have ever seen. i am slowly introducing 'skedaddle' to the adult vernacular. this is the mark i choose to leave on this planet.",2
"i'm about to go on a long solo trip and not one family member supports it. i'm 22f, european and i've been dreaming for years to go to south east asia. i've finally the time and the money to do it so that's it, i'll be spending 1 weeks travelling, six countries, all flights booked. it's a dream coming true and it's not even like the first time i've so stuff by myself. i've lived abroad, did a couple short solo trips. not one single person in my family seems happy about it. i'm too young, too female, too sure of myself and above all too selfish, for how dare i make my parents worry so long about me. i'm just so done. i can't wait to put an ocean between me and them.",2
"it's crazy how life turns out.. in sixth grade, i met the guy who's my current best friend, and it's insane to me the way that worked out. so, you have me, a black guy from the backstreets of queens, ny, who moved down south when he was five, and a white dude born and raised in the south, and we just so happened to be in the same school, at the same time, in the same class, and one day i overhear him talking about video games, and i ask him for his gamertag, and we find out we're two halves of one whole dumbass. and now all these years later, here we are. best of friends. big chillin. in his house. showing each other shitposts we find around the internet. while i'm casually holding his new authentic lee enfield that some poor old british bastard used to snipe nazis in wwii. life takes you weird places",2
"what does your username mean?. i wanted to ask, what kind of meaning, reddit people has your username? how did you get with the idea, to write and to be your forever username? i made some mistakes in the typing of my username, as far as i read, there's no chance you can change it...",2
"i told my little cousin i was dating his favourite teacher and his reaction was adorable. context: i'm 21m, teacher is 22f, and cousin is 5m. almost two weeks ago i dropped him off at kindergarten orientation class because his parents were unexpectedly busy that morning. after helping him get his stuff into his cubby i was about to leave when he wanted to introduce me to the ""best girl teacher ever""...boy was he right about that title. stuff happened in between everything and eventually her and i started going out. i have never been in a relationship that has progressed as fast as this one has. in just a span of two weeks she went from being a gorgeous stranger to reminding my forgetful ass to take my adhd and vitamin b12 pills in the morning . not even my lovely parents do that which totally fair. after suffering from recent heartbreak, the death of my grandmother, and suicide of a high school friend, she's been the equation in my life i've so dearly needed in 2 22. just yesterday she sat down with me while i had a much needed, disgusting and overdue bawling session that i was not comfortable having with either my friends of parents. i felt like a baby but fuck was it necessary. we share the same sense of humour, enjoy similar movies, have nearly identical spotify playlists, bond over the same childhood nostalgia. and not only that but she runs her own part time photography gig which has literally been a goal of mine for years. i have literally found the female version of myself. all on top of that she looks like audrey hepburn so you cannot go wrong with that. it makes complete sense that this person would work with and educate little children. not many people have the patience and maturity for that and i totally see why my cousin likes her so much. enough of that. i was always nervous about the whole thing because my cousin looks up to her as his second mother. he literally calls her ""mrs mother"" for crying out loud . he sees me as the brother he never had and as a result i was overthinking stuff and worried that he would take it the wrong way or feel weird about it. don't blame me if this sounds like i'm freaking out over nothing, the last time i was 5 the iphone didn't even exist and gerald ford was still alive, that's how long ago it was. i completely forgot how blissfully unaware of anything complex people that age are. after talking to her about it as well my friends and some strangers online, interestingly enough, we both decided that today we'd ""come clean"" to him at the end of the day that his ""brother and mother"" literally how he describes us were k i s s i n g. i dreaded it the entire day during work and on the drive to pick him up but after finally pushing myself, she yes she, not we lol i was too scared and she decided to get it over with told him word for word ""your bhai brother in my bengali language, which she is also learning and i are boyfriend girlfriend"". to my absolute relief the kid lets out the biggest smile i think i've ever seen from him. he's literally speechless. i ask him what he thinks about it and all he does is jump up and down while laughing and clapping and then runs up to us for a hug. his two favourite people yes he told me that as well found happiness in each other. it was the cutest thing i've seen in ages. even hours later i called his mom and he's still jumping on his bed and calling her ""mrs sister"" . made me realize he's basically just a big baby and i wouldn't have it any other way. sorry if this sounds completely random to you but i've been telling everyone i know this so far so might as well fill in the internet strangers who also helped me come to my senses and realize i was overreacting as usual.",2
"i love semicolons. i saw this completely random reddit comment a while ago, probably in a r askreddit thread, that said semicolons are underrated as fuck. honestly, they are i work in customer support and they are so nice at breaking up a long explanation; especially if you re trying to keep the same energy and don t wanna just use commas. i used to use them religiously but i found semicolons work better in a lot of situations. i don t know who needs to hear this but incorporate semicolons in your life. edit: the post is complete; semicolon added y all i know it s wrong it s for the sake of semicolons, it was a comma ",2
"man i could really use a hug rn.. its one of those days where i just wanna hug someone and cry. i wanna cry into someone's arm so badly. i don't have anyone to hug and it kinda sucks. i used to have long distance gf, so no physical affection. i was always jealous of bormal couples who could hug, kiss and cuddle. that was just me being toxic but a part of me really wanted it. it doesn't bother me that much but from time to time, i just wanna fall apart to someone without feeling judged. but that's just wishful thinking.",2
"what are simple things that make you happy?. what are the simplest things in life that make you smile? for me it's rainbows, fireworks, bubbles, receiving random pics from friends, seeing someone wear a shirt from a lesser known fandom i'm a part of. would love to hear yours. what makes you smile?",2
"i ran 1.5 miles . 1.2 22 i was diagnosed with covid it was bad. 3 months on my back, i now limp when i walk, joint pain, etc. my dr cleared me to start more cardio than walking and after running i can t stop smiling at the progress ",2
"the song dear mama by tupac hits too hard and made me cry happy tears. the lyrics, the vibe and the beat pretty much made me reminisce about my childhood. for some reasons it made me compare who i am today vs me in the past and to be honest i feel bittersweet about it. i don't know how to explain it. but i felt a mix of happiness and sadness. to those who see these, thanks for reading this post about me venting about what i was feeling.",2
"what kind of car do you drive and how are you doing today?. that's pretty much all i have to ask. i love cars not even just fancy ones i just like watching cars go by and being able to tell what they are, but i don't have many people to talk to at the moment. i'm doing okay and i drive a 2 6 honda civic ",2
"i love blocking toxic people on reddit. you should try it . there are a lot of people here who engage in conversations in bad faith or on topics they have no reason to be discussing while pretending their point is the only one worth ever bringing up. when you see someone who says something so obviously dumb, inappropriate, or just completely unnecessary for the conversation and is obviously meant to derail it in some way then just block them you'll never have to see their stupidity again and your life will be better for it. reddit is a cesspool and you have to scrape the muck off your boots every once in a while.",2
"my cat won t shut up, so hello.. my newly adopted kitten is simultaneously very people shy and very feline social. i don t want to let her and my older cat jinx interact unsupervised, so the new kitty luna is being very loud right now because she feels very alone. i m not good enough company for luna, at least not right now and that makes sense i wouldn t trust a stranger i met four hours ago either. so i m trying to sleep but will most likely fail, since she s so vocal about her situation. what s keeping you up tonight?",2
"i miss random, casual connections.. for a large part of my life, i feel like a could end up in a spot a bar, concert, whatever event, just some thing and have an interaction with someone. i'm fairly introverted, but socialable, and connect with people well. i have close friends. but, in a way, i value the interactions i spontaneously have with strangers or aquiantsnces more. i'd go to a bar, a busy bar, drink alone i like being alone with my thoughts and end up idly quiping with a patron or bartender. passive, but passes the time, and feels good. that happens less than it used to. maybe i'm getting too old, or my demear has changed, or the world is different and everyone keeps to themselves. i don't know. i'm 33, in chicago, and am craving that. but, everything seems so different. i'm not sure what i'm trying to say, but i hope someone gets it. take care, all.",2
i feel so blessed to be alive. i just celebrated my birthday on the 16th i had a surprise birthday party for my 28th i didn't know about it and felt really touched by this kind gesture i got so many gifts that i actually did need sometimes did not realize it but i am glad to be healthy and happy and very blessed to have co workers that care about me thank you for reading.,2
"does anyone else imagine living in a village somewhere with all your friends and family and just living a care free existence?. been thinking about it a lot, moving my friends from all over the place to some quaint village near the sea where we can all be together and just live out our lives without having too much to worry about with money or jobs or stress, fishing and swimming and just enjoying life. obviously not realistic, but its nice to think about. what's your day dreaming life like? what do you like to imagine?",2
"idk anything anymore. for the past couple of days i've been feeling gloomy and depressed, and i've started to feel like majority of people i know in person either used me or never cared for me, some people would disagree with me or lie to me, like a friend tried to guilt trip me saying ""i held that contraband when you didn't want to get i.d'd"" even though i never take anything bad outside my house. i would like to meet new people but i'm shy and i feel like i am weird myself, idk what to do and if anyone does read this than thank you for putting your time into a lonely person. love you redditors",2
i wonder what its like to perform your own songs live as an artist. it must be such a rush being a music artist and performing your own music and having the crowd go nuts with the first few seconds of an intro to a song they legit know every word to. i d love to know what that feels like to the people who actually grind to success and then reap the rewards. the definition of you made it. having the crowd scream simply from the intro to each song. thats how hyped they are. must feel crazy,2
"jamie foxx is one of the best entertainers ever.. this dude does not cease to amaze me. everything he does he s good at. his music, acting, his comedy is fucking hilarious. an entertainment legend.",2
"stressed about going back to work in a few weeks. so first off i'm a college student who's home for the summer. i have a pretty sweet on campus job, but right before the second semester ended we hired a ""problem"" employee who's just been a real pain in the ass for everybody. it also doesn't help me and him are the only one who aren't seniors, so we were the only people who didn't graduate. the other guy is sexist, gets into a lot of fights online me and him are in the same discord and kinda openly dislikes me for a number of reasons. he also just doesn't do work. i know he's gonna be fired as soon as we get new hires, but even then i'm still gonna have to train 5 7 new people pretty much all by myself. it wasn't so bad when i joined up, as it was 5 people training just me. and if he isn't fired, then not only will i have to train people by myself since he doesn't do his job, i'll probably have to facilitate things and try and keep things civil if my manager happens to hire any women. i know i probably don't have much to worry about, things will likely work themselves out, but i can just tell that at least the first 2 weeks or so back will be a real struggle for everybody. hopefully i at least get hours that overlap with everybody else so i can meet all the new hires.",2
"what s one of the most powerful lines from a song you ve heard?. for me, i ll have to say it took the death of hope to let you go by slipknot. a line from their most well known song, snuff i say this because i have been looking into stoicism the last year and it always made my nose crinkle up in stubbornness when i heard the quotes cease all hope and you will cease to fear but upon listening to this song more deeply and being more open to stoicism i see now that it s not hope in of itself that is bad or should be given up but perhaps the sort of hope we attach to a desired outcome, fear of the future, a person, or anything outside of ourselves that is more harmful. hence it took him killing hope for this person and this relationship in order to let that person go and for them to finally feel free. sounds kind of brutal or perhaps a bit cliche but absolutely powerful the more i think about it and ruminate on it. how about you? : have a good day stranger",2
public libraries. why are public library buildings always the nicest building in a town? every time i pass a library it s like the town put millions of dollars into it. is it just because books hold a lot of value? i wanna know your thoughts on this lol,2
"is it me?. or is there something going on that feels somewhat surreal. i have been feeling a shift not only in my life but in general. the days seem to feel more dream like as if it s not me living it. trust me, i have nothing going on other than work, go home and repeat. i m single as a pringle working on bettering myself and pretty much living the moment. is this what it feels like living in the present. should i be worried?",2
"giving my friend's son a place to sleep, proud of my little good deed. my friend's husband passed away in 2 12, she passed away last month. i've known her son since he was a baby, i actually was only 15 when he was born and his mom had him at 2 , and i have very cute memories from those days: for some reason i was his ''favourite adult''. like, he wanted to involve me in any kind of activity. for example.. his parents were going on a vacation or going out on a saturday night? he would ask ''is she coming with us?'', his mom then would tell me ''my son really always asks about you, i'm a little jealous'' lol of course this stopped at some point, he stopped doing that when he was about 11 12, i reckon he was old enough at that point, but still.. he was always quite happy to see me whenever his mom was hanging out with me. he's 19, not really independent yet, he doesn't even have a car, or a job, and he wants to go to university and become a teacher. i have a large two storey house, and even though i have a boyfriend i still live alone at the moment. when i offered to help, he said ''i knew i could always count on you'', it was a very cute thing to hear and it made me a little proud. i almost feel like i'm his aunt.",2
"i get more joy from making others happy then making myself happy, ama.. by that i mean that if i got a video game i wanted or a nice hoodie, i d be happy, right? well i do get happy but my brain is always like ehhh do you deserve that? . when i make others happy my brain is always like heeey you aren t a waste of space, here s some dopamine or something like that. basically: me lt; don t care others lt; want to be happy that s also the main reason i want to be in the entertainment business, streaming, comedy, acting, etc",2
"why is the tron franchise so under appreciated underrated?. in my own opinion, it defiently is up there with one of the most underrated franchises of all time. a movie like that made back in 2 1 , it feels like a movie that was just recently released. fair enough the cgi for clu could ve been better but other than that, i genuienly think it s such an iconic franchise and has an amazing cartoon show to follow up on it. the whole cast was amazing and daft punk soundtrack was literally the cherry on top. my question to ask is in your opinion, what was wrong with the tron franchise? looking forward to your comments ",2
"which singer has a voice you adore?. for me, it s nat king cole and joss stone. nat s voice is so silky smooth. iirc his pronunciation in spanish was awful but his voice was so exquisite that native speakers overlooked that. joss stone s voice is sensual and pure musicality.",2
"where are you from and how are you feeling?. just a mental check in : i'm from the us personally i'm at a 4 1 . mathematically bad but okay in my charts. i was actually doing better but i saw a post where someone was celebrating a milestone that they had wanted to achieve for so long and...i don't know. i'm happy for them but it made me look back at myself and i ended up hurting my own feelings lol. anyways enough about me, how are you? what's on your mind?",2
"looking for some positive thoughts. been battling tinnitus for 2 months now. has anyone had their tinnitus clear up after treating the underlying issue? looking for some success stories.. i ve been to r tinnitus already. i ve been t various ents and they believe it s a result of an ear sinus infection, eustachian tube dysfunction caused by allergies. i have days where it s very faint static, or gone. other days it s there and annoying. only in one ear. i m currently on more antibiotics and nasal sprays, mucinex, claritin and have an allergy test scheduled. it s so hard to remain optimistic because this has ruined my life. can t eat much because it triggers it. can t go out for a few drinks because it triggers it. can t go anywhere too loud because it triggers it. i have trouble working because stress triggers it. my entire life has come to a complete halt the past two months and i m terrified this is going to be permanent. i haven t found many success stories because i feel most people who browse tinnitus areas are those that are still impacted by it. success stories have probably moved on. anyone have theirs go away and get back to their normal life? would love to hear from ya ",2
"my brother is 13, going on 14 and i still hug him and kiss his head, i ve done so since he was a baby. i m 19, is it strange?. i guess it became a habit and i felt like i needed to protect him since being young. i m not sure where that comes from maybe the fact that he has asthma and i worry about it, and the fact that he almost got taken once in the store by a woman. i ve stopped hugging him as much now because he s getting older and i don t want to be seen as strange for it. view poll https: www.reddit.com poll wqr2fy ",2
"does anyone else just stare at the moon, planets or stars and just think about it all. like the size, or the distance. it's all amazing.. whenever i see the moon i just have to look at it, just thinking about how it's a huge ball floating far away and how it orbits us, or the stars which are so far away we will never go there. or the planets which just look awesome.",2
"after 14 years, i finally graduated.. basically the title. i made a lot of bad decisions while i was younger, never really quit college but constantly failed classes, changed majors, changed colleges, etc. well, today i finally got the news that my general studies exam here in my country you gotta take a final test thats about basically all you saw in the courses was satisfactory enough for me to graduate. was so scared i was gonna fail that i didnt start any tramits regarding graduation but i will do so now. im a bith ashamed of taking this long so i really wont ""spread the news"" among friends nor family other than my parents, of course, they have always been supportive but i did want to share it with someone so here i am. im finally done with school at 32 years old. edit: i truly appreciate all of your words. im sorry i couldnt reply to everyone thats been supportive here.",2

"do you guys have any slow friends?. slow as in they just pick up things very slowly. whether it be learning a new task at work or getting into a video game, they would always be the slowest to get up to speed or adapt to changing variables. is it frustrating? how do you deal with it? i have a friend who is like this and i don t want to be mean so i kind of let him do his own thing and help him out if he asks for it, but other than that i just quietly observe.",2
"what is your ptsd song songs? it's impossible for me to be the only one having a list.. i think we all have the songs that we now listen back to and it gives us the chills as it once helped us through the tough times. the song doesn't have to be relatable to the situation....just on your playlist during the time. for me some songs are happy and jolly but are tied to some messed up situation. lol my list: i am coming home by dirty money, both of us by paradise fears, count on me by bruno mars, master of puppets by metallica. psychosocial by slipknot and a few more that i can't remember.",2

"is it wrong to try and talk to somebody about their feelings and personal life if you are doing it simply for your fulfillment?. basically i moved across country but when i went back home for a week earlier this summer i ended up hooking up with a a close friend of mine who told me she had feelings for me it was kind of random . i eventually told her i couldn t keep talking to her as if we were together because i started seeing another girl that i really had feelings for at the time, and am in love with now, and honestly i asked my friend out years ago and she rejected me but now i really am not interested in having a relationship with her outside of friends with benefits because i am not attracted to her in that way. anyways occasionally she will text me or call me because she is upset and wants someone to talk to but i usually don t engage because i honestly don t really care anymore. i live 3 miles away and hadn t seen her for 1.5 years before this summer, so it s hard for me to really talk to her about such things. anyways i was upset about something that happened with the girl ive been dating now and felt very lonely and depressed about a lot of things because i really don t have any close friends outside of her where i live. i ended up texting my friend from back home to see how she s doing because i know she s not in the greatest place right now but as i m talking to her i m starting to feel like a piece of shit because i don t care so much and am using it in a way to just talk to someone to cure my own loneliness",2
"i love piano playing, and i want to get better. i m so passionate about piano playing. i have a small keyboard but due to school and other things in life, im not able to play often enough to get better. currently i can play it at a beginner level but i really want to play more efficiently. i want to eventually learn how to play the angel beat s opening on piano, because that op is my favorite ever and it would sound so beautiful on the keys. they offer piano classes at my school but i can t take any yet because of some required courses i have to get through and pass t t don t know what this post is. guess i just wanted to stress my grievances with the piano. i just need a method i can practice every day so i can get good anyways i really want to hear if anyone wants to learn how to play an instrument but can t, for some reason.",2

"is it weird to cuddle my toddler son while he sleeps?. he's about to be 3 later in august and i like to cuddle him. the mother and i aren't together so we switch off each week, maybe 2 or 3 weeks. i'm 26 and am currently living with family at the moment as is his mother, who's around mostly women girls and a baby cousin. when he's here i love to cuddle him alot. he's maturing more and more each time i see him and i know he won't be into cuddles for much much longer. he likes to cuddle when we watch tv; he'll lay sit next to me into my arm alot. i often hold him while he goes down for his nap and he falls asleep pretty fast; of course i'll put him down after and go do my thing, sometimes he puts himself to sleep for the nap. same with bed time however i tend to kinda chill with him, hold him, let him lay on me sometimes, run my hands through his hair, rub his back, give him kisses and tell him i love him, i'm proud of him, he's great, etc. sometimes we'll play with my phones flashlight with finger shadows or watch a show. sometimes read some. he usually goes off onto the other side of the bed when he's tired about to really fall asleep so i'll tuck him in with one of his stuffed animals lined up and give him a kiss and let him put himself to sleep. i respect his space and his wants. but sometimes during the night i'll come hold him in my arms and give him some forehead kisses and rub his back a little, just watch him dream or talk in his sleep he's too cute for a minute awhile and put him back down on his pillows. i dont know, some people could find it weird that a 26 year old father is doing that especially when they're just sleeping but i don't look at it like that, i just love him, want to enjoy the time when i can with him nothing is promised and no telling when he'll not want to , he's cute and i like to show him affection and give him good vibes and energy while he sleeps; maybe he'll feel them and give him good dreams too. i'm just wondering what you guys think? should i just lay off and save it for the day time with him or should i keep doing so as long as he's comfortable with it? i know parenting differs person to person, family from family, but i just figured i'd get other people's opinions and experiences with this because if i could be stunting his maturing or independence or something that's the last thing i want to do. thanks in advance i appreciate it, i'll try to respond back to everyone when i'm able to. hope everyone is having a great day night and the best safe vibes and wishes",2
"occasionally i will actually read every name in movie end credits and mentally say good job personname so they feel acknowledged for their role.. i know they will never know that they were acknowledged by a stranger, but it makes me happy feeling like assistant makeup artist 7 got some credit. those people should be acknowledged for their hard work and contribution toward the film too. i know not everyone has the same perspective toward their career, but thinking about how someone excitedly called their mom to say how excited they were to get that little role in the credits makes my heart feel warm and fuzzy, and the concept of their joy brings me joy too.",2

"help me practice haiku describe the problems in your life and i'll try to write a haiku that's probably bad . i've been wanting to write haiku to summarise and process things i feel. the way i see it is, that there is something i feel, and there is a puzzle in the form of a haiku . the goal is to write a haiku that summarises either the thing i'm thinking of, or how it makes me feel. somehow summarising my more complex, scattered thoughts i'm maybe unwilling to think of, unable to process, or just straight up suppress, and writing them down in the form of a haiku, focusing heavily on how it feels, seems to give me joy i'll delete this if it turns out to be too difficult or shitty lol. so, hit me with problems in your life how it feels. anything really. even if it's good stuff edit: someone wrote this on a comment: i'm a pampered boy about to get the shit slapped outta me by reality face reality my response: an easy life anguish awaits, i grow colder a storm's brewing",2

"what are your favorite ways to use eat oranges?. oranges are one of my favorite fruits, the bright flavors and the juiciness, they're just so refreshing. i'm perfectly fine with eating them as they are, but why stop there, i thought? what are your favorite things to do with them? would consider a fruit salad, but citrus fruits seem odd to put in one, they're probably like the only fruits aside from coconut, tomato, avocado, other citrus that i wouldn't actually put in a fruit salad. one of my favorite ways to eat them has to be a topping to chocolate orange overnight oats, the bright flavors of the orange and deep richness of the cocoa is divine. so, how do you like your oranges?",2
"community question 2: what was your favorite moment in math class?. math is, surprisingly, my favorite class, not only because i am the best in my class, but also because i have fun doing it. i know a lot of people hate it, but what was your favorite memory of math class? personally, it was when we would play this math game that my math teacher call ""jeopardy""' even though it was not even like the real game, but it some of my favorite moments.",2
wisdom tooth isn't that wise. the long and short of it is this. i had all my teeth pulled some years ago except for one wisdom tooth. it hasn't been a problem except the last few months. so last week i had it taken out. this is one of the most painful things i have and continue to endure. i also developed a dry socket. i can't eat even the most mundane things like yogurt without it hurting even more than it already does. put this in context i had 3 hip surgeries and 2 back surgeries and those were cake walks compared to this. i can handle a lot of pain but this is unreal. when they had pulled all my teeth in one sitting it was this bad. i already went back in so they could put a dressing in the dry socket which did help for a few hours.,2

"what's a embarrassing childhood memory you might have repressed until something reminded you of it. hey friends i'm sure we all have some weird childhood trauma that under any other circumstance probably wouldn't be that bad but at the time you didn't have the greatest grasp on what is actually terrible and it scarred you for life, so basically in good faith i will tell you a story of i'm pretty sure a 5 year old me, a child size sailor suit, a cut out of a yellow submarine, a few other kids, some older men, and my own father. the year was probably 1998, possibly 1999, i was a small stupid child of 5 or 6 and and my dad was a fairly recent ex sailor who left the navy shortly after i was born. there was a reunion he and his old sailor buddies were throwing and they wanted a performance from their kids and i don't know who suggested we sing the beatles song the yellow submarine but i mean it probably fits. this is all basically set dressing as i don't exactly remember most of this event but it did actually happen there's a vhs tape somewhere and i shudder to think of what would happen if it was found. the only thing i remember is me and like 3 or 4 other kids dressed in child size sailor uniforms holding a big cut out of a yellow submarine singing the song relatively terribly while a room full of older men laughed at us sang louder then us as well... now everything i hear the song this is what plays in my head, thanks dad.",2
"stressed out if my mind. just need to talk about things and breathe.. about a month ago, i moved halfway across the country to seattle. i can't quite explain why, but i've always wanted to be up here in this area. there's a lot of places i've really enjoyed seeing and there's so much i want to do there are some problems, however. first of all, i'm 'homeless'. i got a job lined up before i moved. they were so eager to have a new employee qualified and eager to work in the northeast that they offered to pay for an extended stay and cover some of my travel costs to start work a month earlier. fantastic i jumped on the idea, already with a few places in mind to move into, and took the opportunity to relax and take some extra time to find a good place to live. things were going great unfortunately, as i started the last week of my stay, everything up here runs a credit check before renting and mine came back with over 2 owed to collections that i was totally unaware of. part of it i totally forgot, part i thought had already been taken care of, but more than half was from an apartment three years ago that has given me more grief than anything. with that on my credit, my applications have all been denied. a week later, all of my debts are paid. unfortunately, the company will not pay for my housing any longer. i travel a lot and have the opportunity to stay at hotels with the company most nights , but it's impossible for them to justify it every night. i got a great deal on a few hotel rooms on the weekends, but i don't have any permanent home. my car registration is due next month, but without an address, i can't register it. i i broke my phone and can't get it replaced until friday. i felt like i was so careful and had everything in order. i had 6 before i moved, but it's quickly running low, especially if you consider rent and the deposit i need for a place. i'm struggling, though i do have enough to get back to my parents if i absolutely can't make it. i've found a few people looking for roommates soon , but not now . i'm just tired. i just want a 'home'. i just need a break.",2

"what would you think about a party that's sole purpose is to abide by their word and be honest?. i think at heart, all political parties aim to do what is good for everybody in their own way, but it completely detracts from the main purpose, they actually have to do it. so let's take a step back and say a party introduced themselves, their policies were democratic, they aimed to do well for everybody, but they didn't quantify their use through the metrics, of import export numbers, jobs, inventories, etc. they quantified themselves simply by asking gt;did we do what we said we'd do? there's no left, or right, or progressive, or conservative, because at some point they all suffer from the same problem, they become corrupt. hypothetically, with a party who's sole purpose is to not become corrupt, they could offer some stability and actually work with their constituents to do the best for everybody. do you think you would vote for them? a party who is simply their, for you to trust and be honest?",2

"do you typically engage with reddit followers?. i'm kinda curious. i assume that most the people who follow me just do so because i post food they like or something. so like, they follow me but usually say nothing. which is all good, i don't really mind having followers and if i post stuff someone likes, that's cool. usually i don't go through their profiles or anything since i try to avoid ""snooping"" whenever possible on people who'd probably rather remain unnoticed. so rather than ask them personally, i'm making this post. do you often message people once they follow you, or when you follow someone, how do you feel getting messaged by them? other thoughts you want to share? reddit is unique, and i love it for that. it is a little confusing as well though, because social interactions don't follow suit here like they do on instagram for example. you might have numerous interactions with people, but never actually speak. like many people on this sub, i recognize ""oh you're that person who likes x "" but our interactions are only on the posts and comments, not personal",2

"is it really that bad to distrust people. let me start off by saying i've gone through some pretty bad situations. i realize they have shaped the way i view people, i know this. i tend to have a more, what most would consider, pessimistic outlook towards others, and what i just consider a realistic outlook. i in general believe people can be good, and often choose to do good, but deep down, not so deep down i hold the belief they won't do good. i get this probably drives people batty. so i often keep those thoughts to myself, and only share it with 2 people, and only when asked about certain situations. what i don't understand is, why someone would get angry when that opinion is voiced. if you know i hold a more pessimistic view point based on the things that have happened to me as a person, and don't want to hear it, why ask? is it really that bad to have a pessimistic view of others in the sense of an, ""i'll believe it when i see it"" attitude? why is this outlook on life so looked down upon? especially by people who know most people who hold those views have been hurt often and have trust issues? i guess it's just mind boggling to me why this would be an issue. are pessimistic people really that bad? i'm not talking rude and hurtful pessimists, but more in line of realistic pessimists.",2

i just thought of a random misunderstanding i briefly had when i was 7.. i remember hearing as a kid that toy story took five years to make. for some reason i misheard it as 5 years. i had this image of a man with a beard and a robe in ancient mesopotamia declaring a new thing called a movie would be created and it would be about toys secretly being alive. i then pictured generations of people slowly working on it throughout the years. i also pictured kings in the middle ages and people later on in the 17 s being sad they wouldn t live to see toy story even though it was mostly complete. i pictured the camera being invented in the 2 th century and the inventor being excited that thousands of years of work could finally be filmed as the ancient people predicted. i felt so fortunate to be alive at a time in 1995 when such a grand project could be completed but also sad that i wouldn t live to see toy story 2 in another 5 years.,2

"watching movies from 6 's 9 's feels strange. our fathers and grandfathers' generation smoked indoors. no one frowned upon them. it was every day normal thing. my dad smoked indoors too until law forbade it they just smoked in everywhere freely. it looks so bizarre. also life was...more loose. education wasn't that much tight. people just graduated high school and got a job. or they didn't have much knowledge about general things compared to current generations. mz's must be the most knowledgeable ones in history thx to internet and life was much more slow. more relaxed. when i was child people used to open their front doors during summers to let the fresh air in. now we can't do it, you know, robbers and thieves and all kinds of dangers. another thing is that people in old movies were more rude. in other words, much more straightforward. i don't know, it was like that in real life too when i was child. good or bad, those times feel like a century ago, not decades ago. and inflation. get shocked every time i hear the actors talking about price of stuffs. lol.....",2
"can the summer just end so we can enter autumn and winter please. okay so i need to rant about this because i'm so done with summer and i want to know if anyone else feels the same way. i'm done with the warm weather and the long days and just feeling hot and sweaty all the damn time. i'm starting to realize that spring and mostly summer are my least favorite seasons and that i'm feeling the worst during those seasons. warm weather makes me cranky and not feeling good. i sleep the worst during those seasons, especially in summer. i'm just craving for autumn and winter. i'm craving the cold and the rainy days. that i can wear sweaters again and buckle up in coats and scarfs. that when i go outside i can actually breathe in fresh air and not get a headache instantly because it's so warm. i'm craving the coziness of these months, watching cozy films and decorating the environment i live in with cozy colors, especially during december because of christmas. i'm just so done with summer that i'm starting to hate it and i miss autumn and winter so much, can time please go faster so summer is over.",2

"rick amp; morty ""not for everyone"". to be fair, you have to have a very high iq to understand rick and morty. the humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer s head. there s also rick s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature, for instance. the fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they re not just funny they say something deep about life.",2
"calorie deficit going well. about 3 weeks ago i started a calorie deficit in a attempt to lose weight at a higher level then before. i ve been working out for a few months now but while i did see muscles on my arms and legs massively improve i saw no improvement on my weight. so i decided i need to actually get serious and start a calorie deficit if i really wanna lose weight. i ve lost around 8 pounds in the past 3 weeks, which to some may not some like a lot but in my other attempts of losing weight the most i lost was like 1 pounds over a few months since my eating habits were still terrible. the calorie deficit is in a weird way helping me get on track, in the past 3 weeks i solved all the issues i ve been having months. i transferred colleges, i m practically hired at home depot just waiting for them to finish my background check , i made appointments to finally get my id and driving permit, i ve been learning to cook, been cleaning more, been outside my room more, and becoming more confident. i ve stopped drinking sodas, started a slight schedule, stopped eating a lot of snacks, i ve started eating three meals a day instead of 2, and is oddly teaching me discipline. it has shown me just how unhealthy my eating habits were. i hope to cut down to around 158 lbs because my favorite kickboxer is around that weight and is slightly shorter than me.",2

"you ever get so obsessed with something that you want to surround yourself with reading about it even when you're not playing it, but so little content pertaining to is exists online so you're just stuck with endless thoughts and nowhere to put them?. it's a frustrating experience. some more mainstream things i often fixate on are donkey kong, pikmin, and tf2 all of these things have hundreds of thousands of fanart, discussion, quality videos, rom hacks or mods, merchandise, podcasts, and most importantly large communities of people equally as obsessed as me who want to discuss these things and are open to hearing my thoughts on them. what i'm really into right now is this vr game called gorilla tag. to keep a long story short, it's basically a vr game where you play tag as a gorilla, except the only way to move is by hitting your hands onto the walls floor to propel yourself. it's one of the greatest games ever made imo and i think in the future it'll be recognized as an important turning point in the history of vr gaming and maybe even gaming as a whole. it does have over 4 million downloads and upwards of 6 , people playing daily, but here's the catch in my 13 hours of playing this game, i think i've come across exactly 5 people who are over the age of 18. as a result, in game conversations are entirely with children, the youtube side of things is 99 mediocre boring youtube non content ""me playing with fans "" or ""gorilla tag but if i fart the video ends "" , the reddit side of things is all but dead and what little content is posted is typically repetitive and obviously posted by children, the discord is so populated that chat scrolls by rapidly and trying to have an actual conversation is pointless and these kids don't want to have the types of conversations i want to have. worst of all it seems like no adults out there have even heard of it. i've brought it up to a lot of people, and before i can even begin talking about it i have to explain the game, the premise, why it's fun, etc. and i don't wanna just go on and on for hours so after the long intro i typically pick up on them not wanting to hear about it any more. so my hyperactive brain just buzzes about these things and wishes i could get these thoughts out. it sucks do you have anything like that in your life? what is it? tell me a little bit about it, i'd love to hear ",2

"you guys did me a huge solid by talking me out of isolating myself. i'm so happy and relieved. thanks. i'm grateful.. a while ago, i think a few days ago i made this post: https: www.reddit.com r casualconversation comments wlxmfn im thinking about locking myself in my room for it was brought on by an already persistent solitary isolation that evolved into maybe some sort of psychosis that increasingly made me paranoid and detached from the outside. idk why i thought it'd be better if i isolated myself more. thankfully in my moments having seen this as a casual subreddit i casually explained my idea in case i wasn't applying proper judgement. thank god cause the post probably hit a nerve in a lot of people that caringly advised me to not go for it at all as it might be detrimental to me physically and mentally with maybe long term effects. i got scared cause i was already isolating myself a lot. so the next day, i went outside and bicycled. i did the same next day too only this time i reached out to some friends and played and basketball in the evening the next day i reached out to the same friend from above and went with him to a sports club and met a lot of new faces and ran a fucking lot and today i went to bicycle again and chased the evening setting sun. i'm aware i can fall back into the tendencies of wanting to isolate myself but i'll be so much more cautious. i'm so scared thinking what was i thinking? i could have really fucked my brain health and set myself back so much and turn out miserable even at the end of the year. it's so scary. thank you for the word of guidances i feel so much more better in just a few of sunshine and outside than i had in months.",2

"what do you think you d truly wish for if you found a genie in a bottle?. let s go with aladdin rules of no multiplying wishes, no resurrection, and no falling in love. i feel like the only really important rule is the first but we ll keep it classic. also feel free to skip or skim over my ramblings below and just give your answers, as i definitely got pretty carried away. i know this has been asked so many times before, but i always find it fun to read through people s thoughts and wishes, and to ponder mine. personally, even though i think about it way too often, i just really don t know. my first thoughts are always to maximize my wishes in some way, so sometimes i think my first wish would be to be all knowing, that way i could be better informed for my next two wishes. but like i feel like that d break my brain. i already suffer from having too zoomed out a world view, where it feels like most everyday things are just meaningless since our existence is hardly a speck in terms of time and space. i would love the ability to control the weather, because i love things like rain and storms and wind and fun cloud formations. but im 1 positive i would accidentally fuck everything up and cause untold devastation because i was feeling particularly moody and wanted to experience a hurricane. it also feels to me that no matter how positive i could try to make my wishes, there would somehow be a lot of negative consequences. and so many technicalities. i d love to wish for world peace for instance, but what all does that entail? is it just no violence, or no disagreement? because we kinda need disagreement for progression. and as much of a peace loving person as i am, i still recognize that there have been times where violence may have been called for, or something that some view as violent others view as part of life, like hunting for instance, which humans have been doing for many tens of thousands of years. even something as specific as no violence between humans could have consequences that we ve never considered, because we ve never not had interpersonal violence. and then there are answers that don t break the wishing rules but could break the rules of physics and the universe. like the ability to form and control atoms or control time or something. would be fun to play around with, but that s an insane amount of power that again, could have powerful consequences. ugh, i m too indecisive and scared of monkey paws what do you all think?",2

"the time i was accidentally a creep. this was many years ago, i think i was like 19 or something like that. some context to start. i used to live in a very small apartment complex next to a very expensive gated house community. this community had the fame of being a place where criminals would live since it s been historically quite expensive, and so most people tried to not get involved as to not get into trouble. one day i noticed one of the houses had a chained colombian red howler monkey on their rooftop. these monkeys are wild animals and it is illegal to keep them as pets. i wanted to report this to the environmental police, but i wanted to do it anonymously because, as i mentioned, that community was rumored to be inhabited by criminals, and if they were willing to keep a wild animal as a pet despite it being illegal, i did not want to risk it and let it be known it was me who reported it. i needed the address, which was easy to get, and i needed the house number, which wasn t as easy because i couldn t see it by myself there were shrubs and vegetation covering the fence that divided our complex from their community , and i was scared to ask the guard at the guard. one evening i saw a couple of kids playing next to the fence, so i got an idea. we have a dachshund dog that my sister and i would take out on walks around a complex, and there was a small hole in the fence next to where the kids where playing, so i told the kids that my dog escaped through that dog and asked them if they d seen a little black long dog. when they said no, i told them that i saw him running towards that house with the monkey, and then asked if they d be so kind to tell me the number of the house; they did, and so i was able to report it and no more than a week later the monkey was gone. it was later on that i realized how creepy i had been with the kids. they were like 7 or 8, playing by themselves, when this 19 year old girl beckons them through the shrub to ask them about her lost dog. at least my intentions were good and the monkey was saved lol.",2

"i wish me and my dad got along more. my dad, has seen all the ups and downs of life since his childhood. as far as i have heard, it's not been easy, but rather filled with struggles and pain. which sometimes makes me wonder, is that the reason why he is what he is today ? my dad is the complete opposite of me, not so open minded, gets angry on every little thing, leads a routine and monotous life, doesn't get enough sleep, is always lecturing me about something or the other, etc etc. my relationship with him hasn't exactly been so wholesome and good, even since childhood. i am much closer to my mom, my dad ? not so much. i feel like our relationship keeps getting worse and worse every now and then. even since childhood, he's never understood me or my problems properly, and i don't blame him to be honest. he has tried his best, but he never got me. i hate saying this but i have always seen him as a villain. always angry, always so strict for no reason, always a bit sexist in his views, blah blah blah. and, yet again, i have no rights to deem his a villain completely because he has fulfilled every wish of mine till now. every single thing i asked for or didn't ask for has been bought for me. everything from expensive clothes, shower watches, books and more. i feel that personally, i am much more priveleged compared to the kids i have seen so far in my life. yet there exists an awkwardness between us, more from side than him. i can tell my mom my deepest secrets and so on, yet i really hesitate with talking to my dad even for the smallest things. it sucks. i don't why, but hugging my father feels like the hardest thing to do in the universe. i can accomplish the most impossible tasks, but hugging my father is really really hard. i also the hate fact that every single object i own till today has come from my father's money. i want to be financially independent soon. anyways, sorry if the wall of text seems incongruent and random, i don't really know how to express my self like some of yall do so professionaly here xd",2

"i think i just figured out my purpose in life.. i 2 m was having a conversation with a family friend 55f whom i occasionally hang out with and talk to. i've been working at my old childhood elementary school for the last 2 years, basically since graduating high school, and now i'm moving up into a higher paying job at a different school. i work with all ages, but the kids i've always liked to work with the most are the younger ones in preschool, kindergarten, or first grade. their innocence and general sweetness cuteness genuinely feels therapeutic to be around. i would always try to make time to go play with the little ones during recess or lunch, and they loved it. one game they loved for a long time was being cops holding me captive in pretend jail, for a sentence of ""forever"" or 1 years. she already knew all of that, but i also opened up about my family's past history of trauma: dad started dating mom fresh outta jail in 1998, and was on drugs when i was a newborn infant, my older brother 31 went down a path from age 1 or so of being easily angered and aggressive, and eventually getting into drugs as an adult, my big sister then 19, now 33 died when i was 5, parents marriage started deteriorating when i was 6, my dad got back into ice when i was 9, lots of fights and screaming and stuff being thrown, and then my parents divorced and it took my dad 9 years 2 12 to 2 21 to come back to our hometown after he moved away to get clean because my mom said she wouldn't let him see me anymore if he didn't . it wasn't so much being afraid or being in physical danger that got to me, as it was just being around constant shouting, anger, conflict, and negative energy. and the kicker thing is: the kids i work with that i tend to have the strongest bonds with and spend the most time with and get the most hugs from? i would come to learn overtime that those are the ones that are currently growing up in families with constant anger and shouting and negative energy, just like mine. i can name at least 3 or 4 right off the top of my head, and this school has 85 kids its one of 4 elementary schools in a town of 7,5 . basically, the conclusion she came to is that the reason why i love playing and helping out with little kids as much as i do is because i don't want any of them to grow up with the kinda angry toxic stuff i saw with my family as a little kid, seeing them smiling, laughing, and knowing that i make them happy and have a positive effect on their lives gives me a sense of self worth, and being around their innocence and kindness gives me a safe haven to be free from the negativity of the world. and hearing that honestly just made me tear up. i feel like i just unlocked my entire purpose in life. she also said that she thinks the asperger's diagnosis i was given as a 3yo to explain why i was always screaming and crying as a baby, always seemed sensitive to everything and scared of everything, and hardly talked to people as a toddler, probably wasn't autism at all . she thinks i probably have anxiety or a nervous tick that was embedded into me as a baby hearing my parents fighting and yelling all the time, and that i articulate and function way too well to have autism.",2
"i did my first meal prep . a couple months ago, i bought a set of pyrex containers with snapware lids to do meal prep. however, my dishwasher was broken, so i never wanted to cook. it's fixed now, and i finally made my first meal prep i made balsamic vinegar roasted veggies for breakfast i don't like don't like cooking most breakfast foods , and i made salad kits to take to work. i usually don't eat breakfast because i hate cooking in the morning, unless i'm just warming up leftovers. i usually eat the free garbage food i get at work, but i know i'll feel better if i'm eating real food. also i slept really late today and felt like i wasted half of my day off, so i feel super extra accomplished to have done this.",2

"finally took control of my social media feeds, it feels incredible. quick back story: around 2 2 i got on social media instagram, twitter, reddit, the likes and followed friends. they'd be posting things i wasn't invited to, flexing on me, putting me down, and other sorts of problems. i was unhappy and felt down all the time hearing about how much so and so hates my music taste, this friend went to this place without me, someone asking for money for new shoes or some dumb thing like that. i don't know when it happened, but i decided enough was enough, and stopped caring, then unfollowed people who's posts i had despised viewing. lots of friends of friends, family friends, the usual suspects on instagram. my feed is now what i want to see and not what instagram wants me to see. i also went through and unfollowed anyone i didn't really know or talk to on twitter, and straight up deactivated my facebook account entirely. reddit's a nicer park since you choose what communities you're in unlike facebook and instagram. i left some of my good friends and bros on my following, as well as family since they post reasonably without totally snapping pics of their whole life. so now i leave you off with a question: how do you cope with fomo started by social media, flexers trying to make you feel down, and people with unreasonable standards for you? do any of you have tips to try and control what you intake everyday? feel free to share your thoughts on my method, as well as any steps you've taken, and i hope that my post might have inspired you to take control of your life.",2
"anyone else develop a special interest s because of a friend?. i've been applying for vet school, so lately i've been doing a lot of thinking about my life and what led me to where i am. i can't write about this particular experience in my application because they discourage talking about childhood, pre high school stuff. even if i could, i also don't think it would be the most relevant story to tell in my application. so i thought i would share here: i had a friend from 4th 6th grade who was super passionate about gray wolves and her enthusiasm about it was freaking infectious. she even convinced me to try and send an email to the president at the time about gray wolf conservation, which i was literally about to do until my parents convinced me otherwise. i carry that passion with me still today and a lot of the things i love like camping and the outdoors hunger games was so big at the time, we tried to do a full reenactment of the games in the woods came from spending that time with her and the rest of that friend group. we're still friends to this day, i moved to a different school after 6th grade but we reconnected at the end of college. it was like no time had passed, which is pretty crazy because that rarely happens in all the friendships i have had. we're on very drastically different career paths at the moment and she's going to school in a different country, so i feel a bit sad that it'll probably never be the same as it was but happy that it happened. i really hope she knows what a positive impact she had on my life and how grateful i am to have her friendship. sometimes i wonder if she felt the same way, did i impact her life the same way that she did? maybe sometime i'll ask her, hopefully i'll see her again in the near future ",2

"my experiences with adults growing up made me realize how important it is to ponder time, it s value, and what kind of attitude i d like to go about life. i recognized very early on that i could ve been born anything or anyone. that no matter what form i could ve taken on this earth, i will experience pain. being able to walk, see, and perceive was amazing to me. to be the eyes and the ears for trees, both a giver and receiver of the oxygen i breathe. i realized it is a privilege i get to experience earth in this form. as early as 1st grade, after learning of the stunning probability that went into me meeting this world, i can remember feeling gratitude for everything that came before me that made it possible for me to even be here. so many adults fear death and inflict unnecessary pain on to others not necessarily for the pain they inflict to cope with their own pain, but for the time they ve wasted of others that neither parties will ever get back. sometimes the things they do to cope with death and fear often inspire more fear and so the circle continues. nobody wants to leave this place but finding a way to be okay with it through gratitude for all the hard work and all the time the universe, nature, and people gave of themselves just for me to walk makes me so happy, even if i could only exist for a day. and to realize in 1st grade that i get to wake up and explore the very soil that birthed me for far more than just a few days? such a basic fact left me in awe of my sheer luck. this perspective helps me navigate extremely rough circumstances. it affords me so much more room to understand my surroundings be able to give a healthy dose of benefit of the doubt to others. i get so much more out of my life no matter how much pain is inflicted on me or witnessed because i get to live inside this brain that affords me so much. because of this perspective, my physical neurological pathways feel that people s actions and the pain they inflict physically and mentally do not belong to me, therefore they can t physically hurt me entirely. i wonder what i d do or how much more pain i d be in if i hadn t formed this ideology approach to life. therefore i cannot judge because i do not know what it s like inside another s head. does anyone here feel some adults make their fear of death their child s problem? to then inspire their children to fear death through showcasing unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking or abuse in order to find control? everyone loathes the idea of leaving but not everyone practices unhealthy coping mechanisms. does anyone here not fear death entirely and want to make space for their children to not fear it too? do you have any philosophies practices that help you not fear death? thank you for reading if you ve made it this far ",2

"if you don't define your life and or self worth by your career, hobbies, or relationships, what should you define yourself by, if anything?. i do a lot of introspection, and i often wonder how i should define my sense of self. some people define themselves with their career, a hobby, or their relationship ie. spouse and kids . but i've seen criticism for each of these things; namely, self help advice that ""you shouldn't define yourself by your career hobby relationship etc."" usually, this advice is in the context of supporting someone who is struggling with one of these things unsuccessful job hunting, not having an interesting hobby, recent break up, etc. . because honestly, if you ask me, i think most people in the world do define themselves with one or some of these things. so how would you define yourself, and why do you choose to define yourself in this way? personally, i've always somewhat defined myself by my hobbies. discovering and developing new skills hobbies take up a big part of my time. i just love learning new things plus i'm an only child, so i've had the lifelong habit of needing to entertain myself. i like that hobbies are things i can take initiative with, that i have reasonable independent control over; hobbies are very ""mine"" i don't need to depend on someone else to make them a success. i also like to define myself by how i impact the world around me. this can lead to some neuroses, admittedly, because i'm quite critical of myself. i often worry about whether i really am a positive force on other people, or whether other people like me, all that juvenile stuff. however, i also think defining yourself just means knowing yourself and accepting yourself as you are. this is something i still need a little more time to work on...",2

"how much of your childhood do you think on regularly, or remember?. i recently met a childhood friend for the first time in a long while. we got chatting at some length and reminisced about some events from our childhood, but he seemed to remember significantly more than i did. he seemed hurt that i didn't remember what were obviously very significant events for him. time we spent together building forts, movie nights, and hanging out by a river that was near our homes. and this just wasn't one or two things there seemed to be a shopping list length of things that i was supposed to remember but i just couldn't recall. i remember other things from my childhood but i really don't revisit old memories like that often, so every time it gets just a bit harder to recall and each time the memory is less certain. it's not like i'm that old either, i'm only 26 so i feel like i really shouldn't be losing memories like that already. how often do you reminisce about your childhood, and how much of it do you remember?",2

"i feel that most body positive influencers do more harm than help. we ve reached a point where an attractive woman with a stomach roll or two will position themselves as a body positivity martyr; where they will upload a photo without a filter still from a flattering angle ; where they will reveal themselves looking slightly bloated after dinner and get flooded with adulatory comments commending their bravery in many cases it s a form of virtue signalling, and i feel it only exacerbates the underlying issues, and causes beauty standards to feel even harsher than they are. consider: if a conventionally above average looking woman has built her entire online persona around flaunting her two rolls of fat and three cellulite dimples and consequently been praised to high heaven, how rotten must a conventionally unattractive woman who s considerably overweight feel? if the good looking woman has forged her image around having slightly asymmetrical breasts and small love handles then the unattractive woman showing any skin at all is automatically considered a sign of bravery, right? it s indirectly reaffirming what she already bloody sees every time she catches herself in a reflection: she s so very far from being conventionally physically desirable how is this helpful in any way? so then, how should somebody with a sincere body positive mindset help to redress the harsh societal beauty paradigm? they could start by dropping the body positive bullshit in their bio, by refraining from appending every post with a glib sentence about self love, by not pinching their belly rolls in every goddamn photo and hyper focusing on the fact that they aren t physically impeccable according to the beauty paradigm or drawing attention to the fact that they aren t using a filter, and instead just uploading photos which tacitly demonstrate this real confidence. in other words by being a normal person not a self appointed martyr. all moral grandstanding aside i m sure their heart is usually in the right place, however their head is not, and it s no wonder that more of my female friends suffer from eating disorders than ever before. feel free to disagree",2

"tiktok is bad, but it has so much potential.. i've recently decided to download tiktok for the first time. i was expecting cringy music videos or one of those stupid ''fun fact'' videos. instead what i got was some more chill content. like sculpturing, engineering and other informative videos. what i've come to realize is tiktok can be for everybody. and most of the people there go on the app to escape the real world. i've seen videos where people were talking about their mental problems or real life struggles. and the comments were always supportive. as humans, i guess we cant help ourselves but try to find a safe space where we can share our struggles and ideas. that is why i think tiktok can be a good platform and gets way more hate than it deserves. if you exclude all the cringy videos and the weird lip syncing, it is a nice platform where creators can create their own world and spread ideas just like any other social media platform. and the short mini videos concept and design are very clever and they work.",2

"i'm the most productive i've ever been since starting night shift. i actually cook now . most people claim night shift is terrible, people would even try to talk me out of switching over because they assumed i'd hate it. even in night shift facebook groups it seems nightshift is generally disliked and seen as only a plus because theres usually a pay differential. i know im obviously not, but it feels like i'm the only one who genuinely prefers it lol. day shift was brutal for me. i was constantly exhausted. i'd get up, go to work, and when i got home i didnt have the energy to do anything. i would be fighting to keep my eyes open all day, and by the time i got home it would be a losing battle. i lived off of lean cuisines, everyday i would zombie trudge to the microwave to heat up my daily meal. but at the same time, i would lay awake at night because my brain just wouldnt drift off to sleep. i needed heavy combination of sleeping pills just to get any form of sleep. i still take .5 mg of xanax to sleep because my tinnitus amp; brain just not shutting off keeps me up for hours if i dont, but it's much less heavy than what i used to take. i started working overnights in may and it has been life changing. i work 11 pm 7:3 am. this is usually my schedule now obviously it can vary but this is the basic outline : 8 am: arrive home. make my husband a breakfast or salad wrap he is a truck driver and works long days, he usually wakes up and goes directly to work so i make something he can quickly grab and eat . refill my bunny's supply of hay. 9 am: go to bed 11 am: husband leaves for work, since his alarm usually wakes me up too i get up to shower or whatever quick thing i have to do before going back to bed like if i'm making chicken and vegetables, i'll marinate the defrosted chicken and put it back in the fridge. if i need groceries, i'll send a curbside pickup order 3 or 4 pm: wake up. head to the grocery store to pick up the order. pass time by watching tv or playing video games. 6 pm: begin cooking dinner. other housework that has to be done like change bunny's litter box if it needs to be, take out trash, fold laundry i didnt get to. 7 or 8 pm depending on when i finish : pass more time 9 pm: start getting ready for work, make my sandwich even if i cook i bring a sandwich, my husband gets home atleast an hour after i leave and he has a big appetite since he doesn't have a chance to eat from being in a truck all day, if theres leftovers i bring them to work the next day , feed my bunnies their dinner salad. my biggest concern with the desire to start cooking was thinking of things to make everyday but i caught on quickly with coming up and keeping track of my ideas. i still deal with bad fatigue, honestly on my days off i usually sleep in until the time i usually cook dinner besides getting up to change out the laundry, days off are laundry day then go back for another nap around 4 am. but i'm actually able to do things now, unlike when i worked days and did nothing else but work and fight to stay awake.",2

"making strawberry popsicles brings so much joy to my day. there was a really good price on strawberries yesterday, and i bought three cartons just so we could use one to make strawberry popsicles with. my almost three year old and i cut them up this morning she has little plastic kid safe knives that she s actually getting pretty good with and blended them and i poured them into the popsicle molds and she stuck the sticks in. she gets so excited to do this and it s such a small thing that makes me feel like i m living in a perfect moment. there was a little left over that didn t fit in the molds, so i added a bit of water and gave her a small cup of strawberry juice and she was thrilled. i love the tiny things that make her so excited. i know she won t remember these days, but i will forever. being an adult is weird but can be wonderful.",2
"the word is so beautiful and full of love, and i am so happy to be alive.. i am just literally in love with life this year it literally started in april slash may, when i was stressed out to the max about the last months of school, packed to death with homework and study but gods know when i looked out of the window of the bus and saw the sunrise...everything looked so beautiful. everything and everyone and i felt happy to be there, sitting there, revising for the test of the day or reading a love novel with my friend to my side. like there is so much beauty and love in every day life. and we are all human and are so much like each other is painfully in a great way. do you ever stop and think about it? because i do it pretty like, love is all around us, and we don't even realize it. love is my mom who wakes in the middle of the night because she cant sleep and still comes to cheek on me in my room even if i am all grown up now, and she tucked me in if i kicked my blankets of while sleeping. or my dad who every time we go to the store still looks for my favorite ice cream even if we are pretty sure they don't sell it anymore. love is when my friends and i call each other even if we are all kilometers apart and stay on call for hours on hours laughing till our bellies hurt. or me and my classmate, i know she is a history nerd so every time i see something cool i send it to her and she sends me back things about knitting or the best love stories she could find knowing how much i love it and we can rant to each other about our fields of interest for a whole day if you let us. love is also making water and mint syrup for myself and watching a comedy when i am sad. there is so much kindness too, like when my cousins and i saw this woman shop for clothes alone and clearly having a bad time, looking all sad and insecure in the fitting room and we started hyping her up for half an hour, or when my buddy and i were freshmen, first year latin students and one of the older ones on the buss lead us in chanting the first declination because we kept messing up and he wanted us to revise well before our lesson. or the kind lady at the bookstores who always gives me the best records even when i don't ask for them. ok i am sorry for all the ramblings, but gods i needed to get this out of me, i mean, we give all those little act of kindness of love for granted and sometimes and is such a shame because if we do we lose the beauty of contemplating it even if only for a moment. we are all human at the end and at the core we are all loving and kind and beautiful even if we forget it ....so well hey, i am a random stranger on the internet who decided to try to remember you of that so, to keep the conversation going and follow the spirit of this sub, what are the small act of love and kindness you did or saw today? i would love to hear about those.",2
"i m absolutely baffled. i m an asian person chinese more specifically living in australia, racism isn t too bad here but it still happens quite often, most of the time it s just micro aggressions. i started working at a caf about 5 weeks ago and i ve never experienced any thing too uncomfortable from customers, normally they are pretty nice. but a couple days ago i was at work, my co worker made a coffee for a customer so i went to their table, the customers both around their 4 s 5 s. i walked over to their table and placed the man s coffee down and i hear his friend say something to me arigato gozai mashita i couldn t hear what he said because i wasn t really focused on him but i assumed it was directed at me sorry what did you say? and this guy looks at me directly in the eyes. oh well i said thank you in japanese, you re japanese right? i was absolutely flabbergasted, astonished even obviously i had to keep smiling and not cringe. i shook my head and told him no ah well are you chinese then i thought it would honestly be over and he d take his l and move on, yet again having to keep smiling despite me wanting to crumble up into a ball i shake my head up and down ahh xie xie i smiled at him and walked away. not the worst thing that could happen but it was still very uncomfortable, but whenever i would clear tables near him he d stare at me which rubbed me the wrong way. it shocked me why someone just out of the blue would ask someone s ethnicity, especially when someone s just trying to do their job. still very confused and i didn t think that would ever happen to me but here i am",2

"as a person of asian descent, i hold asians at a higher expectation due to my upbringing.. in asian culture, an offspring's behavior and conduct are often a reflection of their parents or guardians. it is shameful to be rude or cause unnecessary disruptions in public because it is considered disrespectful to one's parents. i believe the collectivist ideals and elements of east asian culture have been ingrained upon me at a very young age. another interesting cultural concept is called ""saving face."" this concept essentially boils down to keeping others from losing respect for oneself or to avoid embarrassment. this is why japanese people in modern times are known for their humility and respectful behaviors towards others. for me, whenever i see an asian who is rude and disrespectful, i immediately direct my judgement towards the parents. in my mind, it may be that this hypothetical person's parents did not raise them properly. this is a contrast to u.s. american culture, but as someone who was raised in an asian household, it was what i was taught. my parents would always point out a bad person on the news as asian if they were of asian descent. that was the first thing that they zero in on because the notion of asians behaving badly is not something that is normal to them. as such, i have begun to study american and asian culture. the dichotomy of asian and western culture presents an interesting train of thought.",2
"with as busy as life and the world is around us, it is important to set aside time in our schedules to relax and recharge.. as the titles says, between the world around us, work, and everything in between, there has become a very ""go go go"" attitude. as much as we have kur google calendar filled with meetings during the week, ur should equally have ""break time"" incorporated into that as well. it can be something small such as a set half hour every day. or it can be not a daily occurrence but a larger chunk of time that is just a longer period to really just ""recover"" of sorts. for me, i take my sunday mornings. it's quiet, peaceful, i have coffee and breakfast maybe throw on some cartoons from my childhood as some nostalgia and really just relax. yes i have hobbies that i do during the week as well, but there is just something different about a calm, chill, not going around vibe. what do you all try to do when it comes to a busy schedule and setting aside some relaxation time?",2

"how does an introverted, socially anxious, gamer adult like me make friends with people who feel like ""my crowd""?. i'm a 22 year old dude and i've been trying to get out of my comfort zone and meet new people. i'm in university and i've joined the student ambassadors. it's been good, i've met some fun people. but it remains a mere acquaintance. like i meet them at other events and we talk a little bit and that's all it is. it absolutely baffles me how fast some people have made friends. i was at a sa event and i was grouped with 3 girls and a guy. they somehow hit it off so well, fuckers are going hiking together, they're meeting up for lunch in school, the go for yoga together. in 1 month they've become best friends or something. but i was there too. what the fuck did i do wrong? ? i don't get it. throw me a bone please, i'm trying to make friends and stop being a boring, lonely loser but i can't. today i went to play football with a friend from class. the one person who talked to me in school. he plays football with a group of friends he knows from high school. i'm not very athletic but i'm working on it. so i sucked. and i felt embarrassed that i was bad. they're all fit dudes who watch football, they all go to the gym and have abs and then there's me. i introduced myself, had a little small talk about university life and shit. i keep telling myself they might just not be my crowd. but that doesn't console me enough. how do i find my crowd? it sometimes feels like the people i want to be friends with won't speak to me first because they are like me and don't want to speak me first either. that's the same way i feel about dating. i've never met a single gamer girl in real life, they're usually a lot more interesting than i am and wayyy out of my league. i'm just way too boring. i'm at a loss on what i should do to feel a bit more interesting. learning in instruments like other guys i know takes years, being fit, i'm already working on it, having interesting accomplishments or stories to tell people is hard unless ""i have 8 h in apex legends and i'm still not amazing at it"" is cool. sigh. thanks for reading if you did. would love someone to talk to.",2

"i'm autistic and i finally found my voice at age 26 . i would speak very rarely because i just didn't know how i should sound like. i know it's pretty dumb like i just didn't get how people had a ""natural"" voice because it made no sense to me. so finally at age 25 i realized that people's ""natural"" voice was actually chosen by them, though thier anatomy constrained their vocal range and made certain tones easier to produce, as for speaking style it was mimicked from those around them plus wherever else they heard speaking like tv and music. then i realized my wonderful freedom that most don't get, to completely choose what i wanted my natural voice to sound like. so i began to sing rap as much as i could i choosing a diverse array of voices of singers and rappers whom i liked and i would try to mimic their voice. and now when i speak, what comes out is a smooth, sexy voice. not too masculine or feminine, it's just right for my androgynous self. for the first time in my entire life i feel confident in speaking up i never thought this would ever happen i just wanted to share this to encourage others who don't like their voice, you can change it and if people ask why you sound different just tell them sexily to suck some donkey dong ",2

"habit of spacing out. when i'm bored or not doing anything, i like to stare into nothingness. sometimes, while listening to music. it's fine when i'm doing it in my room since i can go on for however long i want it to be. but after some time, it gets suffocating inside the 4 walls of what should be my safe space. so then, i have to go out atleast once a week to refresh my mind. either i go by the harbour, or the mall, usually the latter. my routine is pretty simple, go to the mall, eat, buy clothes once per month is what my allowance allows me to , and then finally rest in a coffee shop for a few hours before going home. i like coffee, not like a hipster, or a connoisseur, i just like it like the average person. i like it, but for some reason, it messes up something in me, like i become more aware of everything around me, or a feeling like something bad may happen to me, and then i'd feel like shit sick a few hours later. what i do like about it is the act of drinking it. i like taking my time when drinking coffee, it takes me atleast 1.5 hours before i finish one venti sized coffee. again, i like staring into nothingness alot, that includes when i'm drinking coffee. but unlike when i'm in my room, i can't do it in my pace, in public. because there's people around me. i know they're not looking at me but sometimes when they do, i know they're thinking that i'm weird staring into the void, alone. it did happen back in 9th grade, after our semester break, i remember going back to the classroom just staring into... well, nothing. my classmate noticed me from a distance and then he snapped me back to reality and saying ""hey, you've been zoning out for atleast 15 minutes now, are you okay?"" then i laughed and said yeah mb. i like staring into nothingness, i think its more meta than forcefully closing my eyes, somehow, that is more tiring. when zoning out i occasionally find out that i have been staring at someone without me knowing. thats why it messes me up. what if i was accidentally looking at someone? they will think im weird, im into them, and then what? ill end up in social media either having sad music and the caption is about a guy being alone, or a pervert staring at me. sometimes, i imagine having the power of clipping out of reality whenever i want, or being invisible. so then nobody would judge me for being weird and staring carelessly. i know i shouldnt care at all, im confident enough being alone, eating, or walking alone. i like being by myself because theres no constraints. i just wish i can drink my coffee in public and stare into nothingness without these thoughts.",2

"it finally happened. i love vegetables now.. to be clear, i never hated veggies. my parents god bless them made sure that we always ate healthy, but once i lived on my own i decided that veggies are optional especially during my college years, i never touched salads and got into some very poor eating habits even though i liked to cook. recently i started watching this show alone, and it blew my mind how much we take food for granted. folks on the show were starving even when they had meat, just because their diet was crazy imbalanced with proteins and barely any fat. it made me think about how i eat, and since then i just crave having different things in my meals healthy amount of carbs, protein, and veggies all mixed together. it's like a festival in my mouth every time i get a bite of meat with that crunch of fresh veggies right next to it. i fucking love vegetables now.",2

"can we talk about cereal?. i went to stop and shop today looking for an evening snack and thought hey you know what i haven't had in a while, breakfast cereal. i don't eat breakfast but i thought it might be a good snack when i come home from work since i can't eat much during the day there besides chicken some rice and broccoli. which sucks. so anyway going down the cereal aisle i was hoping to see some old favorites like honey smacks, french toast crunch or even corn pops which i was always on the fence about. but there was none of that. there was cheerios, 14, different fiber cereals, cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms. now i know all those fiber cereals are healthy and whatever and that's great but i eat healthy all week so i wanted to indulge a little. oh and i think frosted flakes were there but i never liked those. i think those pebbles were too. i just wasn't feeling it. so i think eh alright i'll check out the cracker aisle. but even there there's like a thousand varieties of ritz which didn't excite me. chip aisle has options but i'm a little worn out in chips plus its really unhealthy. so back to the cereal i went. i ended up with a cereal called krave which was like 5 and turns out it's mediocre at best. what was your favorite cereal as a kid and if you still have cereal do you miss the days when there tons of great options?",2

"are you a person who is more attracted to little details about an individual person, or a specific feature on every person?. to clarify, i am female, and attracted to anyone so long as they are my age. i tend to notice little details about an individual, and that clues me in to parts of their personality, which makes them attractive. for example, i might notice well manicured hands on someone who clearly works a messy or harsh job, implying they take extra care of themselves. my friend, by comparison, is a butt guy, and claims there are no bad butts. he doesn't care what they look like, and claims he can appreciate all of them. we jokingly disagree deeply on this. it's a running gag. while there are certain standards that the majority find attractive, i wanted to hear more about what each of you, as an individual tend to notice or if you have some kind of universal preference as my friend does. i suppose this really boils down more to a question if are you more attracted to everyone with a particular trait vs each person as an individual... idk, i'm rambling.

"how does time travel work?. i have been thinking about this a couple of times now this is mostly past related to make it less complicated : is there a feasable way to percieve time? we all know that time passes and can see it happen in front of us but can we really determine how time works? this would be directly linked ? with the concept of time travel i like this topic . the way time travel would or wouldn t work highly depends on the way time actually works: 1.a fixed timeline where everything that has ever and will ever happen has somehow ben predetermined, even occurences of time travel a good example for this would be the time watch thing from one of the harry potter moovies 2. no fixed timeline, your decisions influence the current state of your timeline, this can take various different forms: 2.1 its always one continuous line, time travel creates an infinite loop, you time traveling causes the version of you that time traveled to never have existed in the first place override of your timeline causing you to never have traveled to the past and change the timeline. 2.2 alternatively you could create a branch timeline no override where you decided to time travel to causing you to be an extra in this time since you re from another version of reality . this brings up the question if every decision you make or don t make branches off into an alternative timeline making it hard to pinpoint a time to travel to since there are almost infinite possible pasts to consider .",2

"i am finally proud of myself. i thought i can post it here expressing that i am finally proud of myself. i cant say that my parents abused me and they did they best they can to raise me but all they did my whole life was working so much that they never spend time to get to know me. they always thought i just want to be lazy, play video games, listen to music and just slack off my whole life but in reality, i really wanted a figure. i went to community college right when i turned 18 while still living with them and i still feel like im 12. felt like my life wasnt taken seriously to advance being an adult. i worked a lot but still didnt advance so i felt i had to dorm in a university to not only get college experience but to get away from my parents. i did exactly that at 23, lived away from them for 2 years and had exactly what i hoped. but graduating college at 25 was so depressing, i lived with my parents again because the job i had wasnt well paid and it lead me to depression because they thought i wanted to be lazy again so they tell me to clean and take care of the house while im not doing anything. a year of that and i snapped. i wanted to make the most incredible story of how i needed nobody but myself and start being an adult. i had two friends who were in a similar situation to move into the city so i took that as a sign to take the leap of faith. i lied to my parents saying that i had a friend who paid off 3 months of his rent, had to move so gave me permission to live in it. i couldn't believe they fell for it but still said it's a bad idea. i didnt listen and moved in with the little money i had. i then became a rideshare driver to make ends meet and it was an emotional roller coaster. i took side jobs that wernt full time, delivered food and online tasks all while still trying to find a reliable, full time job. i still went traveling to remind myself that i have purposes in life and it felt great. but then one day i picked up someone from rideshare and we had a great conversation. long story short, he was a manager at a hotel and said he can try to connect me with the department that's searching for the type of job i was looking for. i took it. it wasnt full time but it paid great to get me off rideshare. then that experience brought me to work at a hospital. then a an office that specializes sports clothing apparel and then it brought me to work at a start up tech company and now i am working it's competitor getting paid 8 k a year. next thing you know, i have a girlfriend, a house, a dog, and just a few months ago, a beautiful son. i did all this myself and respectfully without my parents. i still have more goals to accomplish but right now, im so happy where i am and cant wait to see what else i have in the future.",2

"my brother opened up to me today. my f16 brother m11 came home from his taekwondo class upset. it was obvious he was annoyed by something but i couldn't tell what. he didn't even tell my parents what was bothering him. later that evening when it was just me and him in my room he randomly started crying. he told me what happened in class today, that he felt our instructor humiliated him in front of everyone. and that he never wanted to go back again. now, i know my brother has always been a sensitive kid. so i asked him to tell me specifically what happened. he told me how our instructor was using him as an example in front of everyone, showing him how to correct certain stances and movements in patterns. as he does with many other students i reminded my brother of that, and he did realize that it was true. i brought up some examples, times where even he had laughed at his friends being called out, and we started joking about it. soon he stopped being sad and was doing better. i feel so honored that he trusted me to tell me this. he asked me not to tell my parents or to talk to our instructor about it so i don't really have anyone else to tell this to. it's kinda weird for me since the main relationship i have with my brother is just us fighting and we never really talk like this with each other. but i'm happy he's able to tell me things that bother him. edit: holy i made this post last night before i went to bed since i felt like i had to tell someone this but couldn't tell anyone and woke up to all of your support i really am so happy now. i have gotten the consensus that my relationship with my brother is a one to keep so i promise i will keep it with him. lt;3 thank you for reading this : ",2

"why do people during verbal debates always seem to interrupt each other?. most times i've seen a verbal debate not necessarily about something political, but just where people disagree it almost always just ends up with them competing to see who can yell the loudest. it happened a lot in my health class when we could discuss the ""question of the day"" that related to health in some way. it's particularly apparent in politics though. why is that? this isn't a question about who's right in a debate or whatever, the subject doesn't matter. people like being right, is it so hard to listen to another person's thoughts in order to properly address them? do you find yourself talking over others during an argument, too? i find it so weird. it seems like poor etiquette, the same way throwing insults is. how can it be acceptable for people to do that, and how do they hope to be taken seriously when they can't even conduct themselves fairly towards another person? it's a lot less entertaining to watch or be present for any kind of debate like that, too. where basically everyone talking just kinda melts down and stops listening.",2

"toxic environment. i've been around enough not so mature people to make me a little worried and insecure. i mean ""cool"" people who are classless or mannerless. not to sound pretentious or condescending, but it just sucks. these people think they are the best shit out there, and are super self centered, and they invalidate and gas light others so much. and they put others down a lot too to make them feel better about themselves. lately i'm starting to worry that a lot of people are actually like this or am i just getting too deep into a niche group of adults who aren't mature or have no reason to be mature and respectful. ultimately, my question is simple. is it cool okay admirable to be mature, respectful, and classful? note, actually ""cool"" people imo are supportive, aren't so judgmental, and are respectful to others. they are people who are focused and have a lot of class. in my opinion.

"memory foam mattress: the best and worst choice i ever made.. i got a memory foam mattress as a christmas gift from my parents that past season. those first few weeks with it in the cold were bliss and it was so soft yet firm. then the spring takes an extremely quick turn into a scorching summer and it becomes a deal where i occasionally wake up in a warm sweat and it also starts to sag in places though it firms right back up after staying off it for a few hours. admittedly a tmi thing but it s also made my slight hemorrhoid issues into more prevalent occurrences which is my biggest complaint. all this being said, i still think this mattress is worth it. those comfortable winter early spring sleeps with a cold firm bed really make your worries melt away. needless to say it seems my experiences with my mattress are going to be seasonally dependent but i m willing to take it all in stride. anybody else out there in a similar situation? how have you dealt with memory foam trapping as much heat as it does during the warmer months? as always any and all input is welcomed and thanks for reading ",2

"" when i see an elevator even now, but not enough to freeze me in place or anything like that. i guess the thing with elevators is mostly the fear of it getting stuck, with no network inside so you can't ask for help, and you sit there for hours. though depending on where you live, elevator service is usually pretty quick, and the chance of ""stuckage"" is quite low. what about you?",2

"for a few years, around 1997 2 1, people were really into using customized computer interfaces. why did that just go away?. for anyone who wasn't around at the time, people used to make and share all kinds of crazy ass, custom themes for their pcs. i was only aware of exactly how the process worked on windows 98 xp, but i understand that macos and linux operating systems from that era had similar support for themes. now, you might not even know what i mean by ""themes."" they were files you could download or make yourself that changed all kinds of stuff on your pc. it'd start with the colors of all your window elements, right down to different shades for the edges of the windows, the color of the taskbar, the background of the windows, the color of the scrollbar, the color of the background of the scrollbar, all the different text colors and fonts and every other little thing that could be colored. and then you got into every single different thing your mouse can do. custom mouse cursors for the regular pointer, the busy pointer, the text insert cursor, the little arrows for when you're resizing a window. they could be all types of shit. often they were insanely gaudy and ugly. and then you get into the custom sounds. everything that made a noise would be changed. and, just like the mouse cursors, that shit was also usually pretty stupid and impractical. like, you'd have a little ""ding"" sound in the standard sound set, but it'd be a whole ass line from a movie, in your custom theme. and, of course, everything would be themed around the centerpiece of the desktop background. but it didn't even end there, because 98 and xp allowed you to customize each folder with a background image. so your ""my documents"" folder could have its own background, which was applied by the theme. so, like, if you had a lamborghini theme, there might be a picture of a diablo on the desktop background, but then a countach on the my documents folder. and so on. i remember i used this one for a long time that was dragon theme. some kind of badass dark fantasy tm digital painting of a black dragon on the desktop, a weird muted brown and black color scheme, and a mouse pointer that looked like a dragon...and that bitch would start flapping its wings instead of the hourglass loading icon. and when you resized shit, the dragon would be, like, gripping the edge of the window with its claws. and the sounds were just cringe, now that i remember it. all kinds of wack ass dragon roars. but the best part was the sound it would play when windows started up from being shut down. for some dumbass reason, it was just an incredibly loud thunderclap sound. every time i was away from my computer for several days and plugged that shit back in, it would startle me to the point that i almost chipped a tooth from involuntarily jumping in my chair. shit...maybe i just explained why that shit all went away. because it was objectively lame. but it was subjectively fucking dope as fucking fuck, y'all. who else remembers using crazy ass themes? and why do you think everyone just stopped wanting to use them, to the point that nobody even complained when os makers stopped supporting them? i actually think linux mofos can still use all that crazy shit. but i ain't got the energy to fuck with linux. i mean, i've had a linux install before, but i've never gotten that far into it. but y'all discuss all this. yo, in case it's not obvious, telling us all about your favorite themes you used back in the day fits perfectly with the spirit of this thread and this subreddit i wanna hear about all y'all cringe shit ",2

"the song 'adia' by sarah mclaughlan resonated with me today. i've heard this song since i was a kid but i never really ""listened"" to it as in soaked in the lyrics. maybe that's because i was a just a child and didn't grasp the adult message. anyway i was doing some projects around the house and had alexa playing in the background. for me, the part that struck me was where she said ""we are born innocent ... believe me adia we are still innocent. it's easy ... we all falter ... but does it matter?"" the reason that struck me is because i think many people feel robbed of their innocence because of life experiences, mistakes, and hard times. it sounds like the singer is consoling someone that their mistakes or tough issues ""we all falter"" doesn't have to define them. they can still claim their innocence and not feel like ""damaged goods."" i think this is a powerful message for anyone but most importantly women, because i think this ""purity culture"" world we live in really vilifies women at times. so there's a need to take back innocence.",2

"ekiy d7 android head unit. ekiy d7 android head unit first impression some weeks ago i decided to order an android head unit for mine suzuki celerio: i didn't wanna spend much, so opted for a unit with an older chipset. yes i know they are outdated.... it came with an 9 inch 72 p screen, 2gb of memory and 32gb of storage. reverse camera was also included. also it included a cable, to connect the original usb port of the car. but that one somehow doesn't work with mine usb c phone, not sure if it's related to the phone or the usb port is simply an older type and it won't work with newer device's? haven't tested this, because i simply used the other usb connection. the device works fine, it's not super fast. but still not super slow: loading google maps takes a bit, but i don't see the issue. what i do see as an issue conserving the seller: they claim it runs on android 1 , but i did the fake device test and it runs android 8. so i already opened a dispute for that... other than that, i don't see many issues. but haven't had much time, to test it. because i don't wanna drain the car battery.",2

"we had a housewarming barbecue this past weekend and i handled most of the food and people loved it . i've never been much of a cook, my wife is fantastic, but i was always able to feed us and i am a bit of a burger connoisseur. for our housewarming i made up a burger blend of 1.5lbs short rib and 1.5lbs chuck, along with some tangy garlic pickles and a basic burger sauce of ketchup, mustard and mayo. i grilled them, along with some hot dogs, for lunch and carefully temped them to flip at the perfect time, toasted the buns, etc. big hit then for dinner, i had two whole chickens dry brining in the fridge, they got absolutely smothered in dry rub and cayenne and then put on my new smoker for about two hours, until they hit 165. shredded them in to a warm dutch oven and set up a sandwich station with various barbecue sauces, cole slaw, potato salad, hawaiian and potato rolls and it was a huge hit. everyone was praising the food and we have almost none left over. i'm pretty much on cloud nine about it ",2
"thoughts on tips additional fees. is anyone else experiencing something similar? two weekends ago my husband and i had lunch that automatically included a 3 ""restaurant charge"". this past weekend we visited a brewery that added a 2 tip on our total bill plus the taxes. that night we purchased our yearly white water rafting tickets and were charged an additional 7 ""booking fee"" for each ticket . i'm guessing this money is to pay for the increased wages salaries and losses accrued from the pandemic. in fact, that's why we visit such establishments: we want to ensure small businesses in our area succeed. unfortunately, with all of these additional fees, it's challenging to spread the wealth.",2

"i'm plotting against my friends in a minecraft server and i don't know how to feel.. so basically, my friends and i have a minecraft server. we share everything, that's kind of the point. recently however, i'm detecting change. 1. at first, everything was supposed to be shared. so basically, if you got emeralds for trading, doesn't matter if your saving, straight to the communal chest for everyone to use. this didn't last, and now we store needs in our inventory and excess goes to the communal chest. 2. one of our members seems a bit more nutty in the server, and bored with it in general. they're less likely to join than before, and overall are less enthusiastic about it. on the flipside, we might have another member soon. so i'm looking at this and i think a chance at a more individualistic server is likely, and maayyybbeeee some conflict???? so i have a master plan. i've hid some valuable stuff that i got myself and am hoping in a jam i can use it to give myself leverage if things go south. on the other hand, i could totally be over thinking this and may cause the downfall myself because i will just tug enough at the strings little by little to undo the entire knot. can someone help? am i overthinking this?",2

"it's bizarre, becoming an adult outside the country you were born in. i spent a good portion of my early 2 s in asia, mostly japan. i moved back to my home country us and i just feel off center. i've been back for over two years at this point. it feels weird to miss a country and culture that aren't my own. especially since compared to actual natives, i'm still very much a rube lol. but it's also weird because i learned how to ""be"" an adult in a different culture. when i was younger, i felt like a high schooler pretending to be an adult, but by the time i left, i actually felt like one. my parents left their country to move to the us, so i guess they understand that feeling, but there are tons of people from there culture here. they have a network. i have a few friends from those days that i can talk to, but we're spread out haven't seen each other in person since living there. i missed some major events in the us but was there for events in japan. i spent my time having fun in ways i don't think i would in the us just because it was generally though not completely safe for me to get around in groups or alone. so i've had to restructure a few things. i once lost the key to my apartment and just left the door unlocked 24 7 until i had to go on a month long vacation the keys are expensive and sometimes in the morning if it was really cold, i'd leave my car on with my purse inside. there's always a chance for crime, but, y'know. i'd never do that in the us though lol. nobody around me knows how november was the worst month in our town because farmers would burn their crops and fill the air with smoke for weeks at a time. or about the small restaurants in town with great staff and patrons. or how exciting it was for us to travel to the city and eat fast food. our small town had dominoes, but it was a big deal when we traveled further out and got to eat taco bell. i don't even eat it in the us, but that day was pretty wild. i know a lot of my feelings are just based on missing a time when i was young and having fun, but i'm still young and having fun now too. it would be nice to at least go to an izakaya with someone who's been to one before.",2

"do you have any smells that you have associated with specific memories feelings?. i've been thinking a lot about how memory and sense of smell is linked and i find it very interesting that simply smelling something can completely shift my mood. sometimes the scent reminds me of something tangible like some trees in my neighborhood that remind me of 2 2 and walking with my mother and girlfriend together a lot more than we ever did but other times they give me more of a feeling or put me in a certain mood. i wonder what the most common association that people make is? perhaps the smell of rain is universal but it's not really explainable other than a vague, melancholic nostalgia for me so can we really know? another scent that gives me an inexplicable feeling is lavender. it's somewhat positive, i suppose. but i want to hear everyone's thoughts. do you have any scents strongly linked to memories or to something that you can't quite pin down? why do you think we can have such strong emotions from smells or is that just me?",2

"i'm so glad i switched to linux. it's really silly and unimportant; none of my friends care, but i want to talk about it lol : i've been wanting to switch over to linux full time since i first tried ubuntu around 14 years ago. i had made a live boot disk in order to circumvent some parental controls that my step dad had installed on my desktop. i hated the look of ubuntu back then, but everything else about it was great; even on the live disk, it seemed to run better than xp on my weak hardware? through years of school and technical jobs and everything i always remained a windows guy. and like i felt really bad about not using linux but for some reason i felt too timid to actually swap over. i guess i was worried that i'd lose a bunch of data and have to change all my applications and stuff. then, about a week ago i committed to switching to kubuntu full time, like cold turkey. i realized that most of my data is stored on cloud services and stuff, and most of my applications are cross platform, so reinstalling the os is actually no big deal at all. so i just did it. there were a few scary hiccups and i also made some embarrassingly stupid mistakes in the process. but i got everything ironed out and i can already tell it was totally worth it. there are so many reasons why i feel like kubuntu is the way to go: bash is powerful and convenient; the filesystem is tidier; it's more secure; managing software is easier; you don't have to pay for it; the list goes on. kde plasma is insanely customizable. you can have any image, video, or even shader as a background. i had an animated ps3 background with 3 simultaneous taskbars and a wikipedia widget with a 45 degree tilt? the flexibility is bonkers. you can set it to make windows translucent by mousewheeling over them. you can configure the system clock to tell you to go fuck yourself. you can have numa numa playing upside down on a permanent loop in a desktop widget not a window . just normal plasma out of the box without installing anything weird or doing anything hacky. i really wish i had been a part of the ubuntu community sooner; i should've switched way back when i was a kid. i would've had so much linux experience and knowledge by now, and i might have contributed some cool stuff. i can see this underlying philosophy that's underpinned and defined a lot of linux development. but at the same time, i guess making the transition was probably a lot harder back then. it's just that now is a great time to switch to linux. like, with steam proton, i can still play all the same games that i was playing on windows. that wasn't really the case back in the day. so maybe i wouldn't have had the patience for it back then anyway. in any case, i'm really proud to run linux now i just wish i could say that without sounding so full of myself, lol : ",2
"most genuine moment i've ever had. this happened about 1 years ago when i was a street photographer as a hobby and i clearly remember this story like it happened yesterday. i used to go around my city and just shoot everywhere for fun. but one night i came across a homeless person. now usually, i never give cash to them for obvious reasons but if they specifically ask for food, i dont mind helping. at that moment i had a banh mi, which is a vietnamese style sandwich that i grew up eating. i only wanted to bring it home with me but since he was there, i just gave it to him and we part ways. i didn't think of that situation at all but i came back to that same area browsing around with my camera and the same exact guy ran up to me and happily said, ""hey you i remember you you gave me a sandwich like a while ago "". it took me a while because that was actually 2 months ago. i couldn't believe he remembered me. i was shocked and asked how he remembered and he mentioned my camera. he eagerly asked me where i got the sandwich because he said it was legit the best sandwich he ever had. so i walked him there and had a little conversation about random things. we ended up talking for 2 minutes or so. as we approached to the sandwich shop, i asked if he wants me to buy one for him but he declined and said, ""no thanks i had nice people spare me enough money today"". i was caught off guard. he could of saved that money but declined me. it made me thought if he was even homeless in the first place. but it happened so fast that i didn't even have a chance to process. as i walked away it definitely tripped me out but that really made me happy for some reason. to this day when i walk around the area or even eating the sandwich itself, i think about that gentleman. i haven't seen him in the streets since and i go around the area every few weeks. so it made me happy that he possibly left it and started living somewhere with a roof above his head. or maybe he just wanted to relocate. who knows? but thinking about my crazy and not so perfect life, this genuine experience makes me happy every time i think about it.",2

"does anyone else weirdly kinda enjoy living in an apartment where the walls are thin and you can hear people just living their lives around you?. a few months ago i moved into an apartment building that's a bit less expensive than the other parts of the city, so understandably this is a really international city anyway there are lots of immigrants from all over living here. before this i had lived with an older lady who demanded silence after 9 1 o'clock and would call the cops on people throwing a party at 11 pm, so it was a breath of fresh air to be able to hear my neighbors living their lives, cleaning, turning on water, playing music occasionally, and singing with their kids. luckily there's not much wild partying or fighting that goes on, it seems like the population is mostly just wholesome families. i thought i might get tired of the noise, but since it's nothing crazy, here i am a few months later still enjoying hearing the signs of life around me. i know you people probably have tons of stories of noisy neighbors that were legitimately annoying at best, but has anyone out there been in a situation where it was actually pleasant like i am? maybe i'm just not too sensitive to noise, idk.",2

"i feel better in my 3 s than my 2 s. my 2 s felt like i was chasing a dream. getting married, trying to get settled, securing jobs, raising kids etc etc. often exhausted, stressed, and actually felt unsettled with very little time to spare. socially i felt like i needed to really blend in with others. ironically i had little motivation to do anything other than work, sleep, and repeat and raising babies . physically i've always been a skinny guy. mentally i didn't think i was fun or attractive to be around happily married but when i said attractive, i mean i'm not someone people usually come up and talk to in casual conversations my early 3 s i realized i'm my own person and a sudden rush of motivation and drive existed that i never felt before. i ended up quitting a good paying job that was both stressful and draining. i started my own business and thought i should've done this sooner now i actually make more money, with less stress, and could do something i dreamed about doing happily with a great team. now my upper 3 s, i finally started working out because i'm way more motivated to do stuff and actually make time. important point here: i felt the drive before i had more time. physically, my body is more toned i think and i feel good about myself. i carry myself differently and even my posture changed. socially i don't try to blend in with the crowd but instead stand out not to be annoying or gain attention but to know who i am . mentally, i see myself with more confidence. now in my 3 s i feel that more random people talk to me unsolicited. i feel way more energy and desire to see and experience the world. i remember seeing a brett favre commercial awhile back for wrangler jeans and the quote was something like ""for guys who knows what it takes to get it done"". at the time i was like dude you're old. now i'm like yes that's me anyone else feel this way? i'll be in my 4 s soon and i'm actually not dreading it.",2

"will the streaming market crash?. let me start by saying i don't really use streaming services like netflix, hulu, etc. i prefer buying movies on either vhs, dvd, blu ray, or from the itunes store. and if you want my reasons, you can check out this old post of mine https: www.reddit.com r unpopularopinion comments ns9311 movietv streaming services are bs ?utm source share amp;utm medium ios app amp;utm name iossmf . but lately i got to thinking: are we on the verge of an industry collapse? just think back to the video game crash of 1983 and the dot com crash of 2 . video games and the internet were insanely popular during the early 8 's and late 9 's respectively, and this naturally led to everyone investing and trying to get a piece of the pie until it ended up collapsing in on itself. those two crashes happened due to different factors, but one key element in both instances was over saturation. and now, there's so many different streaming services to choose from that you don't know which way to look. and netflix the biggest of the bunch is starting to decline with multiple show cancellations and losing subscribers at an alarming rate. this could just be bad business decisions on their part, but a part of me wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a similar effect on other services in maybe a year or two. i'm sure streaming will survive just like video games and internet, and it'll learn from it's mistakes and adapt maybe going to just having two or three major services . then again, i could be wrong. i'm no expert on finance, marketing, or streaming, so i'm just being theoretical. what do you guys think? do you think streaming services will crash, or do you think they'll stay strong?",2

"just a slice of pizza.. i really wish that more pizza places would have the option to sell by the slice. like i get it, places like little caesars already have a really cheap pizza and everything but with just my toddler and i in the house we never finish a pizza before we have to throw it out. it s so wasteful. i would love to be able to stop by dominos, papa johns, little caesar s or wherever and just be able to buy a couple slices of pizza. i know a lot of gas stations have this option but 9 1 their pizza isn t that great. i just want to be able to enjoy it and not waste it. edit: i did not expect this to blow up for reference i do know how to heat up pizza, i do refrigerate and serve for lunch or dinner a few days after but pizza for me is a once in a blue moon thing because im on a weight loss journey. my toddler surprisingly won t eat pizza several days in a row even for one meal and i can t. my favorite it little ceasars where you can get a whole pizza for 5 dollars. i don t like cold pizza, but i don t mind it reheated in the microwave or air fryer. i hate how frozen chain pizza tastes reheated. but getting a quick and cheap hot and ready from little ceasars i still end up having a couple slices i have to toss after it sits in my fridge for 3 5 days and my toddler has refused it.",2

"writing your thoughts is stupidly effective to clear your mind. i've always been passionate about writing my ideas and thoughts on paper or more likely computer and i also try to write diary regularly but i guess i still haven't realized how useful writing can be for mental clarity and well being. last week was extremely burdensome for me because of so much big changes going on in my life. i was all the time stressed and anxious but the worst thing was that i couldn't even pinpoint the reason for it. at first i didn't feel like writing because i thought ""what is that going to accomplish? i'd be just ruminating even more with my worries"" but i'm glad i did. first of all i simply started to write down all my worries and i instantly noticed how it helped me to step away from my worries and see more clearly what is going on. secondly i started to naturally arrange my thoughts and problems in a better way. it was relieving to be able to name the feelings and write down the reasons behind them. eventually i felt like i understood myself better and the stress and anxiety faded away. i did this pretty much all the way through the weekend and i am just amazed how much better i feel. i feel like i can concentrate on things i enjoy and my vague anxiety is pretty much gone. i really hope this post helps someone else to relieve their stress after trying this out. lastly i want to give you few tips to make most of your writing sessions: 1. write down your worry thought or some idea related to that immediately after it occurs 2. take a look at your thought from different perspectives: reasons behind it, what it causes you to do, how could you solve the problem, is it really that big of a deal or important? etc. 3. try to arrange your thoughts and see how they connect to each other this helped me a lot . this works even better if you can visually arrange your text. 4. make a plan. it could be that you come to conclusion that your worry was insignificant or maybe you decide to change something in your actions. having a plan makes it easier for you to feel like you have control.",2
"i need to know if i m a bad person, please don t sugarcoat to make me feel better?. when i was around 18 years old, i went to a pub with a few of my friends. my old childhood best friend was there too. i was going through a phase were i had my hair bleached blonde and cut short, with an eyebrow piercing. and when my best friend saw me she looked me up and down and said why . at the time i thought she was being mean to me, especially because she always has opinions about me and my other best friend, and kind of gave show off vibes that she is better than everyone. that is how i took it at the time, and for some reason my reaction, and here it comes , was to pass by this other friend of ours and sort of like rub against him while passing, and then i looked at her. i have no idea what that meant. she gave me a really disgusted look after that. and i have hated this memory ever since. she removed me from social media and never spoke to me again. i sometimes feel like i m a terrible person for doing something like that. and when i remember this memory, it really brings me down. i feel like if anybody knew i did that no one would speak to me anymore. please let me know your opinions.",2

"favorite video game soundtrack?. title. not a specific song, but as a whole ""album"", which video games do you think have the best soundtrack? or perhaps not best, because that suggests objectivity. so rather, what's your favorite, say, top 5? bonus points if it's something underappreciated or less well known or talked about. you can also include a whole entire series such as mario if you enjoy all those soundtracks, or if you can't decide a particular entry from that series. mine: 1. metroid. the music in those games is really something special, the atmosphere is unparalleled and feels literally alive at times. this goes for many of the older games like metroid prime, which makes it even more impressive for the time, where video game music was less popular. 2. portal. i recently discovered the soundtrack on spotify and gave it a listen, and pretty much all the songs are bops. fast paced. they got beeps, they got boops. i feel like a collab between ""aperture science psychoacoustic laboratories"" even the name is great lol and daft punk would have been legendary. 3. hades. a fairly new game, but highly successful. surprisingly though, i never even heard of this game before, instead i discovered it through the soundtrack that i stumbled upon on spotify. best way i can describe it, is more like an acoustical version of doom. matches the fast paced greek mythological setting really well. it made me want to play the game, which i eventually bought and thoroughly enjoyed. 4. minecraft. i feel that most the music, especially the older tracks composed by c418 originally, are very underappreciated. although i don't want to call out individual songs much here, ""alpha"" is ten minutes long and thusly i think doesn't get much attention because it only plays during credits, which most people probably skip. but anyways, i believe the music perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being in a dream. 5. halo 3 odst. while i love all the halo soundtracks, halo 3 odst went for a jazzy vibe, i used to study to the ""rain"" song on repeat, otherwise known as deference for darkness. but, it also has some really upbeat songs in there for the day missions. the game in general has a far different atmosphere because you're a human rather than a spartan, and there's a mix of calming lonely night gameplay, and more epic day missions. it's one of those examples of a game where the atmosphere and music meet together harmoniously, they're almost inseparable.",2

"anyone else who has a disabled parent and how has their disability affect your life ?. hey y all , so basically as the caption reads my question is if anyone else has had a disabled parent since birth? why am i asking this question? well because my mother has been disabled since she was 1 year old, she had me when she was 27 years old. my mother suffered from a head injury which caused her to have seizures when she was a baby and be paralyzed on one side of her body, it s called a can t remember the first word hematoma. as she got older , she is not able to move her left side , and is left with blocked peripheral vision. growing up , my life was kind of harder with her because with her disability, she was not always able to understand some of the deeper meanings behind the things i needed as a child. so i always acted out and was considered the bad kid because i wanted her attention. then as i became in my teenage years things got extremely hard because all we would do is argue. now that i am older, our relationship has gotten a lot better, but besides that i d like to know others experiences on this topic i ve never met somebody else who s had a similar situation. for context behind the head injury my family claims to not really know what happened i ve heard multiple different stories such as , she fell out of her crib with the sitter , or my grandma and her were in a car crash, or they were at a picnic and she fell on some rocks, or her dad just abused her. my grandma claims it s the sitter one. but i m not sure. anyway let me know ",2
"i think i get why people overtake cars.. this happened today for context where i live there is essentially one road to get to and from work home etc. one to go in to town and one out. so i'm heading out of town in my moms cars solo whens she's in the car she's very cautious or nervous i would say even if i already have my license and everything. i was following behind this car going around 9 km h, this is fast in her books, and i would lean on the other side of the road to see if it was clear or bit cause i really wanted to overtake a car for the first time. after a while i get the chance and i go for it, just as i'm in the other lane i see a car coming so what do i do, i speed up, i'm going around 13 ish i think. i pass the car and get back in my lane, my heart was pounding, palms got a bit sweaty and adrenaline started pumping. it was ridiculously fun to overtake a car. probably won't do it again for a while and obviously quite dangerous but the endorphins it left behind is lowkey addicting. do you guys overtake often?",2

"as i get older in life, it seems as if my peers and family have grown more jaded, ignorant, and close minded. have you guys felt this exact phenomenon? esp the last few years of course.. covid certainly didn t help. but throughout the last few years it seems like everyone is really on edge. liberal left friends have turned ultra conservative. meanwhile, hardcore conservative friends have become extremely open minded. my family members have grown more divided and distant. my once cheerful cousins and family have been beaten down as they enter the workforce. but overall i ve noticed that people are much more hostile towards society. for instance, i ll ride around nyc with a friend to pick something up and we ll see kids in the city dancing or rapping, and they ll make comments like they need to go inside, read a book, instead of clogging up the roads. this generation is all about having fun and being accepting and shit i just shook my head with a smirk, but i m thinking that these kids are behaving a hell of a lot better than we did. and that guy used to be super accepting and cool. for example, growing up, we lived in a bad neighborhood with a lot of homophobia and he was one of the first kids to openly say i got no problem with gays, yall are clowns for hating on them cause they had no say in it, like us being born black . that s just 1 guy, 1 example right? no, this has been the overall sentiment i ve gotten from all types of people, from all different areas, from all walks of life. i know i sound paranoid, but i feel like facebook and twitter brainwashing has a lot to do with it.",2

"does anyone catch themselves zoning out a crazy amount?. i swear i didn't used to do this as a kid but i really started to notice it when i was high school, i'd just zone out on more than one occasion in the span of like 1 15 min. there was this one time where i was riding my bike and i zoned out for a good 6 seconds and basically crashed into my neighbors fence. i thought that once i graduated that it would naturally go away or die down my reasoning being that it was probably the stress from school or i was just bored, but if anything it's gone up even more now.",2

"people who follow celebrities' daily lives outfits etc, why?. i am just curious about this. i never did follow these actors actresses etc. are celebrities followers mostly teens? i think when i was in teenage years there seemed to be more people following the celebs. the people were sometimes sexually attracted to the celebs, or wanted to live their lifestyle, or were really into some hype. nowadays i check the ig, justin bieber, kylie jenner for example, they are just posting some selfies or simple photos, then there are millions of likes every photo. i don't quite get the appeal to the followers. why are these checking someone changing outfits or taking a selfie or whatever? i imaging such followers mostly to be young people who are not very self centered and not very self assured? if you are following some actors actresses singers' daily lives or checking their selfies etc, could you tell me why such caught your attention? i am genuinely curious.",2

"a band that was canceled in my country yet i didn't stop listening to them.. hi, just want to share the band i love to listen to who helped me during those days of being in the dark. their music helped me to reduce my stress and make me sleep easily. i know their band has a bad reputation because of the issue of harassing girls. but, i can t deny i can t cancel them because of what happened. i do not tolerate men when it comes to harassing or abusing girls. i just can t do it because of how much their music helped me from 2 18 to this present. listening to their music makes me calm and relaxed. i hate them for what they did but i can t hate their music that easily and stop them from listening. my friends even laughed at me and called out to me because they know i still listen to their music. i want to explain my side but it s hard. letting go is not that easy tho. i can t find a band that can top them. : ",2
"update: i did end up waking the marathon today. i feel pretty crappy right now but i m glad i did it . proof https: imgur.com gallery 2e1eqel yesterday i posted here that i would walk a marathon today. i have never trained for a marathon and i usually run about 3 miles a couple times per week. i m a bigger girl so by no means am i fit. but i am much better at endurance than speed. so i was pretty slow, averaging about 3 miles per hour. but that includes some breaks to buy food and to charge my phone. so probably closer to 3.15 miles per hour or a bit more. i tracked it with strava which ended up being about a mile ahead of my iphone health app, so i decided to walk the extra mile just to be sure. the first few miles were pretty good, around mile 2 i had to stop to charge my phone as well as put a bandaid on a blister. and around 24 i notices a rash on my legs. i think it s a heat rash cuz it was 1 2 f all day. anyways i m all showered now, and i m pretty sore. the part that got sore first were my hips. but overall i d say it s pretty doable thanks for everyone that encouraged me. and if you have any questions please ask ",2

"i d rather be alone. on the first day of school a new girl came up and sat at my table. we talked until the bell rang and we hung out at lunch and in science class. the next day we hung out a little, but at pe i saw her being way friendlier with another girl. it didn t annoy me obviously, i mean it made me happy because they seemed like good friends and it s only the second day of school. but i was sitting that day, all alone, at my table, and i just thought i love being alone . yeah it s nice and cool to have a big group of friends, and people you can hang out with and rant to, but i love being by myself. i love not having to worry to keep up the conversation, or to make sure i m good with everyone. i love people watching and talking to myself. i love laughing at my stupid jokes and not having to worry if someone finds it funny. i do have one friend, we don t go to school together, and we talk sometimes. but having one friend you barely hang out with but still have a good relationship with is amazing. most likely i ll have a partner in the future, but who knows. all i know is that right now im fine with being that quiet kid at the back of the class who is extremely awkward but answers questions all the time. i love people knowing my business and who i am, i just don t want to talk to you.",2
