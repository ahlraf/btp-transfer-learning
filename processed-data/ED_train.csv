"tw i miss being skinny. hi, i'm 23, i never really have been diagnosed with an ed, but i used to be super skinny, and i used to skip meals sometimes i wouldn't eat at all and just throw up a lot, just for the sake of being pretty and stop being bullied at school. my weight right now is not doing good though, i'm fat, and i hate it so much. i look thru old pics of myself on purpose, just to have a motivation to stop eating, i'm so tired of my body and i want to go back to the days where dating was much easier for me, now even my family remarks my body, it's just so frustrating. sorry for the vent post.",

"struggling in recovery. hey guys. im going to try and not mention anything that may be triggering, i just need to vent and hopefully receive some advice words of comfort. i ve struggled with an eating disorder for over a year now, and i was diagnosed with anorexia 5 months ago. i was recently in paris, where for a month i guess i just let myself go and ate what i wanted. i told myself that i wouldn t restrict myself and that all the walking would make it okay. i gained around 1 lbs. i got home, feeling fine, and excited for the rest of the summer. i spent a weekend with family where i ate a lot. i feel very guilty about it. i weighed myself today and i am 4 lbs heavier. so here i am, so anxious and scared over the possibility that i got that much heavier in one weekend. i feel scared and unsafe. i feel like i m in some sort of danger. i don t fit into some of my clothes anymore, and it s making me want to relapse. my thoughts won t stop and it is genuinely torturous. i don t want to ruin august for myself by worrying about food and i also don t want to hate the way i look and feel awful. but at this point it s too late. i wish i could be happy again. i got myself into such a mess developing this disorder that im so afraid i ll never see the light at the end of the tunnel. i want to be comfortable with myself but the little girl who didn t care about her large thighs is long gone. i ve been overeating these past few days and i just feel like i ve gained more weight than i should ve. i am no longer underweight which is good but i just feel like people will judge me . i don t look the way i used to. i don t look the way i could have.",
"my therapist said this was normal but i want to make sure. so i not entirely sure what subreddit this belongs in so i settled on this okay so i know the title sounds bad, but she s been wrong before and i don t think this is normal or healthy. so what happening is my eating habits are odd to say the least, like i already struggle with eating cause, ya know, that s why i m on this subreddit, but on top of that i get these weird food phases where i ll find like one or two foods that i can eat and everything else is utterly repulsive, like if i can t eat the food s of choice then i can t eat simple as that, it hasn t happened in a while tho, but it used to happen all the time, and i want to know if that s normal or no",

"i think i might need help?. ever since i hit puberty, i struggled with weight. when i was a kid i was incredibly skinny, but once i hit middle school i gained weight. i was never considered ""overweight"" based on the bmi, but i was definitely noticeably chubbier. a doctor i had during a physical openly told my mom during our appointment to maybe cut out meals or control my portion size so that i could lose weight when i was in middle school. i think that really stuck with me. i started binge eating more often which i didnt realize even constituted as an ed until i got older. then when i turned 17 i got an iud, and all of my hormonal cravings went away. since then, i've lost 3 pounds and am still rapidly losing weight. all the weight i've been trying so hard to lose for almost 1 years but havent been able to due to binging has just disappeared. i try not to base myself on the bmi, but all i know is i'm 5'8 and now approaching 115 pounds. i've completely lost my desire to eat meals, if not just not eat at all, and i realize i've become obsessed with the scale. i weigh myself over 1 times a day. when i do end up eating because my mom forces me i still live at home , i find myself getting anxious and trying to starve myself for the longest amount of time possible before i'm forced to eat again. i constantly count calories in my head and have become obsessed with seeing places like my thighs getting smaller and being able to see my ribs more. i'm worried this is going to turn into a problem. i dont think i can tell my parents because they always encouraged me to lose weight. now that im actually losing weight, they seem worries but i already know that theres no way that they would say i need help. theyd probably just think i was weak. i didnt realize there might be something wrong until i've recently been getting really dizzy and my whole vision goes white whenever i stand up or try to exert any more energy than just a walking pace. please i feel like i just need someone to talk to because i cant talk to anyone around me and am just trapped with my own thoughts bouncing around my brain.

"so sick of feeling like this. my entire life ive had issues with body image but only recently have ed symptoms started to get more frequent and severe i feel like i'm stuck in a rut, binge, restrict, binge, restrict, and even that time where i thought i had everything under control and i was eating normally for a while of course it went downhill, i ended up bingeing again, and eating anything started to become stressful again, i've been trying to get back on my schedule of 3 meals a day and eating something every 3 4 hours but it's just difficult now whenever i eat or feel hungry i feel disgusting and gluttonous i only see my therapist once every two weeks, and i can't ask for that to increase because my parents will ask why and if they know about all of this they'll just make it so much worse one of my new pe curriculum's primary focuses is weight, and i asked my therapist about getting alternative assignments when there was an activity about it but she said she needs parental permission to contact the school. even though she can give me a letter to give to the school, im scared that the school will need parental permission to alter my lessons and assignments i've joined 5 different vent based discord servers and they've all done one of 4 things: ""if you're overweight up your exercise and start dieting"", i already exercise for a huge part of the day, and i have too many issues with eating to be able to effectively diet, but nobody actually wants to help me with those ""you need to learn to love yourself"", i don't know how . that's part of what i'm seeking help on. but nobody wants to help me, they just want to tell me what i already know i once got encouraged by four people to restrict or they just don't ever respond to anything i post. i went on tumblr for any kind of help, i was in for a ride awakening. it's all pro ana shit or fetishization. there's a bot that came up, kokobot, but it says that it's not a safe place to talk about eds. i don't know why it popped up while i was searching various ed terms or why it has an option for eating disorders when it asks you what you're struggling with then, but it did. there are a few helpful tips there but they're all for anorexia and i think binge eating is my big problem rn and it's funny how whenever i talk about this stuff everyone always says ""it doesn't matter what others think of you, beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" but then i talk about how other people only ever talk about how i'm so beautiful or whatever and i just don't like the way i look, they say ""everyone thinks you're beautiful, so you must be"" or something along those lines. it makes me feel so invalidated, people only want to contrast my opinion of myself, and it makes me frustrated. imagine telling the truth and everyone just keeps insisting you're lying. that's how it feels. what's more, r eatingdisorders apparently doesn't allow fucking cries for help. i feel so, so rejected. i'm coming here because i feel like i have nowhere else. please read the whole thing and don't respond with some of the things i've listed that are frustrating. if you can't think of anything else i don't care i won't hold it against you if you just don't respond. i at the very least need some kind of effective comfort.",
"i think i m starting to develop an eating disorder. these past few months i ve noticed a decline in the amount of food i m eating. i was a chubby kid and i generally had problems with my parents saying i shouldn t be eating so much. i used to think they were just being cautious and i spent most of my youth eating quite a lot of food thinking not much of it. but these past few years, especially during the height of the covid pandemic i would often skip meals or only have them in smaller quantities than what i was used to. i didn t think much of it and just got through the pandemic. but then when we started to get back to normal i started skipping breakfast and started heading to school earlier. my father told me that i need to eat breakfast before heading to school as it would keep my energy up for the day but i ignored him and continue to do this for months. i think the first time when i started to realise that this is a problem was in late february when after school i would sit waiting around for my clubs, after school hours they did these evening meals i would often feel guilty about eating these evening meals and then i would not finish my dish. i then stopped eating my packed lunches and i would often throw away my sandwiches into the bin and only have a small bunch of grapes to last me for the entire day. it s not that i was forcing myself not to eat it s just i didn t feel hungry i didn t feel hungry for anything i didn t want to eat because i didn t feel the need to eat. then start to happen on weekends. so i will go being tidy sleeping for about 11 hours and then coming downstairs for a small piece of toast and then going up to my room and not coming down until 8 p.m. this carried on for months and the point where i realised this is an actual problem is when my school had a talent show and i refused to eat anything all day i did not have anything that day. this is when i realised that i probably have a problem and recently it s come to light that in fact i probably do because i this past week have been skipping almost every single meal of the day and just drinking water supplies i ve stopped brushing my teeth i stop heading to bed at a normal time. i sometimes go to bed with my stomach growling and then wake up the next morning with a growling but not leaving my room until about three hours later when i m at the point of serious stomach pains. i don t want to get my parents involved because i think they ll say i m overreacting about this but i honestly don t know what to do and how i can stop this before it becomes an eating disorder. i need to adress i'm not self diagnosing i'm just asking for warning signs.",
is drinking too much a symptom of my ed?. i know it s two separate issues but it s like they fuel eachother. at my lw i was going out every weekend and drinking more than i should have. i don t think they were related at that point but after i went through a depression and ended up gaining. now that the depression is over i went out last night without eating got drunk. came home and drank more. then i ate. now i m a lw again. i feel like alcohol just cancels out the fact that i ate.,
could ed cause hair loss?. im starting to lose hair and i just noticed. i skip meals and my diet is horrible because of my bitch ed. im always incredibly stressed because of being abused especially about my appearance because i have a messed up image of myself. i want to know if this could lead to hair loss and if anyone has some experiences they can share. i have no one supporting me. i will be seeing a specialist but im depressed rn and im isolating myself because of the sad state of my hair. i cried for 3 hours straight.,
"so frustrated. so my wife was accepted into a php at rogers in wisconsin. she was supposed to start monday. we were so hopeful that she is finally admitting she needs more help and getting it. she did her labs today and her phosphorus level came back really low. rogers called back and said they can t take her into the php and she would have to do inpatient. ok, fine. here is the catch: inpatient wait list is 2 4 months. so instead of starting monday we have to wait until at least october my wife realizes she has a problem and is trying hard for help, but now she has to wait up to 4 months to get help because she has a low phosphorus level why does our health care system make people who are in more need of help wait even longer? ? i am so mad, sad, and incredibly angry right now.",
"considering recovery. this was supposed to be me asking for advice, but it kind of turned into me rambling venting. so, if you dont want to read all of this: if anyone has experiences with getting professional help for your ed and committing to recovery, and maybe knows what to expect when turning to a mental health clinic about it, please share long story short, i want to recover because im tired and exhausted and im worrying my family, but i dont know where to start getting professional help. long story long, my ed seriously started in october 2 21. i have lost a fair amount of weight since then and went from a healthy weight to being underweight. a couple months in, my parents started getting really worried because they had noticed me skipping meals and losing weight quickly, so they kept a close eye on me which forced me to... ""recover"". lets just say, my mindset around food did not change a bit, and whenever i ate ""unhealthy"" foods or just bigger portions, i would still feel awful and beat myself up over it. still though, i ate, and so after a while my parents thought it was over and i was better. i relapsed really badly when i noticed they stopped caring. i noticed my weight gain and began restricting heavily again, going to more extreme measures than before. this also went on for a couple months, bringing us to today. as i was making my breakfast, my mom came up to me and said she was worried because i looked so thin i usually wear baggy clothes, today i wore a regular shirt. she started tracing my bones etc through my shirt and i could tell it really upset her. later, she sat me down and had a big long talk with me about my relationship with food, and whether i was losing weight on purpose. eventually i gave in and finally started being honest about it, in a very diluted way i did not go into detail but i mentioned that maybe i do restrict to become skinnier. she asked me if ive talked about it to my therapist, which i havent unfortunately, my therapist is on vacation this entire month, so even if i wanted to, i couldnt get professional help from her. my mom offered to take me to a local mental health clinic if things got too bad. i know this is really worrying and stressful to her, especially because she was pretty much oblivious to it for a long time, and now its this whole serious situation that i didnt even want it to become. anyways, i told her id be fine on my own for now, but im not so sure if thats true. i have been considering recovery for a good while now. i hate that the only thing on my mind is food, i hate that i cannot enjoy any events at any time of day because im constantly worried about what im going to be eating. i miss food and i miss having fun and i miss not caring. and now, on top of that, i have the added burden of being the problem child and worrying my lovely and supportive parents for what feels like no good reason if i continue my disordered behavior. so at this point, i want to recover. but i dont think i can do this alone, at home, with no supervision or professional help whatsoever. sure, i could wait until my therapist is back, but she doesnt even know about all of this. itll be overwhelming and take long enough to even tell her, and i dont think anything will come from it immediately. but i dont know if i can keep living like this at this point in time, i feel awful, my family feels awful, i feel so exhausted from just everything. however, i feel like if i went to this nearby clinic, i wouldnt be sick enough to receive any treatment. im so, so afraid that im making way too big of a deal out of this, and that theyd dismiss me and send me back home because, i dont know, maybe i look healthy enough or maybe they dont consider someone who eats two meals a day as anorexic, because theres people who eat less. i also have no idea of what to expect if i go there. all i really want for now is to talk to someone about it and see what they have to say from a professional standpoint, but i dont know whether theyd just prescribe me calorie supplements, or if id receive treatment and have to stay there, or if id just be sent home and be just as clueless and hopeless as before. i just dont know what to do. : ",
"im active in 3 4 dedicated ed subreddits, and none of them are as triggering as one that people think are ""healthy"". r fasting is genuinely the most triggering subreddit i have ever been on. everyone claims to be doing it to be healthy and lose weight in a healthy way, but people are fasting for days and egging each other on, providing tips that are more pro ana than ive seen on even tumblr. and whenever someone says they're having a hard time, they tell them to keep going ""it gets easier after 36 hours"". i had to leave the subreddit because oh my god??? it's terrible.",

"in ed recovery, now watching my bff descend into it...i don't think she can be in my life. burner account here, and this is a rant. tw on behaviors, numbers, etc. but the question is: can two people with eating disorders be friends? i have battled with disordered eating on and off throughout my life. i'm in my early 4 s now. you'd think i would have this figured out by now. about 4 years ago, i dropped down to a dangerously low weight. but, as so many of us have experienced, the ""you're too skinny"" was a welcome compliment. i was accomplishing something. i was proud of my xylophone ribs and all the rest . i relished my routine of exercise, eating ""clean,"" wearing tiny sizes. i've had a lot of shift in the last year and started to slow down on the exercising, eat more normally. it's part of my pattern. at some point, the heart palpitations and aching bones just suck. i can't keep up the rigor of that routine. but it's not that i don't want to...which is the disordered part.my best friend of 2 years decided she wanted to get a ""revenge bod"" last summer. and i saw all the signs; obsessive exercise, tracking her weight on her bathroom mirror, eating little to nothing, getting angry when other people weren't eating, getting angry when anyone questioned her behavior. ostensibly, she says she is the ""healthiest she's ever been"" yes, training for a marathon while also, you know, smoking. but worse, is that it is all she talks about; how much weight she's lost, how much she's exercising, her ""veganism."" she coaches other friends on how if they just worked out they'd be so much happier. she's ""happy"" because she's skinny. i think she is doing a ton of damage...i think she is bulimic, as well. she has a history of that behavior. she's downing tums constantly, complaining of heartburn.i finally talked to her about how i knew what she was doing, and while i loved her and wanted her to be happy, i know this is self destruction and i can't be a part of it. she accused me of being toxic and unsupportive and, of course, jealous.can two people with this struggle be friends? are we really going to sit across from each other at a dinner and judge what you're eating v. what i'm eating? am i going to have to look at you dying for me to tell you how skinny you are, when i think you look sick? or better, tell you you're too skinny and see that same gleam i used to get when people said that to me?do we just put aside 2 years of friendship, being with each other through marriages, divorces, kids, parent's dying, because this disorder is now always sitting at the table with both of us and i'm triggered as hell?",

"don t want to get better. tw numbers and talk about weight and loss don t read if you are struggling. reader have been warned.. i don t want to get better. i don t want to start eating food in a normal way. honestly i am tired of people telling me to eat. i don t care. i want to see the numbers go down. i crave the effects it has on my body, good or bad. i can manage fainting or loosing hair. i ve lost way to much to stop now. i really shouldn t be posting this and i hope i don t upset anyone but i just need to get it of my chest. for every kilo i loose, the prouder i get. the feeling of maintaining a number or ever lowering it is the best feeling ever. i can t explain it, it s euphoric almost. the rush of emotions i get when i see my shoulders getting pointier or my thigh gap which i didn t have before getting larger, my rib cage becoming more pronounced is just enthralling. i want to loose more, and fast. when i started this journey i had just begun taking my adhd medication. the elvanse helps me suppress my hunger and acts like a two in one diet attention pill, which is great in october of last year i was slightly over weight, but as i started loosing more weight i reached my first mile stone. 5 kg was a really safe spot for me as i had gotten to the weight i was two years ago. but as time passed on, i started to realize that i wanted more. i wanted no i need to be smaller. i ve now lost 3 more kg since then and i want to loose more. no one can change my mind. when people tell me that i am getting too skinny or being worried that i have relapsed again, i feel so happy. that means that it is noticeable enough to to see progress. telling me that i am too skinny or sick looking is not a wake up call. it s a reward, a compliment if you will. i ll never be disappointed to hear how small i ve gotten. my friend keeps calling me anorexic. i don t believe that i am but the thrill of hearing someone compare me to that of someone who has lost severe weight and who is dying of the disorder. i don t want comments telling me to get better, i know what i m doing. there s no point, because i won t stop. i apologize if this has triggered anyone and i m sorry if you are going through a heard time. i really just needed an outlet to talk about this.",
"help. trigger warning: health issues, test results, mental health so i've always had a bad relationship with food. for as long as i remember i've over eaten to the point of feeling sick and hidden food in my room so that nobody knew how much i was actually eating. my mother used to comment on it frequently but ofcourse that just made me hide it better. for a year or so i managed to really focus on exercising and eating healthily, almost entirely cutting out snacking. then i had a child and snacking was more convenient. for the last few years i have continued to gain weight. ive had many people comment that i should actually be alot bigger than i am because of what i eat and how much i do eat. i have some preexisting health issues so i had noticed that my pain levels have increased and i live a pretty sedentary lifestyle which isnt great but i thought that was just down to my pain. now i think that the bingeing, then gaining weight, is actually what has increased my pain and in turn made me struggle more with activity. i also noticed that im more breathless and getting sick more often but didnt think much of it. que to most recently ive been suffering with some stomach issues that we are struggling to find the cause of. i do have scans soon but recent blood tests revealed some deficiencies that are mainly caused by malnourishment. i am so exhausted all of the time and it is making me depressed. i cannot believe that my eating is causing all of this. and to make matters worse, im still bingeing probably more so i feel sick every night at bed time because i spend hours consistently snacking when im not even hungry but i cant stop. is there any hope for me?? anyone got any tips? tldr : bingeing is causing malnourishment, worsening health issues and making me depressed and fatigued. any advice?",
"guilt after eating anything, not exercising before or after eating, the possibillity of eating too much. it's so strange and exhausting. due to medical reasons i had to change my diet and lifestyle and from there my relationship with food has good downhill. now it's not only about fear foods or restricting types of foods, it's also guilt over eating even if it's ""healthy"", anxiety over not exercising before and or after every meal, worry over eating too much. it's a constant thought process i can't get out of, i just don't know what to do. i wish i could go back to the times i did not feel like this at all, could just eat and enjoy, now after every bite there a running thought of how many carbs or fat or protein i'm having, if that extra broccoli is too much, how much time do i have to walk after eating, etc, etc. i'm so tired of it, yet i think this is my life now forever.",
"how far is too far?. i d been at a consistent weight of 125 lbs i m 5 9 f for about 3 years, and i ve always been complemented on how skinny i was. i had a healthy relationship with food and i was happy. then the skinny complements stopped coming and everyone started complaining about bloating and how much they ate and their weight and how fat they looked in certain clothes, etc. i started noticing things i hadn t before like how my thighs touched and how when i ate my stomach protruded out. so i decided just to stop eating 3 meals and 2 snacks a day and cut down to 2 meals and one snack, i kept eating less and less from there and now 3 months later i eat one meal of less than 4 calories a day and even then throw it up a lot. i ve lost 1 lbs and all previous muscle but i still feel fat and overweight. my hair has started to fall out and i m constantly dizzy, but i can t make myself stop. i m obsessed with seeing that number on the scale go down. so now i write this post after i threw up my dinner and i ask you, how far is to far?",

"i need help, someone to talk too amp; im kinda embarrassed to post this. so idk if anyones going to read this but like i m trying really hard to recover and i have been doing semi okay the past few months but the urge to control my food is overwhelming. recently i just relapsed like super hard i ve been bingeing 3 times a day and purging at least twice. i was anorexic and bulimic in the past year and have dealt with this since i was 16, i m 22 now. i don t want to relapse everyone thinks i m doing so much better and i m fixed and i don t want to tell anyone bc i know they ll be disappointed. i ve just never hated my body so much before and i feel so trapped. i wear sweats and huge t shirts everyday and i haven t looked in the mirror truly in about 7 months, i close my eyes whenever i shower so i don t have to see my body and every guy that tries to talks to me i ghost bc i don t want them to be disappointed by my appearance. i also work out upwards of 3 hours a day. another thing to note is that i ve never really gone to therapy i tried once but therapy made it worse and my mom doesn t think i need a psychiatrist. i think i have kind of a toxic family for context when my parents first found out i was purging i remember her screaming from the top of the stairs how stupid i was and then threatening to tell my entire family if i didn t stop. i had to send her an article of what not to say to someone who is struggling with eating bc shes told me the most horrible things. i feel like i m losing control of everything. i just want to love my body but i don t think i ever will. i also just want someone to talk too i feel like i m so alone in this. my ex best friend replaced me bc she said it was too much for her and my friends now just kinda brush it off. i also can t talk to my parents bc they don t really like talking abt that stuff. so i guess this kind of turned into a rant, i just feel so alone right now. i myself and i don t know how to fix that.",
"do i have an ed. i've always been overweight, i still am and i've always hated myself for it specifically starting when i was 6 . when i was 9, i was put in this programme in school where i have to run during recess until i reach a certain step count, then i can go eat. that made me feel sm worse bullying. when i was 11 i started feeling embarrassed eating near people or wearing certain clothes. i hated shopping for clothes because when i had to try them on, most of the time they wouldn't fit. when i was 13, i tried starving myself but ended up stopping and i gained like 1 kg within the year. at 14 last year i gained another 6kg which made me feel extremely embarrassed so starting this year i tried losing weight. i tried doing exercises and calorie deficit but it had almost no change at all. middle of this year which is now , since i'm busier with school i have less time to eat then i realised i was losing weight i weigh myself everyday then i started starving myself for whole days or some days only drinking drinks aside from water and now, whenever i see food and feel hungry, very insulting and harsh thoughts come to my mind that make me feel like i shouldnt eat. the worse part is that because it's actually working better than a healthy way of losing weight, i don't can't stop. its been 2 months and i've lost 8kg. the reason a bit of me doesn't feel like its an ed is because im still overweight and i'm not like very scared of food. i also dont force myself to vomit. so idk ",
"i almost fainted in school.. if family shaming or anything like that triggers you, then please don't read my post. stay safe guys, and remember that you are more than your body. i 15f, have been suffering from weight problems ever since i was 7 years old. my family would and continues to til this day comment on my weight. i was the elephant, the fatty of the family. almost everyday my weight was brought up, and it had began to ruin my self image, and my relationship with food. at school, while no one ever said anything to me, i felt so ugly and out of place amongst my classmates and friends. i was envious that all the girls were skinny and pretty, but no one ever called me fat at school, so i was okay. i ate my food, played with my friends, read in the library, etc. in year 5, i began stretching and all my family members began to praise my now thinner body, and for a while, i was the happiest, most carefree girl i had ever been, but soon it began to stress me out, and i began to binge whenever i was stressed. i gained weight, i stopped stretching, and my mental health suffered for it. whenever i'm stressed, i either stress eat, or i avoid eating. i began giving my friends my snacks, i shared my fruit with a friend, and i'd throw half my sandwich out. i told my mum that i ate everything at school and was too full to eat dinner. i began to hyperfixate on walking, and soon anything could set me off and i'd be bawling my eyes out. this week, i began to feel dizzy, and would fall over randomly. my face lost its colour, and it was hard to stay awake. one day, i fell down, and i had to fight the temptation to just pass out. my friends forced me to drink water, made me sit down, and watched me like a hawk. that's it i guess. i feel like i might have an eating disorder but i'm not sure.",
i cant tell if i relapsed or if i'm just especially insecure. i started purging again and i'm really unsure if it's cuz i relapsed. it'd happened before that i would go a few days of purging then stop but my body image is just getting worse. honestly i'm too tired to try to find out but i cant stop purging and i cant stop seeing myself as fatter and fatter,

do i have an eating disorder?. i have generalized anxiety disorder. this i know for sure. i m diagnosed and on medication. however a symptom of my anxiety is loss of appetite. i ve never really thought about it until recently when i was reading a book and a character who has gad would stop themselves from eating whenever they were extremely anxious because it made them feel like they were in control and it made me wonder. i have no motivation for not eating. i m very happy with my body. if anything i m a little too skinny as i have a high metabolism. i m not trying to change my body when i don t eat. i just simply can t bring myself to eat because my anxiety makes me lose my appetite. i also generally just don t eat that much. 1 2 small meals a day. although i am trying to work on this and i m a big snacker. the worst was when i had went through an extreme traumatic episode and i essentially ate next to nothing for almost a month. i was extremely underweight and got very very sick. i didn t link the two together until recently. i m wondering if this counts as an eating disorder or is it just loss of appetite?,

"how josh peck overcame his addiction to food drugs. so drake and josh was a huge staple for me growing up for me. it was one of my favorite shows. until i read josh peck s book, i really didn't know much about him, but i resonated a lot with the fact that he was overweight, was this awkward goofy kid to losing the weight and getting a girlfriend. you really see him change throughout the show. and i just felt like i resonated with that a lot. and after reading his book i learned so much about addiction to food. i learned how my addiction to food may have affected my own life and why i even had it. so if you're struggling with addiction or if you've struggled with addiction, i hope this post resonates with you, and i hope you gain some value from this. and i above all want you to read his book. so growing up, he was just like me. he had a single mom and his dad left him. and i think that may have created some abandonment issues in him. and left him feeling like he wasn't enough. he implies that in the book. and i definitely feel the same way. that's just speculation. but i can say in my own life that this insecurity definitely played into my addictions. growing up, josh was in love with food. and for me personally, i don't remember being in love or addicted to food, until specifically, there were traumas that happened, like my dad leaving or other things. the moment i got fat was the exact same time that these traumas happened. i didn't really put the pieces in together until later on in life, which is kind of crazy. and josh used food to cope with these emotions. he used it to feel good. and the central theme of their entire house was food. so much so that his mom, who also had an eating disorder, would constantly be on a diet, constantly fluctuating weight. they would also binge together. they would go out to a restaurant and then they would get a bunch of snacks. and then they would go in their own rooms in their house and binge eat. and to josh, it was fun. he was just a kid. he was just like, yeah, this is just the way life is. but obviously that's a very unhealthy relationship to food. so at josh's prime, he weighed 297 pounds. in his own words, he said he would've had to have been six foot 1 and from samoa for this weight to sit correctly on his frame. now i didn't get bullied a lot for my weight, but i was overweight. i was obese, but i wasn't that bad, but it was still something that i hated. and i tried dieting and i couldn't lose it. it was so frustrating to try to lose weight, to feel like you don't have the willpower, to feel insecure about the way you looked and just not be healthy. and i wasn't playing sports. i. wasn't one of the cool kids . i felt very disconnected from my social circle or my group in school just like josh. he said it was way worse because in the nineties being overweight just meant open season. like everyone's gonna make fun of you cuz there was no anti bullying campaign. there's no body positivity back then. and what's worse is he weighed way more. it was a huge pain point for him, and i know a lot of overweight people can resonate with that. he describes it as this downward cycle. you're fat. so you get made fun of, and you feel shitty about yourself, which makes you eat more to cope with your bad emotions, which makes you more fat and so on and so forth. and on the bright side of all this, all this eating and teasing gave josh a really good sense of humor. and what he meant by that is he would compensate for his insecurities with laughter with jokes, with being funny. he said that if he can make you laugh, then maybe you won't make fun of him. matter of fact, if he can make you laugh, maybe he can control the entire conversation or the energy in the room. comedy to josh was a superpower. there's a quote from the book that i really like. and it says, the reason why people are funny is usually not funny at all. and i know a lot of people from books that i've read that are funny because of their insecurities, for example, will smith. he became such an entertainer because he wanted to ease the tension at his home because his father was very abusive towards his mom. he was getting bullied at school and in his own words, you can't be mad, hateful or racist when you're doubled over laughing. eventually josh would have to face this aversion to himself and actually be himself instead of a character, but that's gonna come a lot later in his life. in the meantime, him being funny, turned into not only a passion, but a career. he was doing standup comedy at eight years old. he started doing commercials, getting gigs for movies, small movies, big movies and as we all know, eventually a whole tv show with his name on it. he started getting paid and his mom and his financial burdens were being alleviated through him. he started paying the bills. he moved them all out to cali, all from this passion of comedy that was created from this insecurity to feel good enough to get validation. and i think it's so incredible that out of all of this pain came something really good. if you ever get bored, just watch some highlights of that show and you'll see that it was really a funny show and there's a reason why it's still playing today. they ended up filming 6 episodes and two movies. and over the course of the whole series, he loses 127 pounds. the fact that the entire weight loss journey was documented on tv made a lot of people, judge him for losing weight. isn't that crazy? like, can you imagine, sir, can you, uh, not change your character, please just stay unhealthy and be considerate because we're all wanting you to stay the same. people were objecting to him being healthy and improving his life. but, in his own words, because he lost all of the weight, he started doing drugs. losing the weight didn't change his mind. it only changed his body. this makes a lot of sense to me because when i eventually lost my weight, that's kind of, when i started doing drugs and fell into other addictions the addiction to escaping myself, didn't go away. merely the food part was under control, but even then i was still fluctuating weight a lot. i had my weight under control. but there was a lot of binging and dieting and binging and dieting. that was just simply the same broken brain in a new body. it was just never stable. i even remember a lot of my friends saying, danny, you lose weight and gain weight very, very frequently and very fast. for josh, he was 18 years old. he had lost all of his weight. he was in control of his eating. he had quote unquote made it. he had his own hit tv show, making money, things were looking good. the future was bright, but his brain hasn't caught up to his success yet. he had a broken brain in a new body, and this is when he started using drugs. so he started using drugs for the same reason why he overate to escape that feeling of being him. and i'm starting to realize that any addiction that i might have is just because i'm not confronting me. and i'm avoiding myself through external things through external pleasures. he did cocaine for the first time when he was 18 with his girlfriend, he just did it to feel normal and fit in. and when he first did it, he said he didn't feel anything. he said he guessed it didn't work. he went to a party. he was extremely social. if anything, he just felt like himself. and that's the crazy part. the drugs made him feel like more of himself for the first time. he didn't feel the pain of just existing. he mistook being high for being alive. imagine carrying an invisible backpack full of pain and trauma, your entire life. and then drugs are these magical potions that can make the weight of that backpack instantly feel lighter. he had been searching for a medicine like this, his entire life. the lie we tell ourselves is as i am, i am not enough. and that night for him doing drugs for the first time, he felt like enough. and the change was subtle. it took a few nights just like that before he noticed a change, he felt like at first he was in control. and i totally understand that because in my journey i've done drugs and i felt like they were helping me. i convinced myself, they were making me more social, more confident, a better person. when in reality, they were doing the opposite. they were just crutches for not feeling like i was. in his head, he was getting relief. and for the next four years, he was chasing that feeling of being okay. of being enough. and he ruined a lot of opportunity in the process and to backtrack a little, how did josh lose the weight? what was the secret? there was no secret. diet and exercise, baby. he just did it. and that was the same experience for me. one day i came home from a very long vacation and i'd gotten the most fat i had ever been. i was straight up obese at that point and everyone was making fun of me. i grew up from an asian household and they're very vocal about your weight. and i remember there's was a family friend that i had a huge crush on and she grabbed my cheeks and she said, danny, oh my god, you got so chubby. and in that moment, my heart shattered. that same day, it wasn't even a decision or a goal. i just started running. i just stopped eating. i lost the weight. here's my theory. when the pain of staying the same hurts more than the pain of change and discipline and willpower and transformation, you will change. at that moment of just straight pain, both josh and i just started working out and doing the work day in and day out. but here's the problem. one addiction can easily replace the other. what's more important than fixing your diet or putting a bandaid on your problems is fixing your mind and figuring out the place that the addiction is coming from. if you don't fix the insecurity and the feeling in your, in your mind, you won't be happy. you feel like you won't deserve to be. no amount of validation or external things will help you. and this is when josh realized. the drug addiction was out of control. for a six week period, he worked on this movie called the wackness. it was a role of him being a drug dealer and trading drugs for therapy to this crazy therapist. and the role was so perfect for josh and he was working with some of his favorite co stars that he actually quit drugs for six weeks just to shoot this movie. and during the showing, they won at the film festival, they won a bunch of awards. he got a standing ovation. everyone wanted to interview him. and all he wanted to do was go home because he hated that he felt like he didn't deserve any of it. he didn't feel like he deserved to win. and it was after this that he realized that he needed help and he started going to aa. he started going to meetings. he started getting accountability. and he got off drugs sober, and he found a community that supported him. but more importantly, they understood him his pain and his trauma. and while he was in no way fixed from just being sober, he says that it was the start of his journey of self actualizing and accepting himself. reading this book has made me realize that for addiction, it's important to look at the root of the addiction, the cause. and it's forced me to look inward and ask myself. why? why am i craving that thing? what emotion am i trying to cover up? what am i running away from? and for me, i'm constantly running away from my emotions and what i'm feeling and as time goes on, i'm getting much better at identifying when i'm in a rut. and when i'm not feeling good mentally, i d rather just sit with that emotion and not let it control me to make an impulsive decision that i don't even wanna make. one thing that i ve done that helps a lot is meditation i ve done a 2 hour a day meditation challenge, and it opened my eyes a lot. i have a video abt it on my yt. and basically that's me being proactive with myself saying every day, i'm actually gonna set aside time, focus on myself and my emotions and make sure i'm good before i go out and grind and do things. and maybe i sit with myself and realize i need to stop. i need to slow down. i need to take a break. so guys, i hope you gain some great value from this. and i so enjoyed reading this book and shooting this. so thank you so much for watching guys, peace.",

not very proud of myself. massive tw: talk of amount of food eaten ok well no one is going to see this bc my posts always get ignored buuuut i only ate 2 pieces of corn bread and two small bags of cheese itz today : ,
"triggered by ongoing physical illness. tw so i ve been sick for like a month and half at this point. first 3 weeks of constant excruciating migraines i have chronic migraine that that made me throw up multiple times a day. then i developed severe and near constant vertigo for unknown reasons that also makes me really nauseous and makes keeping food down a challenge at times. i had a uti at one point, so i could only drink water and couldn t have sugar. when i stepped on the scale yesterday, i was shocked, confused, terrified and proud. i d lost x pounds in a week. more than i can ever remember losing while actively engaging in my eating disorder. much more than is healthy. i have no appetite and when i eat i get full extremely quickly now, so it shouldn t surprise me how much i ve lost. but now i feel the need to lose even more. if i keep losing at the same rate, i could be a weight i m happy with in two weeks. and it doesn t even sound out of reach, because i m still so sick and eating is hard even when i want to. idk. i see my therapist tomorrow, and i m going to tell her everything, because i don t want to full blown relapse. but my body won t let me eat enough, and i know it s messed up, but i m kind of excited about it.",

"i have bed and i m jealous of my identical twin sister s anorexia. i know i shouldn t be but i am. i know i will be accused of glamorising romanticising anorexia and i feel really bad about that. i can t help but be jealous and here is why . i am 5 8 and 145lbs. which is not obese but i feel fat. i feel so fat. when i wear jeans, some flab hangs out from the top of them around my waist . my thighs are huge. i have so much fat around my tummy that i can squish it and hold it with my hands. it is so disgusting. my arms and face are also fat. i am a surfer and surfer girls are supposed to be thin and athletic. in photos of me surfing my thighs look huge and my face looks fat. i struggle with binge eating disorder. i can t stop eating. either because i am still hungry my stomach is honestly like a bottomless pit, i hate it or i will just be eating out of compulsion. i have wanted to be skinny for about a year and a half now. for the past 7 months i have been actively trying to eat less and lose weight. i am educated and know how weightloss is achieved. i just can t do it. if i was consistent with a calorie deficit i could be skinny by now. but i can barely manage to be in a calorie deficit for one day because of my bed. i have lost nothing it makes me feel like such a failure. meanwhile, my twin is deep into anorexia. we are identical so she looks like a skinny version of me. i am upset that i m the one that had to get the eating disorder that makes you a fat whale and she got the restrictive one where you end up losing weight and being skinny. this is also maybe a silly comparison but at uni she will save lots of money because she won t spend any money on food and meanwhile i will spend loads on food. my twin literally doesn t eat. and she never complains of being hungry and never as far as i know feels unwell, sick, light headed etc. when i try and restrict my food intake i get light headed within the same day, maybe because i m not used to it, and then i compulsively eat and then feel upset with myself. my twin eats fruit only. maybe a bowl of soup every other day or something. maybe some crackers or a packet of crisps. that s it. she has not had more than one meal in a day for ages. she has been consistently doing this for about 6 months now and has drastically lost weight. this makes me feel even more fat and the fact she eats nothing makes me feel super greedy in comparison i am greedy and disgusting anyway when i am always walking around the hide with food and i never seen her open the fridge or eat. she used to be double my size and now she is smaller than me and it makes me upset when she talks about clothes she has bought and casually says things to me like by the way, if you decided to get this dress too, you would need it in a size bigger than this one. when she walks around the house i find myself looking and her body and being jealous and sad. i know i shouldn t be but i am jealous that that she can easily not eat and therefore lose weight. tl;dr i have binge eating disorder and want to be skinny and my identical twin has anorexia",

"first post but i just realized something...... so i used to be anorexic for like 2 years straight right? right. anyway. last year i realized that my health was getting really bad and my body just looked weird to me so i started trying to recover. my way of recovering was to force myself to eat even if i'm not hungry bc i could easily go a full day without feeling hungry and possibly even two but obviously i needed to eat. well that really back fired on me. i gained back the weight i lost which was my goal and i was really proud of myself but now i just have another eating disorder. i just binge eat. every. single. day. like i don't ever feel hungry anymore bc i just eat so much. i get bored? i eat. i'm watching tv? i eat. not even hungry in the slightest? i eat. not doing anything with my hands? i eat. maybe some of it is bc of my adhd and always needing to be doing something but idk. it's not small amounts either like i'll eat a whole ass bag of chips in one sitting. even the family size. or i'll eat a pound of rice in one sitting. did that earlier yesterday i just now realized that i am doing that and maybe it's like a replacement to sh??? i haven't cut in several months. at least 6. idk what to do to fix this. my solution is to just become anorexic again but the ""good and healthy kind"" where you work out a lot but that's not a solution and i hate working out. plus there is no such thing as a ""good"" ed. it's all bad. i also realized that binge eating and having an addiction to eating triggers the same area in the brain as a drug addiction. always told myself i never get addicted to anything. kinda funny. got addicted to sh and food. this is bad. ig i just need advice on how to fix this bc ik once i get out of the habit of eating every hour and eating a shit ton of food at once i won't do it anymore but like i don't wanna develop another addiction in the process like chewing gum constantly. that's been an idea i've had but i feel like it'd end the same way as this has. idk. i just do everything wrong and it cause more issues. as is evident. sry if this doesn't make sense i was kinda just typing whatever came to my mind. also this was copied from a post i made in the sh subreddits bc it kinda had to do with my sh i just deleted some things and re worded some other stuff but idk. no one there could really help me. now today i only ate some nuggets when i just woke up which was almost 12 hours ago and i refuse to eat anything bc i don't believe that i'm actually hungry. i feel like it's my brain trying to trick me into eating when i don't need to ya know. bc it's so used to eating all the fucking time now. i feel like i'll be stuck in this cycle forever. going between anorexia and binge eating. i hate this...... also sorry if i used the wrong flair i'm not very smart and don't know any ed terms or acronyms yet. kinda been in denial ab having an ed for years : edit: k then. over 5 people saw this and no one decided to help me lmfao. i get ignored in every subreddit man. maybe i'm just making up the who ed thing. clearly this isn't an issue if everyone ignores it. i'm upset that i wasted so much time typing this ",

finished my first week inpatient . i finally gave up trying to recover myself after hitting 12 lbs as a 6 4 male. i was blacking out constantly and had shortened my diet to one meal every 2 days consisting of a salad and 1 cup of egg whites. i was biking 2 miles a day and had myself that was the healthy thing to be doing. my parents sent me across the country to the only hospital with an open spot that was qualified to treat me. after coming in with a 24 heart rate last week i can slowly feel myself gaining strength. it is totally miserable and terrifying but i m making so much progress. i ve conquered so many fear foods. i ate cereal and a cheeseburger for the first time in a year and couldn t be prouder of myself. i m the only guy in here and it s kinda hard to relate to all the chicks but i know i m where i m supposed to be.,

"what should i do?. since i was a teenager i always had a difficult time with my weight. when i was a teenager i started a ed which make me loose weight. i was so skinny i couldn t do anything, always tiered and depressed. long story short i get over it, start gaining weight. now i m in my twenties, my parents keep saying i m too fat. ik i am but i m healthy. my mom says that i look better when i was a teenager. she started giving me this pills, a chinese medicine that says it helps to loose weight. this medication has too many side effects. like insomnia, depression, anxiety and this makes me not to be hungry at all. now i barely have a meal a day. but now my parents are happy that i m loosing weight, and keep saying i should keep doing it. it s been almost three weeks, but they want it for at least three months. i feel my ed is starting, i hate to see food, i hate the idea of having to eat at a family reunion. what should i do?",
"ed picky eater?. hi everyone. for years now i ve 26f had difficulty eating things i m not in the mood for. i frequently skip dinners my husband makes because it s not what i want at the moment and the thought of eating it is repulsive. they re not even meals that are different from what i normally eat. i also have problems with food i take to work. for example, yesterday i made a turkey sandwich for lunch. i took one bite, realized i was not in the mood for it and had such a difficult time getting the food down. i had to force myself to chew and swallow it and it was so unsatisfying. in my head i felt like i was eating gray sludge. i couldn t even finish it because of how much i wasn t in the mood and i d rather just not eat than put it in my mouth again. now last week, i ate like 4 turkey sandwiches because i was craving them and didn t have any problems. i also have problems with textures and very flavorful meals but that s typically an issue with unfamiliar foods. does anyone else experience this? i feel bad for wasting food that s made but it s just unbearable to eat things that i m not craving right at that moment. i had a referral sent to the psychiatrist but haven t had anyone reach out. last time i spoke to them 3 weeks ago, they said the next opening was in september. i don t even know if this is an ed if i m just picky and if they can even help with it. i am overweight so i m definitely getting enough food. i m just frustrated with it all. added a trigger warning because it s my first time posting and i don t want to bother anyone ",

"becoming concerned with my husband's body image issues and it's starting to affect my own self image.. hi there. so i'm 28f just looking for some advice i guess regarding my husband 3 m and his body image issues. he suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that i am sometimes concerned and honestly i'm reaching a point where i am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. i try to be understanding and reassuring to him. he has a very abusive father who he is permanently nc with now for over a year. his father spent basically his whole childhood berating dh for his weight. he was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. they filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. my heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight just straight up bullying and the things he would do to shame him for it. when he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can't remember exactly what it was. his weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he's always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. when we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto. he's gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. i'm a little chubby myself so i don't care at all. i'm bigger than him, i feel. he, however, is distraught about it all the time. he's tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it's honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together. i've urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that's not diet friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. he stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. it worries me a lot. if i wasn't with him almost all the time, i would really worry about him skipping meals. my issue now is that i cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. it's starting to negatively affect my own self image and i'm starting to obsess too. i can't handle him saying ""i'm so fat"" and telling him ""you look fine, i like how you look"" twenty times a day. sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so i don't know what to say. he sees a therapist for other things, and i have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won't do it. he thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won't care about how he looks and he'll get fat, and i don't know how to explain to him that that's not how that works. i'm really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but i don't know how to say this to him. i'm so frustrated and sometimes i feel he can tell how tired i am of the conversation. i don't want to hurt him or make him feel like i'm not there for him, but there's nothing more i feel i can do and it's really starting to get into my head and i'm feeling bad about my own body. i don't know what to do. any advice?",

"i feel like my eating disorder isn t valid because i m not skinny. i ve had eating disorders my whole life. i remember back in middle school i used to restrict my eating by only eating frozen blueberries and binge by eating entire servings of food made for 4 people. last year was probably the worst for me because i was super depressed and also had a roomate. i m too scared to eat around people so i would starve myself for days and only come out to eat when he left. i ended up losing 5 lbs in 4 months without even trying. i lived off baby food , gummies, and pizza. my ribs and hip bones were fully visible. it was also the only time in my life where someone has called my body beautiful, and not hot or fuckable. naturally i m curvy but i don t want to be. it always just drew attention and it felt like people were making fun of me for having big hips butt. once i got my own apartment i gained some of the weight back but now i feel gross again. i ve lost about 4 pounds the past 3 weeks by restricting but i feel like i m not losing the weight fast enough. i get too hungry to completely starve and water fasts don t help. i feel a bit better about myself losing some weight but 4 pounds isn t enough to fully satisfy me. looking in reflections isn t so bad but when i look down at my body everything is so big i hate it. i don t even know what i act look like at this point because everyday it changes.",

"i need help rant. hey guys. i'm looking for some help. last october, after becoming overweight over lockdown due to mental health issues, i began trying to lose some weight. most of my motivation to lose the weight came from persistent comments from my family and such; i was happy with my body. it wasn't really something i thought about. i don't know thought. one day i just snapped. i ended up losing a good amount, and once i hit my goal weight pre lockdown weight , i wasn't happy; i had to keep going. i've stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven't really gone past a safe deficit. i've only restricted 5 1 calories each day, mostly just a 5 cal deficit. however, i know my mindset isn't a healthy one. i'm obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. my weight loss hasn't been drastic, and im still in a 'healthy' bmi now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. this whole makes me feel awful because since like last october i've only lost about 2 pounds. i started at like 135 lbs at 5'1"" and am now about 115. it's taken me literally so long to get this far but its felt gut wrenchingly long. i feel like i shouldve done better anyways in the past few months, i've started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. today was my second visit, first was three months ago and my doctor expressed concern with it, even though it was only like 6lbs in 3 months , saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she'll consider referring me to a nutritionist. this means that my weight loss is no longer something i can hide behind, which terrifies me. i'm not happy with my body yet, but i have no other choice but to try and recover. i don't want to but there's not really another choice. i'm worried if i'm referred to a nutritionist i'll be forced to stop being vegan my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons , or something so i would really love to avoid having to go to one. i'm so worried and i don't want to stop losing but i need to recover. do any of you guys have advice for self recovery and getting out of the ""not sick enough"" mindset and pursuing recovery? how do i get my ""goal weight"" out of my mind and try to get over this i can't stand the idea that i won't be really able to lose any more weight, and if i do it'll have to be at a much slower rate. i can't stand the idea that i won't get to my goal weight. it's only 1 lbs away, but it feels like the end of the world that i won't be able to make it there, i don't really know what this post is anymore. kind of a rant of desperation kind of a ""how do i deal with this"" type post. my eating habits have been like this for almost a whole year i can't fathom the idea of going back to maintenance cals. please help me. i'm so worried. i would do anything not to gain a single pound back. even if i can't hit 1 5 i cant imagine not being able to lose anymore. my head is spinning and this is driving me nuts. i have to keep losing weight but i can't hide it anymore so i dont know what to do",

"feeling very out of control rant, tw . i quite purging for a few around a few months ago and switched over to restricting and unfortunately i've been relapsing throughout this month and it's so much worse that it was before, i purged at a friend's house last week new low and been purging over 3 times a day. i'm cold all the time and dizzy a good amount of the day. i don't even binge i just can't keep down anything, if i feel full at all i freak out. i also moved recently and my roommates cat died the second day there we've known each other for years so i know how much her cat meant to her and i also loved the kitty and she hasn't been staying at the apartment for a bit so i've been alone, with all the food, i'm debating getting a childlock on the cabinet fridge so i can just stop eating. i told myself when i got home from work to not eat anything at all, and guess who immediately ate things? this bitch. oh yeah i plugged my toilet which was yet another atrocity commiting upon myself",
"do i have an eating disorder? if so, what kind of disorder do i have?. starting off, for a while i have felt like something is off with my relationship with food. i know something is wrong, i just don't have a label to describe it. i want some sort of label so i can at least have a word to describe what i am going through. currently, i am unable to get a professional dx, yet i'm starting to see a counselor for the first time september. i'm not sure if i'll feel comfortable telling them right away, or at all. and if i do, i would like some word or at least an idea of what to say when i bring it up. that is why i'm turning to asking reddit. when i was a young kid, i did not like eating at all. my parents were always having to force feed me themselves, because i would never willingly eat a full plate on my own. i would do thing such as hide my food in a napkin, bribe my siblings to eat it for me, hold it in my cheeks and spit it out in the toilet, or hide my food in the trash. and if i did eat anything, it would take me at least an hour to finish a plate. my doctor was concerned about me being underweight too. ive felt negative about eating for a while now too. the process of digestion grosses me out, and the idea of chewing, swallowing, and having your food come out of you has always made me uncomfortable. but i would eat food if i had to, because in my culture, where i'm from, refusing food when it's offered to you can be seen as offensive and rude. then, during january i went through a depressive episode. i stayed in my bed, and didn't shower, change my clothes, or even my bedsheets after my dog had peed on them. it was gross. during that time, i barely ate at all. the most i would eat per day is 5 spoons of food if i could handle it. i lost a lot of weight, weighing between 7 8 pounds at the time. then, when i got out of that state, i started eating a lot. i'd eat a lot of food in one sitting til where i felt uncomfortable. i felt gross the whole time while eating, but i wasn't able to stop myself. then, i'd try to make up for it by not eating at all for at least 24 hrs, or by making myself throw up. but my gag reflex is practically nonexistent, and it took a lot to make myself throw up to where my throat would be really sore after so l don't like doing it that much. it feels like an endless cycle of me eating, then my stomach hurts and i feel bad because i ate, and then i don't eat, and then my stomach hurts because i didn't eat and i can't stop myself from eating again. and i hate it because i wish i didn't even have to eat food in the first place. i don't know what kind of eating disorder any of this translates into, but if anyone does, please let me know",

"can it be anorexia if i don t count calories?. i m 22f and my doctor recently told me to look into an ed treatment center, but did not actually give me any diagnosis or referral. i m currently at the lowest bmi i ve ever been 17 , but i feel like many of the things i do don t match up to the typical presentation. the weight loss was mostly intentional, but i have never actually counted my calories; instead i just can tell from how full i feel, or how empty nauseous. i also do not restrict any types of foods i eat junk food and sugar if i feel like it. mostly, my weight loss comes from fasting and decreased appetite from nicotine and stomach shrinking. however, i have managed to maintain an underweight bmi ever since the pandemic began. my doctor asked me how i d feel about gaining up the bare minimum for my height and i flatly refused. does this sound like anorexia?",

"how do i help a person who are not willing to change their current routine. someone i hold very close to my heart has been dealing with their weight for about 2 years i think? it started really badly with them trying to reduce their weight by going about their day not eating anything, not even water. it progressed to drinking only water amd now its gotten better and their eating one meal a day. they have lost 15 2 kgs during this period. if they lose 5 7 more kgs, they're gonna be underweight. i'm worried sick and i don't know how to try and get them to a healthier lifestyle. i love them soso much. they're still trying to lower their weight and get super anxious with even 3 kg increase in their weight and go to extreme lengths to reduce the weight. i've tried numerous times and i thought they were getting better but recently, i have realised that since they think what they're doing is working and don't show any side effects rn, it's fine to keep doing it. i've tried suggesting to eat 3 meals a day; just tiny things 3 times a day. i thought i could slowly ease them to 3 meals a day but they're very very stubborn and even warned me that they don't want any fallout between us so it's better i don't interfere. i don't care for a fallout as long as they're happier and healthier. i largely try to convince them over text. ik it's not the most efficient but i'm not exactly great at speaking irl nor can i be efficient enough to convince anybody. how do i go about this? what should i do?",
"my triggers make me feel selfish, need advice. first of all i've been struggling with eating disorders since i was in middle school. i have never been diagnosed because i avoid the subject with doctors therapists and it scares me to tell someone. two years ago when i was 14 i reached my lowest weight but managed to recover partially over time with the help of my antidepressants. i relapsed recently, in april 2 22. my triggers are mostly things like comments about my weight or appearance, or comments about my eating habits. however, i also get triggered a lot by other people's eating habits. i have a great sense of observation and i get scared and jealous when people eat less than me. i know it is immature and petty but i am trying to overcome it, which leads me to the important point of this post: i have noticed that my friend has developped and eating disorded a short time after my relapse. i wont get into details but i am certain she has one, more precisely anorexia i am usually always there for my friends and i always want to help them when i notice something is wrong. usually i would have asked her what is going on in case she wants to talk about it, but i can't bring myself to do it because if she admits to having an ed it will: 1 make me wanna help her but how can i help if i have the same problem? 2 if i do help her i would have to recover too and i dont want to 3 if she admits to having an ed i know i will see it as competiton and mine will get worse 4 she may be triggered by me bringing up the subject so im in this mindset where if i do nothing i'm a bad selfish friend, and if i do someting i'm hypocritical not following my own advices and also a bad friend by maybe triggering her . idk what to do i feel even more selfish because i want her to recover not only for her wellbeing, but also because if she eats normally then i can stop comparing myself to her. i feel like a really bad person. please give me some advices or just what you think about the situation. thank you for reading until the end",

"any advice? lingering muscle pain. hello i am 24 m and looking for some advice because i really don t know where else to go. i recently went through an eating disorder and lost 1 lbs in 8 months by under eating 12 calories and exercising excessively 6 days a week for 2 hours. the excersizes started off as only cardio but then i transitioned to mainly weight lifting. i eventually had a mental breakdown and went to the doctor because i was starting to have anxiety panic attacks, depression and extreme muscle pain. i then did blood work and i was severely deficient in testosterone 98 and vitamin d. i was referred to a urologist and endocrinologist whom came to the conclusion that i had put my body into starvation mode and my reproductive system shut down to preserve energy for my vital organs. that caused me to stop producing testosterone. which low t can cause depression, anxiety and loss of muscle mass. i have not worked out or dieted since my breakdown which was three months ago. i have gotten treated for the testosterone deficiency with testosterone pellets and am now over the normal range and am also now in the normal range for vitamin d. i am on antidepressants and my mental health has improved a tad bit and i have intentionally gained about fifteen pounds. the problem is that after resolving many of my issues i am still having severe muscle pain deep burning sensation in my triceps, buttocks, calves and sides of my neck which coincidentally are the muscle groups i trained .i have tried several nsaids, extra strength tylenol, and my pcp even started me on cymbalta because she said that this could help the depression and can treat fibromyalgia which causes muscle aches. none of these medications have provided me with relief. and i don t think i developed fibromyalgia over night because before the weight loss i rarely had muscle pain. i have had inflammation, ck and magnesium labs that have all came back in range so i don t think it s anything autoimmune related. i thought once i got my testosterone back in range or gained weight that the pain would ease up. i left my job after the mental breakdown and have been resting for weeks and that hasn t even helped the pain. it seems like it worsens flares up when i am stressed out or get upset. the pain gets so bad that i can t even think straight sometimes and the only thing that semi helps is when i massage the areas. please if anyone has gone through something similar and or has any advice i would greatly appreciate it. i don t want to live like this forever.",
"idk if i have an issue i j need to rant. big tw background: i've kinda always had issues with my body? i mean im sure everyone does but i was a pretty chubby kid and as i went into ms hs i kinda lost the weight and now im actually underweight to the point where my doctors are making me gain but i didn't lose out of my deliberate efforts or anything idek i don't think i have an eating disorder but i dont think i have the best relationship with food. like i definitely have periods where im calorie counting, i occasionally make myself not eat a lot for meals and i try not to snack much obv i fail but it's just. so tiring sometimes. but usually i eat enough. and sometimes i just hate myself so much over it. just like stop eating. stop. i went to a friends house and we made smores and i had four and a half. and my friend something like ""yeah usually people only eat one"". and i can't stop thinking about it. do people think i eat too much? are people watching me and thinking about how much im eating? why can't i just fucking stop eating so much . and my parents always say something every time i eat smt with sugar. i put jam in some yogurt i was eating, someone had smt to say. and it sucks yk? it's so hard living in a society where everything is j skinnyskinnyskinny. it's so hard hating my body for so long and actually getting to a point where i like my body only for my doctor to force me to gain ten pounds. it sucks feeling like my body is being taken away from me, i don't want to gain weight, part of me doesn't care that i've never properly had a period because i'm underweight. but the other part of me is justifying every single little thing i want to eat with ""it's fine, you have to gain weight anyways "" and then i realized that i'm not actually indulging because i want to gain weight, it's just the same little voice that kept me eating and eating and eating before this whole being forced to gain weight thing. i had a friend basically tell me ""you don't look that underweight you look fine"" and i wanted to scream. because if im not even skinny now i'm going to hate what i look like after this. why can't you just see? why can't you see that i can be skinny and be so scared of gaining weight? why can't you see that it's more about it being good for me and shit, it's about dismantling this entire view i have towards food. im here looking at the scale with dread if i go up or go down. why can't i just have some self fucking control. why can't i just be at a healthy weight and be skinny at the same time. i hate walking through hallways and looking at everyone's perfect fucking bodies and hating mine and my stupid ugly face.",
"my brother thinks i have an ed, now i m worried.. i should start this off by saying i know asking people on the internet isn t the best, but i m worried about bringing it up to my mom since she says i fake stuff a lot and i m currently not in therapy. truth be told, i don t know why i m asking, maybe morbid curiosity? i don t know, but i ll get to the point. i don t know how to start this off any way other than i hate eating. not only am i a picky eater, to the point where i cannot eat unless i m presented with food i want, but even when i am, the idea of having to eat is repulsive. but, here s the thing: it s not about weight for the most part unless it s junk food, but that s mostly because i play a sport. , i don t know why it s repulsive, but it is. i usually don t eat until i can barely walk, and when i do eat, i try to eat as little as possible. i told my brother about it because we went to a restaurant and he got me fries one of my favorite foods and i refused to touch it. he thinks i have an ed, and while i don t think i do, now i m not sure. any advice?",
"i'm past my anorexia but i really can't forget that. i was still very anorexic, but as well i've never been skinny normally i wasnt extremely underweight, just a lil bit literally , after a month of recovery i finally got out the hospital,. a month after i had to return for non related things , but i was in pediatric place, where also people with anorexia were, it was going normal, till a weird woman she is weird on general, even doctors say that mother of a daughter with anorexia wanted to talk, she me my mother her daughter another person with anorexia mum and her daughter came, i'm not very social so i just stood there , till ofc the subject of anorexia came out, her daughter was clearly just skinny by nature, was way skinnier than me, and she watching me up to down straight up said "" i wish my daughter was your size "" , all i did was walk back into my room, i got she can be desperate or anything, but i was anorexic too, i was upset , luckily i didn't take it too bad so after a year i recovered but, that was so insensitive, like really, you're really gonna say that to someone struggling? to make them feel even worse? anyway the daughter of the other mum came into my room and comforted me, i mean, she just said just not to worry about it, what could she say?",
"ready to admit it?. i ve always told myself that i focus really hard on school, that has been my most used means of deflection. right now i am not in school for the first time in a very long time, i m actually starting to date again, and i m enjoying life more and more. the issue is that the more i come out of my self made shell, the more i realize that my body and my mind aren t lining up. when i meet people it is not uncommon for someone to make a comment on how thin i am, which feels so uncomfortable to hear. if the same comments keep being made it must be true, but not even at my lowest weight have i thought that i was skinny. in high school i was put in inpatient for an eating disorder, and it never clicked to me how they found out about it despite the fact that i was clearly emaciated. i moved far away from my family this year and my roommates have consistently asked me for weight loss tips, as my weight has apparently dropped drastically. i abuse laxatives, fast regularly, and eat one time per day but i can t stress enough how much it does not feel like i have a problem. i feel sicker and weaker when i am forced to eat unruly amounts of food. without others telling me, i would have no idea that i am getting worse . how and why does my brain lie to me? is this a theme with all anorexics? it s crazy to me that my body looks a certain way and i will never be able to see it objectively the way others do. i feel like i am at the whim of my brains ability to starve, and i m worried that it might get worse in the next few months. how long can my body put up with this?",

"body checking on social media a series of questions. i have a history with anorexia, and am mostly in the clear now. having established myself quite firmly in the field of psychology now with a special interest in eating disorders, i'm really keen to do some of my.own research on the less discussed, nitty gritty things that can so often come with eating disorders. so i have a big list of questions that may be triggering to some. they discuss in depth discussion of body checking to check ones own body either in the mirror, reflective surfaces, looking down at ones self, taking photos specifically on social media and therefore knowingly public open to others judgement. please try not to read any further if discussions about this topic will be hard for you, i am just genuinely really interested in knowing more about what people think, especially with lived experience, as i see many people online famous and not famous get criticism for posting body checking photos and i find myself wondering if these people even realise what they're doing, whether they have any responsibility here, or if this is a pandora's box of an issue. as an example: someone posts a photo of themselves on social media and they are very obviously doing a 'body checking' pose popping the collar bones, shoulders forward, leaning over, weird contorted pose to flex the thighs, etc etc 1. is that individual to blame for sharing that on social media and potentially influencing others? 2. should these people be reported or berated in any way? 3. are comments about the posing weight loss emphasis good or bad? does your answer change if that person has never looked this thin posted such a photo before? 4. if someone does not has not ever shared that they have an eating disorder, are expressions of concern good or bad? 5. do comments like 'dont tell someone what they should be doing with their body' apply when the person of interest definitely is or might possibly be damaging themselves? does your answer change for definitely has a confirmed eating disorder, or not known not confirmed or diagnosed? 6. if someone has shared that they have had or do have an eating disorder, does that make a body check photo worse? is it open to a different judgement? 7. if you have experience of body checking on social media or in real life only the kind that is public such as wearing deliberately oversized clothes not much clothing sitting and posing in front of others in ways to make oneself appear smaller, etc , what do you make of established 'ed accounts' posting these photos, compared to people who post similar photos without a confirmed diagnosis let's assume these people might be in their initial decline into an eating disorder and might not realise yet, or have realised and are in denial ? 8. finally, what should we, as a society made up of both people with and without experience of an eating disorder, do to address this? this is an open question, i want to know what everyone feels and thinks about this and whether anything can or should be done. thanks so much if you get to the bottom of this, and don't worry if your answers are long. the more the merrier ",

"if i disappear, do you see me then?. i hope it is okay to post this on here.. ""but you do not look sick?"" well, you do not look like an idiot, but here we are kidding, heheh .. eating disorders are mental disorders, not cultural phenomena .. and unfortunately, i sincerely believe that, when most people hear the word eating disorder , images appear in the head of skinny and tired bodies .. and it is so sad, because it is so much more, there is so much more behind .. there are different types of eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, arphide, overeating disorder etc .. and no, you can not always see that you are sick .. it's not easy to see that i struggle with food .. i am ""normal weight"" whatever that means , and i have never been particularly thin .. i eat in expected situations, and i like to talk about how good the food is .. but; food is my weakness .. a love hate relationship .. i hate food. and i love food. .. i want to feel in control, which is the opposite of what i feel now .. but there is so much food does for me .. comfort, reward or punishment , distraction, anxiety suppressant and the intense emptiness inside me is filled , ""intoxication"", joy, pastime, if only for a little while .. ""it is good to see that you have such a good appetite"" .. well, food is not always pleasurable, but more like a compulsion .. a prison .. but because i might look a little bigger yes, quite true, but i'm built that way, and it's totally okay , no one suspects i'm struggling with food .. besides, i think as little as possible about myself myself, hoping to take up a little less space, and i think it works, because i am not seen .. i am so ""big"" that i am invisible .. often i think that, maybe if i had been as small as i feel me, then it would be easier, but no .. no matter how much i want help, our dear mental health care sees eating disorders as something physical .. all that is grilled in the head is weight and bmi .. ""you are not sick enough"", and hey we were back to not looks sick .. no, i do not look sick, but i will promise you that this disorder will soon suffocate me to death, it just does not seem .. the mental health care, system and all that; you have a long way to go .. sharpen up ",

how do i get it out of my room without anyone knowing?. so basically i have really rotten old salad lunch in a lunchbox in my room. i go on a trip in 2 days including today and i ll be gone for a week. currently a candle is all that keeps my room from stinking and i m really worried it will stink up the whole house while i m gone. in order to take the trash out you have to take it downstairs which usually my mom or sister does as well as cleaning our cats litter boxes so it would be suspicious if i offered to do it suddenly. how do i get it out of my room without anyone knowing? edit: if i ve still got reddit and my phone when i get back on wednesday i ll give an update update: surprisingly didn t smell at all. my lunchbox is insulated so it keeps the smell pretty hidden. kind of scared to see what the inside of the lunchbox looks like,

"need help. hi everyone the paragraphs below tell my story while asking for advice surrounding my battle with bulimia nervosa. i apologize for the length, i just really need help. 1. i have been struggling with a bulimia nervosa for about 2 years now. i used to restrict and binge at nights always purging after about once a week. for the past year i have no control and usually do it 4 5 nights a week. i am a 24 year old athletic male who played d1 sports in college. i checked myself into a rehab center for substance abuse issues alcohol and cocaine last june and that s when my ed got really bad as i was binging and purging secretly in rehab the entire time 2 3 times day. i spent a few months not drinking after rehab where i continued to struggle. i am obsessed with working out and have severe body image issues. i legitimately feel like everytime i eat, my face and body looks feels really fat so i restrict. i am 6 4 and usually weigh 21 pounds. right now, i am 185 pounds last time i weighed below 19 i was 15 years old i run every morning before work and lift after. but it doesn t matter, because i waste all my nutrition when i purge every night. i am seeking advice for how people deal with the weigh gain mentally when stopping a binge purge cycle and any best practices? 2. what medication works for people? i have taken adhd medication since 8th grade and my psychiatrist prescribed me 14 mg of vyvanse a day a lot i know . i have always taken a high dosage of adderall but was advised to switch to vyvanse. vyvanse makes me extremely irritable it suppresses my appetite during the day but as soon as it wears off at night usually around 1 pm right before bed i end up doordashing 5 of food, sneaking it by roommates and binging purging. i started taking zoloft 5 months ago as i have severe anxiety. i honestly feel like the zoloft has made it worse. i took lexapro a few years ago and remember it having a much better impact on my anxiety. has anyone had any success with lexapro or any other adhd medication? 3. i m noticing aggressive tooth decay and hair loss to the point where friends and family have noticed. i am seeking advice for what products or vitamins i can take to slow down my hair loss and tooth decay? any recommended supplements? 4. i know the other way to stop my hair loss, tooth decay, and other various symptoms is to stop this vicious cycle. my friends and family knew i had this issue last year, but they thought it was under control now. i told them about a month ago how bad it s gotten and i legitimately need help or this is going to kill me. i know the with the longevity of my disorder and the symptoms i m experiencing that i should check myself into inpatient treatment. i simply cannot do that right now due to high demanding job. i understand that is an ignorant mindset. i m set to see an ed specialist finally who specializes in diet and medication management. i was wondering if anyone has had success with outpatient programs sheppard pratt etc. ? 5. sorry for the long post but would love any advice on the following topics listed above weight gain medication for managing appetite anxiety nutrients vitamins for tooth decay and hair loss and most importantly if outpatient treatment programs have been impactful. any advice would be very impactful and much appreciated. thank you very much and please stay safe.

"what is considered a binge?. generally, what do you consider a binge? what is the difference between eating a normal amount of calories and binging? tw numbers mentioned below so theoretically, say i ve been at 5 6 cal a day don t come at me i m in the admissions process for res and i usually break that up into separate 15 2 calorie meals . but tonight, i had an additional 3 calories at once, which is way more than i have at one time. it also was a super high volume of food you can eat a t o n of baby food and fruit for just a few hundred calories . obviously it s really stupid to ask if 3 calories counts as a binge but to me it 1 feels like i binged, i had a super high volume of food, more calories than i typically eat at once, in addition to the food i normally eat in a day, late at night, and i m full now. i feel like that absolutely constitutes as a binge. but i also did it because i woke up hungry in the middle of the night, not just to eat. i ve never really binged before, idk if this is something i need to bring up to therapist dietician or if my thinking is just especially disordered right now.",

"don't know what to make of my actions. tw: mentioning unhealthy habits and relationship with food weight truthfully, i am pretty conventionally skinny although i think i could be a lot more healthy. i know healthy and skinny are not equivalent. i need to eat better, work out more. but i want to lose a bit more weight just to lose the belly pouch, arm flab, muffin top just the minor things. so i go on these stints of not eating for as long as i possibly can and of course i always end up failing and eating out one night, after which i feel so incredibly ashamed, angry and guilty the day after. during this past summer i managed to lose a bunch of weight and received so many comments about it. my parents were concerned but obviously parents are just overbearing. honestly i loved all the comments from others about how nice i look. i was so proud of myself but i'm mad that i don't have the discipline to starve more or even be able to do it again to the same degree as last year. i lie to people that i workout more than i do and eat healthy but really i'm just starving myself. as a medical student, i find it convenient too because then i don't have to take food breaks during my day. i feel so annoyed that i can't go back to my consistency from last summer that i've even started thinking about making myself throw up. but i haven't yet and don't really want to go to that point, but every time i end up eating i get more tempted to think about it. i want to talk to someone about this but i'm too embarrassed or afraid of what they may think. i feel so awful feeling like this because i know it's so bad but i can't help but want it. do i have an ed? how do i stop?",

"eating disorder treatment and treatment fatigue?. tw:ed treatment weight gain weight loss b.e a.n i have been struggling with an ed for over four years now, i had hidden it really well for a while i guess, but my mom had suspected about two years back. she hadn't done anything about it at the time and then back in october signed me up for a php program that ended up not being about eds but about mental health. which i have also been severely struggling with they ended up doing nothing, just letting me sleep the entire time, and not doing anything for my mental health. we had an intake with the emily program in which they ended up telling me i was in critical condition and had to move to residential treatment. they never told us when but there was quite a waiting list. my intake was probably in november. my brother ended up coming home from the military sometime in december. for some quick background, he and i were super close at the time. i had just gotten over covid so they weren't requiring me to get tested before i went in because it was within 9 days. i was also just getting into a very new relationship in december. i was at my now boyfriend's house when i got multiple calls from my mom. i had called her back and that's when she told me that i had less than three days before i had to leave. you can imagine my surprise, especially because they told me they would give me a week's notice. he and i spent every moment from that call to the day i left together. extending our curfews and did everything we could to get just a little bit more time. i had left for residential on the 28th of december in 2 21. they told me 3 days. then later i find out that my discharge ended up being on the 26th of march... i also have something called ""oral allergy syndrome"" pretty much means i will react to certain fruits and vegetables but only sometimes based on when they were pollinated. my first problem being there was, that anytime i would react to a food, i would get a response from someone saying, ""challenge it. it's just your eating disorder."" which is absolutely absurd, it was in my chart, and it was very evident that i was having an allergic reaction. my mother had to call in repeatedly to tell them to which they'd say ""well she needs to get diagnosed."" i have been diagnosed for years. my second problem came from my dietitian. she had given me my goal weight, and though i have an eating disorder, with a jaded sense of normal when it comes to weight, it seemed abnormally high. i had expressed my concerns to my mom once again to which she was shocked. because my dietitian told her a completely different number. i was livid. my dietitian informed me about how they decide the goal weight. they look at growth charts and fine your ""natural arch"" from before the eating disorder had started. she had told me that my goal weight was in the 8 th percentile, but the weight she told my mom was in the 6 th. my mom is also in the medical field. and then sent me my growth charts. i had struggled with eating before i was struggling with anorexia. i had a step dad with binge eating. we kept tons of junk food in the house, and i was gaining too much weight while i was in early middle school. i was developing an addiction to sugar... to which the same dietitian told me ""you can't be addicted to sugar."" but that dietitian refused to believe that my eating habits back then were unhealthy. i have had countless doctors try to put me on diets because of my rapid weight gain back then. so my ""natural body arch"" was inaccurate. before all my unhealthy eating habits, i was naturally in the 5 th percentile for weight. but that's where i was when i went into the hospital because i gained weight before i left knowing it would help me get out faster. understandably so, she didn't want me leaving the same weight i went in. but she refused to accept the fact that it was where i was supposed to be. so she forced me to gain too much weight. i am also pretty short because i started restricting at the same time i was supposed to be growing. so i am at a whopping five foot one inch. they ended up discharging me a month early because my mom and i ended up calling the insurance company to explain what the dietitian was telling us. the ed specialist at our insurance was on our side and agreed to stop insurance coverage so i could get out. my mental health was going to hell, while in res. i was mentally worse in there than i was before going in. but they told me ""your physical health needs to be fixed before you focus on your mental health"" it was driving me crazy. i simply just wasn't allowed to be depressed there. so i got out and was signed up for idp. which i started a couple of days after leaving residential. which then, was 35 hours a week. from 12 7 mon fri. that was even more mentally draining than residential. it prevented me from going to school, going to work and getting money... i may be 17 but i have bills i need to pay. my parents don't pay for everything , and having relationships with friends and my boyfriend. i had countless panic attacks from being there. that was about two months and i had my step down a couple of days ago to iop. iop is now 4 7 mon thurs. a lot less. but i am so tired of treatment. i've been in these treatments since october. i am a junior in high school and it is seriously starting to affect my grades. i had to drop all my classes except two. the entire time i was in res, i did no school. and now i am at risk of not graduating. so, this current treatment i am in has a mandatory community meeting on tuesdays. in which, my parents are supposed to join from 5 7. mine can't. first of all, my bio parents are divorced and i am not close with my stepfather or stepmother at all. my mom works during that time from home, and my stepdad is asleep due to his work hours as well. because of that, they asked if i had any older siblings available to fill in. one is in the military, one is a state away along with my bio father and stepmom , and the last is due in a couple of weeks to deliver her baby. so no. i don't have anyone to ""fill in"" for my parents. at that point, they told my mom ""we might have to discharge her if there is nobody that can support her."" but at the same time, they keep telling my mom how important iop is for my recovery. as i was sitting in the meeting last night they had asked me if my boyfriend could fill in. and be in the meetings that my parents are supposed to be in. oh my god. i love him, so much. and he has been extremely supportive and understanding of my recovery. but i don't feel comfortable relying on him once again for this. and my parents agree. my biggest problem with these treatments is that i feel like it isn't helping my eating disorder. now i'm not saying it hasn't i feel like it's just making me so depressed, unmotivated, and mentally drained that i don't have the energy to keep trying to have an eating disorder. this is all absolutely crazy. it's driving me crazy too. so here i am. asking for advice?",

"i can t stop eating. how do i stop eating all this food?. ever since friday, april 15th, i ve been non stop eating. i can t stop eating and i m wayyyy over my calorie maintenance. on friday i had a large baked sweet potato, 1 one large cod fillet coated and pan fried with a bowl 5 g of mixed vegetables. then i had 1 pieces of cod deep fried in vegetable oil, and then 3 triangle cinnamon raisin rolls. saturday i had a butter container full of swiss chalet soup. then sunday i had 3 whole red potatoes, 8 slices of rugabata, 7 carrots, and half a cabbage. today has been the worst day as i have ate a bowl of mixed vegetables 5 g , mixed berries 3 g , lots of dark turkey meat, 196g of munchies chips, one pack of hersheys mini eggs, a reese s egg, two quaker dipps rainbow chip bars, a banana, cookies and cr me egg, two lindor chocolates, 6 pirogies, 2 costco apple braided turn over, swiss chalet fries with turkey gravy and a hersheys whole almond bar. this is where i have not yet kept going but i feel like i will and i can t stop. i don t know what to do. i m guessing my body is just craving whatever food is available as i ve been restricting for a while. it just hurts my stomach and sucks that i m not eating my regular daily foods of no processed foods only whole. this is really mentally hard on myself. i was wondering what do j do here? just let myself eat and eat? is this beneficial at all for recovery? these are not whole foods these are processed and i don t want to gain fat and bad weight.",

"starting to recover, ed voice still won't shut up. i'm trying to recover and i'm doing somewhat ok, most of the time i'm ok with eating although i definitely still don't eat as much as i should but its better than it was. but the eating disorder voice is still there and my dumb ass of course went and learned how many calories are in all of the things i normally eat so here i am now having eaten mostly ok today and my ed voice is just like ""hey it looks luek you've eaten way too many calories today. you should really calculate how many that was"". and now i've just counted them up and i feel like shit and the ed voice is telling me i really need to throw up now and i'm feeling really guilty and trying to ignore it wow this is fun.",

"holiday meals are hard. the single worst part about holidays is the meal. people you care about put a lot of time and effort into making food that is high carb, high fat, high sodium, and just plain bad for your diet... and you're encouraged to eat more than normal, because it's a holiday then there's leftovers. ""we have so much, take some home with you."" it's like one day of bad eating isn't enough, you're supposed to keep at it. on the way home i legit pulled over at a gas station and threw away the leftovers i was given into the garbage. it's nothing but lettuce, lemon water and hard boiled eggs for the next 3 days to undo all this damage. fuck you, holiday meals.",
"what do you do when you regret or are pressured to eat something but then you find that you can't stop? long rant . you know when you eat too much food that you didn't really want and it just weighs on your mind at the end of the day? i'd like to share an experience. okay story time. i went out to a restaurant this afternoon, i came for a spicy wings challenge but decided i wanted a little bit of mac n cheese too, the mac n cheese ended up being too many calories total, which was fine because i only wanted to have a little bit and shared the rest with my parents while trying some of what they ordered with it. i had some of the mac n cheese but it was not what i hoped it would be, and my parents ordered some bland fried food basically nuggets and dip , which i tried a little but didn't really want to eat. now we are waiting for the challenge, 75 of my mac n cheese is sitting there bothering me while my parents slowly eat their 12 cal meals. the challenge comes along, it's not even that challenging or spicy, and i finish in almost half the time, because i wanted to leave time to clean off the bones. i'm about to go back and the judge decides that the challenge is complete. even the wings 7 cal are not really worth the calories to me, i tell myself ""one more bite's a binge"", but when my dad decided to try the spice, i end up nibbling at the bones too. then i do it again, and again. after the spicy wings there was an ice cream that came along with the wings. i didn't want the ice cream, i tried to share it with my parents but they wanted me to enjoy it. i should have passed on it altogether, but i was interested in the syrup on top. however, i didn't really like the ice cream and after a few spoonfuls i decided i was satisfied, and my parents took the rest to share while i enjoyed my zero cal drink. but then when my dad gave the ice cream to my mom, he decided that i should have her non zero cal drink. sugary drinks, boba tea for example, are a serious trigger for me i'm trying to drink slowly, freaking out that there's no way for me to avoid finishing this thing, meanwhile i'm trying to make the most of it by awkwarly switching between my zero cal drink. i tell dad to try it too, now it's getting passed around like a fucking hot potato. eventually, we decide to just leave it, and i'm sipping my drink while waiting for mom and dad to finish their food, i take a bit, unsure whether i wanted to or if it was just to be social. i then for some reason took another piece of the one with fewer pieces more cals a piece . i wiped my face with a napkin in order to discretely spit it out, but i find myself taking yet another piece. now i'm making small grabs here and there for a spoonful of the mac n cheese, a spoonful of the ice cream, and just switching between everything except the leftover of the wings which is covered in napkins and out of my reach. they got it boxed, i realize i didn't really have to eat any of it. i had brought some snacks in my pocket, i end up having a piece, then decide to chew gum while we're in the car as a coping mechanism. i had recently tried to stop coping using gum. we go shopping, i get away from my family to use the restroom. i try and i almost purge. as a little bit comes up i realize that it's only probably 1 calories or so, maybe 2k at most. i convince myself at the last second it's not worth it, but now i know how. we stop at the neighbors house to tell them about the challenge. their mom offers us some apple pie, one slice for me one slice for my parents to share. i say that it's too much for me and she puts half of the slice back. it still feels like too much. i tilt my plate, pretend to finish sweep the crumbs up with my fork, as i get up to discretely throw the remaining pie in the garbage. conversation goes on, they offer us some of a chicken dish. i take as little rice as possible because i wanted to try it, and two pieces of chicken. i didn't want to eat another meal, but i wanted to try a little bit and it would have been awkward not to. my hands get messy while eating the food, i grab a napkin and wipe off the sauce to try ans save calories. but i end up grabbing another piece. there is drink in my pocket, i added the drink mix to my water because i thought it would go well.it did, but by the time i'm done with the chicken, i still have more drink left, i end up taking one more piece of chicken. i end up adding more even more water to the cup so i could sip while we chatted, but i knew that i should have just probably poured it out. i feel distant from the conversation while i sip my drink. we all get away from the table to talk outside, but i am super tired, and go back into my house. i should have probably tried to catch a nap but i also had to fold the laundry. but i'm so worried about stopping the binge that i just start chugging salt water, not to purge, i guess to feel full to cope in order to hold off further overeating. this has backfired on me before and it just did again i don't need satiety. i just need some hope. i am now too bloated to sleep i'll have to use the bathroom and feeling too sluggish to do laundry and it is too close to dinner time to sleep. the one good thing was that there was leftover from the large salad i had before going out to prepare me for the spicy wings , and i would be able to have that for dinner. but the neighbors gave us some of the apple pie, a different chicken and potato dish, and some bread. i end up wandering to the fridge, stressing about time passing. i know that dinner is going to roll around and i am going to have fomo. i mindlessly grab some low calorie things out of the fridge, mushrooms and such. and then, as one thing lures me to the next, the spoon comes out, and i start taking bits of the fruit that was for dessert, some salsa, more mushrooms, basically everything in sight that seems low cal enough that i might as well. but that doesn't change the feeling of the calories creeping up. i spit some things out, only to mindlessly reach for even more food, i eventually go to start the dryer, still munching on asparagus, i go to throw it in the trash, still snapping off pieces and eating it as i open the lid. i run up to my room to fold the laundry that is laying out while the dryer does the second half of it. still fighting the urge to back down, i grab 2 altoids. this is usually my go to for stopping a binge, and for the first time ever, i end up reaching for a second pair of altoids. i was probably on pace to finish folding the clothes once the dryer finished, but at that point, i just layed face down and started crying. for about 2 minutes. now dinner time has come around. i used to ask to serve myself at dinner, as a way of trying to get all the low calorie food on my plate, but as my appetite has gone down, this has just become a burden. i don't really want to say too much about dinner. i get fomo as usual, they end up making me feel guilty and selfish for the time it takes me to serve myself, because i am fumbling through the cluttered kitchen that i tried to not worry about while they sit already served. i am selfish because i am desperate. anyways, i have my salad, one bread and a little bit of the chicken potato dish. i end up getting up to grab a few more vegetables from the fridge, but when dessert comes around i have the fruit that was for dessert and pass on the pie. dad insists on each of us having a slice of the cake we had from earlier in the weekend, and i end the day by swiftly putting it in my pocket and being done after finishing the fruit. i have started my fasting window about an hour ago as i finish writing this, i still have to fold the laundry, and i'm super tired. i often look at these kind of days and wonder if it's my disordered tendencies or if it's really just me. i miss when i saw no distinction felt no need for one. to think that 1 day ago i was close to my lw and physically feeling good without even trying to hard. for me, after comfortably restricting for a good while, this is just one more reminder to never let myself want something. tldr: did a spicy wing challenge, wanted a little mac n cheese for old time sake, got pressured to eat more calories than i wanted to throughout the day. the situation combined with me bingeing on my own terms led to me crying before dinner, then still having a bunch of laundry to fold before bed this post may look kind of messy and scattered since the app messed up a few times while i was writing. anyways, let me know if you have any similar experiences or ways you handle this kind of situation.",

"deathbed regrets. have i just been ""waiting around"" for my eating disorder to change? being locked in the upstairs of your thoughts, brain bound, i call it , gives me a dull headache. there is an art to waiting around, apparently. a craft. have i perfected that craft? waiting for change, waiting for movement, waiting for difference. the definition of insanity is doing something over and over and expecting different results. all this brain bound thinking requires mental gymnastics. who is in control of whom? am i in control of my body or is my body in control of me? my thoughts bounce backwards and forwards in my head, twisting into tangents and intrusively pushing forward until i finally take action to simmer the thoughts: throw up on the way home into this white plastic bag, crouched in this dark alley way. well now, what did i expect? i picture someone hitting my nose with a rolled newspaper. bad dog i thought once i quit starving i would be happier. i would reach this pinnacle stage of adulthood where happiness resided. i would be able to take a seat in it, relax. i wring words out of a wet rag and they plunge to the floor. maybe if i pick them up carefully, i could describe what's happening? then i could get out? i could be free? i'm like a dim child, putting squares into circles slots. anyways, waiting around. i check mirrors for years, the same reflection stares back. i eat burnt toast for years, the same emptiness grows in my chest. i drink diet coke for years, the same satisfaction singes my stomach. maybe this time, this year, this moment, the toast and diet coke will do something different for me? i wait. maybe if i dress it up a bit dress up this raging fire of an eating disorder, lol : i'll layer my dirty starving habits into my personality, knit my actions into my character, weave my eating disorder into my hair and the men that i fuck, tattoo the feeling from purging into my chest so it permanently resides, pandora's box , or maybe allow my body to heal over the pain, scarring my eating disorder into me forever, never leaving. i wait. the times when my eating disorder has been quiet in my life, it feels like standing in a quiet desert. uninhabited, desolate, wasteland. my hobbies disappear. my personality shrinks. my hair falls out. the only song that plays is ""static"" by godspeed you black emperor on a deafening loud volume i double dog dare you to sit in a room quietly and listen to that song in its entirety . i wait in the desert. i wait and wait and wait. i have not waited around stagnantly, either. i have moved metaphorical furniture for years, making new rooms in my head. i have changed, i have adapted, i have matured, i have seen therapists. and yet, in every version of my new self, i seem to be waiting around. maybe if i bleach my insides? strip all the wallpaper, gut my veins. oh, i can smell the sweet smell of sanitary doctor's office now. nice and clean. here's my secret: when i hear listen see young girls sorry men, can't relate to you as well. no offense talk about their blooming eating disorder, i want to beat the shit out of them. there they are, just fertilizing their thoughts and tending their depression garden. they're feeding the god damn thing they're making a home for it what the fuck here's my second secret: i have tended my depression garden for years. i made a fire for it, got it a chair, and made it comfy. i'm projecting my self inflicted anger onto younger girls. i just don't want you to do the same as me, man. the real secret of this post: i know when i'm old and on my deathbed, with white porcelain hair and opaque blue eyes, my true regret will flash before me like a series of silent videos. videos of me silently waiting around, doing the same thing over and over. amp; x2 b;",
"help. i already made a post about my apparent ed and it looks like i'm on the beginning stage, so i haven't actually developed anything yet. i have a dietitian which i've been seeing for some months. she helps me with guilt when eating, binging due to boredom and all that kinds of stuff. it doesn't feel like it does much for me, since my father is always with me in her appointments and i can't tell her about my ed openly. i've been seeing several posts in social media about that kind of stuff and all sings seem to indicate that i haven't improved. sure, my eating patterns are slightly better, but my mindset is still the same. there's also my mother. it looks like she's struggling with an unhealthy relationship with food as well, and she comments on how much weight she's gained or that i shouldn't eat chocolate at night because it'll make me fat, etc. she keeps making those comments quite regularly. i told my dietitian about it without actually revealing her identity, but her tips aren't very helpful when it comes to dealing with my mother's reactions towards my diet. between my mother, my dietitian's unhelpful tips, my body image issues and the stuff that's been going on in my life i find myself wishing i could skip breakfast again or work out more to lose weight. i have no one to talk to about this and i feel trapped. what can i do to improve my relationship with food?",

"i developed bed and i need help. i ve always had an eating disorder since the beginning of high school. i was 13 then and now i m 2 . at first it was starvation but since the pandemic hit, i ve been eating recklessly. around late december of last year i ve been binging nonstop. i ve had constant days of just eating until i feel sick or get close to vomiting. i need help in how i can stop binging i know it s not a over night miracle but i m gaining weight and mentally i can t handle it. i m losing myself and my social life because i m too worried about how my weight has affected my appearance. i want to stop eating but i can t and sometimes i binge on the grossest of things. i m stuck inside my house all day because i don t have a job and my classes are all online. i m too anxious to go outside for walks bc of my weight which is dumb im aware. i need to stop this. please help i can t handle this anymore.",
"just wanting too share my progress w someone : . idk what im really meaning too say with this post, but since about mid feb ive been actively getting better and embracing it this time instead of scrambling too feel in control amp; like im deeply engaged in my ed. beginning too eat consistently, ive been trying let go of that feeling of urgency that i needed too get back into a mindset amp; routine that enabled amp; fuelled my ed instead just allowing myself too engage in nourishing myself properly and rly meaning it with no plan or end goal too make up or relapse. i dont know how well im explaining this lol but oh well ofc in the past month or so there have been slip ups amp; its all far from consistent. i think i still havent realised how many disordered thoughts r still lingering and whilst that comforts me i am now in a place where i can identify that its my ed that wants and clings too them thoughts and i myself can make the decision too tackle them or listen too them. being able too distinguish what i think vs what my ed thinks now is crazy actually quite proud of myself ahh i feel like im embracing 'recovery'? word creeps me out lol cause it feels too official and final but whatever too fast sometimes or not doing it right. almost wishing it felt harder or im not struggling enough. but then i think abt the 4 months or so before when i knew part of me desperately wanted too get better and i was fiercely pushing it away and fighting it off with fuelling my ed further cause i was just so scared. i kinda consider that period that id wanted amp; was ready too recover for longer than i thought. and theres no such thing as too quick: honestly just taking it day by day lol i could wake up and completely change my mind tomorrow but at least ive seen what recov can bring and how good it can feel: i think im just writing this too acknowledge how far ive come myself. no one in my family knows abt my ed in the first place amp; i think my friends just think im still engaging in it. i've thought abt telling my best friend how things have changed recently but thats scary and feels like ive gotta commit too it then oh well getting of track lol just wanted too come ok there and share with someone. i know reddit has been so helpful to me in the past and i hope all of you struggling can find peace in yourselves soon and allow yourself too get better too ",
"how to approach my situation while keeping my girlfriend in mind. tw: there will be numbers involved so i've been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now, when we started dating she was in a rough spot and undiagnosed with anorexia, a few months into dating her parents sent her to a recovering hospital that focuses on eating disorders. things happend there that are a whole other topic, however she got back after about a month being there and obviously there was a change in physical appearance by becoming healthier, i stuck with her the entire time and it's been over a year now shes been out. since she has been out she has still struggled mentally with her disorder but hasn't ever completely relapsed. i'm very proud of her and i dont hold her to any expectation except to keep doing well and trying to help her not hard relapse. the issue i'm struggling with though is ive gained a pretty significant amount of weight since she has gotten back, i'm not saying it's her fault but i do know a part of why that happend is because anytime she would eat or get snacks she would ask me if i wanted some and if i didnt she wouldnt want to be eat it and because of that i didnt want her to not eat so i ended up eating alot more than i normally would snack wise and everything and i have gained about 4 5 pounds over the past year give or take. again not saying it's her fault but i know it played a role. i've been at a point of wanted to lose that weight back for a few months now i just dont know how to go about it while keeping her in mind because i know it could make her want to work out alot and lose weight as well. obviously there is nothing wrong with a healthy workout routine but i'm afraid she would go to an extreme like she has before. i want to get back to my healthy athletic weight without making her feel insecure or uncomfortable and i just dont know how to go about that. so if there are any suggestions or anything i'd love the advice. and i hope this was an okay post to make without causing any problems and i'm proud of each and everyone of you : ",
eating makes me nauseous. ever time i feel like i try to eat i just feel really sick. i usually don t throw up because i ll stop after a couple of bites but i want to be able to eat full meals. i have a snack here and there because i m trying to listen to my body but i feel like it s never enough. i also know it s not healthy just to eat snack foods and i need things with real nutrition. i do eat protein bars and drink protein shakes but any other advice? i ve been trying to increase my calories to a normal level for a 22f but can never get close.,

"does anyone else throw up amp; run a fever not intentionally when you are restricting?. after two or three days of restricting heavily i wake up in the morning with a fever and i usually throw up. this is not intentional at all because i hate being sick and feeling sick. i can not talk to a doctor about this, for obvious reasons but i still want to know what s going on with my body and the reason for this. if anyone has any answers please reply, thanks : ",
pretty sure by restricting i fucked myself up fully. so here s the thing. i used to do omad 5 days a week. anyway the dizziness happened obviously but here s the thing now that i m recovering and on days where i eat normally obviously i m still dizzy. what did i do?,
"i have arfid and i'm worried it will soon transition into anorexia soon.. tw: numbers i have arfid which is avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. the texture, smell and taste of most food is repulsive and it keeps me from eating most of the time. it had nothing to do with weight loss at the beginning and i was really scared of how much weight i was losing especially since it was accompanied by a lot of tremors and weakness cause of my low nutrient intake. i've told my mom about this multiple times and she's just been happy that i'm losing weight. i've been overweight most of my life. she's overweight as well and has serious body image issues that she also projects on to me. she's been calling me fat my entire life while doing nothing to encourage healthy eating or exercise only unhealthy diets. now that i've lost about 4 lbs in 3 months she finally likes how i look and has been praising my body. now i'm worried to gain weight again cause i don't want to deal with her comments about my body anymore. my arfid is triggered by stress caused by school. so once that calms down it might go away. when that happens and i'm eating the amount of calories that i should be i'll probably gain weight again. i don't know if i will go back to eating a healthy amount of food when most food isn't repulsive anymore. if i gain weight i know my body image issues will get worse. she just told me not to gain the weight back so i can fit into clothes for a vacation. i made one of the few foods i can eat just before that now i don't want to eat it. i wish she would stop.",

"i need your advice. so, i have been in binge restrict cycle for quite some time. and i tried to get out of it by eating more through out the day but binging seemed to just be a habit or something. and of course, the guilt that comes after it. i feel like i'm caught in a loop. i talked about it to my therapist and she hasn't given me any advice at all, she just said i need to stop this. so i'm asking you guys if you have any advice on stopping the binging. i would really appreciate if you share what worked for you on this matter. i'm a high school student and soon off to university. i'm under a lot of stress and i know that ed can come out again because of it. but i really want to get rid of this. thank you : ",

"a never ending cycle. i started having a bad relationship with food from my childhood. i was 6 or 7 when my sister was diagnosed with anorexia, and i've been absorbing all the toxicity of that horrible situation since then. my mother was depressed and had multiple crisis while my sister was severely underweight and had no intention to recover. i obviously was too young to understand what was going on, so i unconsciously stored all the information i was able to capture. also, i grew up with a extremely toxic friend: she was obsessing over her body, trying to be as skinny as possible even though she was clearly underweight. to make things even worse, my cousin used to repeatedly tell her sister and me to go on a diet, ignoring the fact we were literally just 1 . i basically spent my whole childhood getting upset because of my body and trying to fix the problem with useless diet plans. my coping mechanism was, unexpectedly, eating more than i should. after spending a lot of years crying over my body in a desperate need to lose weight, i decided it was the right moment to change my habits once and for all. i'll spare you the details of how i got to this point, but in 2 19 i was diagnosed with anorexia and had to start a therapy. the pandemic played me dirty, and now i ended up having the opposite problem: around the end of 2 21 i relapsed ending up eating a lot and bingeing every once in a while. as expected, i gained too much weight i won't specify the kgs, but im up 5 kilos of my ideal weight and my mental health is getting worse day by day. even if i agree with myself i'll go on a diet restrict the next day, i find myself struggling to eat less than i do. i'm stuck in this terrible situation. knowing that i can't stand being fatter than my sister and friends getting to see their perfect bodies and eating habits everyday triggers me a lot , i still unable to make an effective change. i hate my body and i can't stop thinking about it. how do i stop this cycle? id just like to live a healthy life, without my mood depending on what i eat during my day. i feel like i lost all my willpower and i need it back now. any advice? feel free to ask questions if necessary to understand my situation better",

"my eating disorder is ruining my relationship. for the entirety of my relationship going on a year soon , i've had an eating disorder not sure exactly which one specifically, i originally thought anorexia and now i'm thinking bulimia... restrictive in some way, i digress . anyways, my girlfriend has always been insanely supportive of all my mental health issues cause boy is there a lot and i appreciate her so much for that. that being said, in the past 3 or 4 months my eating disorder has gotten a lot worse. i've had a pretty bad eating disorder for 2 3 years now, but it had mostly just been restriction, and now i've been purging a lot. it began around the beginning of the new year when i purged a few times in one week which had never happened before , and i told her i was scared. i've gotten so much worse since then. she was supportive as ever, but since then it's become a nearly every day, maybe even a couple of times a day thing. she won't say so, but i think this is really putting a strain on my relationship. she really wants me to get help, but i really don't think i want to. i know i need help, i can feel the physical strain this disorder is putting on my body... i just can't bring myself to want it. i don't want to be dishonest with her and i try to be as transparent as possible, but i know she's also going through her own shit as well. i don't want her to have to be my therapist i have no therapist , but i also don't want to hide things from her. i feel so shitty, but no matter how hard she tries, i can't make myself want to recover. no matter how hard i try, i can't make myself want to recover. i have issues other than my eating disorder and have numerous mental health problems and am a teenager living in a not so great home, and all these factors make it harder for me to get, or even want to get help. i guess i'm kind of just venting here, but i just don't want to ruin my relationship because of this disorder, but i don't have it in me to recover yet either. if context helps, i will be graduating high school soon and will be on my own then. i'm thinking of maybe pursuing help once i am on my own in college. despite what she may say, i don't think that given my current family situation, getting help is feasible. no clue if this will give anyone a better picture either, but i am a lesbian, so we are both girls well, i'm not really a girl, but for simplicity's sake, let's just go with that if that gives you any more insight into our relationship? i guess all i'm asking for is advice from maybe someone who understands. i don't want to put all my baggage on her, but i also don't want to be dishonest with her. i know she just wants the best for me, but i can't bring myself to want help. thanks.",
"purged for the first time in months tw. trigger warning content warning today i purged for the first time in months. i was never trying to recover, but purging has caused me minor issues and i do worry about the effects. i feel no guilt. well, i did when getting ready to purge, but during and after i didn't. but i didn't get the high either. maybe it's because i barely got anything up. i had just eating 2 large choc chip muffins and all that really came up was the water i drank. i have up bc it was going everywhere and i got so tired. ive had my ed and have been purging for 1 years. i always feel weak after for like an hour. but that was 3 4 hours ago and i can hardly stand bc i have no strength. my chest hurts. i feel like i can't get a deep enough breath. i can't walk even 2 seconds not exaggerating without having to stop and bend over to catch my breath. im 99 sure im fine, but there will always be the worry. what if i have heart problems and don't know it and am going to give myself a heart attack? but why isn't that enough to actually stop me? im sure it's becoming a regular thing for me again until tmi? 5 fingers doesn't even work anymore why does that always happen? i feel like it's just me . i don't know why i wrote this. i guess because there's no one else to vent to about it and i wanna be told im okay. lt;3",

"i m going insane. trying to change my ed again from binge to bulimia and soon to anorexia?. edit: i am insane. this is a lot to read, so thank you. last paragraph is the most meaningful to me, so skip there if you d like too. i started off with a binge ed when i was younger, gained a lot of weight and felt bad about myself. and at some point in the past couple years or so i starting exercising or restricting after binges to be even so i wouldn t gain weight and eventually so i would be losing 2lbs a week. which is a healthy amount to lose but i didn t do it in a healthy way. everyone i know has congratulated me on my weight loss 52lbs and i just went from obese to overweight on a bmi chart. i was thinking the other day and my brain thought it would be a good idea to swap to just not eating, or having negative net calories. i mean if i didn t eat i would lose weight faster. plus i had a reallyyy bad binge. so i planned on eating next to nothing just a week to make up for it. so for the past five days i ve ate on average 2 calories a day while doing 25 3 k steps. i m cold, confused, sore, and dizzy, but gosh darn it the high from not eating, plus all the steps is euphoric. i feel like after just 5 days it s becoming an addiction. going on multiple jogs and walks a day to get my steps in makes me somehow feel more energetic than i ve ever been in my life. i have so much energy but it s like i m not awake at the same time. this is fun, i m having fun, and i don t want to stop sneaking around my house, lying to people about eating. sneaking out late at night to jog. i m a straight a introverted student who is super nice to people. i don t smoke, do drugs or half the bad things other students do. now i m lying and it feels so good.. every time i get chills i smile. every step goal i set another. just 2 more, just 1 more, more, more. the sight of food makes me nauseous now, before i would feel guilt after eating but now i feel guilty for even making food to be eaten. no one cares when you have a binge ed. you are just fat. when you have bulimia and are losing weight at healthy pace even if you say out loud, i ate a weeks worth of food last night, so i m exercising it off no one cares. i ve had people tell me i m really dedicated for that. but my brain just wants me to reach the label of anorexic, which has a weight requirement, and since i m starting off the top end of overweight it will take me a while, but it s all i want right now, and what i ve wanted for 3 years. i want people to know i m so dedicated. that i am so dedicated that i m able to be sickly underweight, and i m not just a fat slob.",

"nervous with eating and really struggling, not sure if i have an eating disorder. so i m not really sure if what i experience is disordered eating or an eating disorder but i already deal with arfid and i also deal with body image issues and severe anxiety. but anyways my relationship with food is really weird. cause sometimes i will eat and not really think about anything negative and i m kind of fine with food. but other times i ll get nervous eating and i physically won t be able to eat sometimes and usually with my anxiety that makes it worse. i don t always actively avoid eating, sometimes i do but not really. i try to make sure i have at least a meal a day if not two although i don t eat much because again my anxiety . i ve been feeling really horrible and depressed lately and my anxiety is through the roof so i m having trouble eating. on top of my body issues i find myself thinking how i m afraid of eating more than one meal a day because what if i gain weight i m of a healthy weight as of rn but i m not in shape so i have a stomach and i m embarrassed by it . i m also afraid of exercising because what if that just makes all of this worse. my mom i think suffers from disordered eating or maybe even an eating disorder. she has a bad relationship with food. my sister had one too. and also recently my friend s sister said to me that i m really skinny now and that she loves it and that i m perfect. her dad though said i m too thin and need to eat i know i m not actually too thin so that comment doesn t even really make sense to me . it s weird though because i feel like while i don t have a full blown eating disorder i m definitely in danger of developing one and it makes me really really nervous because idk what to do to stop it, my mom definitely wouldn t understand she barely understands with my anxiety and i m worried she ll make me eat more than i want to. i don t count calories or weigh myself a lot i m lazy and i also know weighing myself will not help me . i kinda go in cycles with my relationship with food, the way i feel about it might be impacted by my anxiety. and i know i should eat because i need it to function and i try to make myself but there s a lot of things inside of me that make it hard to do so. idrk what s wrong with me but i m hoping to seek some support with all of this because it is really hard. i m currently looking for therapists i have so many issues that choosing one with specific subject specialties is kind of impossible . idk if my age is important but i m 19 btw.",
"increasing calories?. i ve struggled with eating for as long as i could remember but fall of 2 2 was probably the worst and i lost about 3 pounds. after i was able to maintain my weight again for a few months, i started weight lifting at the gym and have been very consistent for well over a year now. however, i know i m not consuming enough calories. i drink protein shakes and eat foods high in protein and try to force myself to eat snacks through the day, but i m still not able to eat full meals. sometimes i know i m hungry and i know i need to eat and i just can t. i ll stare at my food until it makes me nauseous to look at. i ve been trying to gain 1 lbs for about 6 months and have had absolutely no progress. i don t really do any cardio or fat burning exercises. i ve tried forcing myself to eat breakfast, i ve tried eating chicken rice chicken pasta and other basic meal prep things, but it s never that good and i get sick of it so fast. i love to cook so i make myself dinner a few times a week but i end up eating maybe half a serving before i feel sick. i always bring a lunch to work and never eat it or maybe eat half. i feel like i want to eat so bad but i just can t. any advice or anyone dealt with something similar after recovering from an ed?",

"my binges are not usually foods i crave . and sometimes they are even foods i dislike. i binge on weird things.. i hear people say that they binge on foods they are craving, or foods they told themselves they couldn t eat, but for me that s almost never the case. it s whatever i happen to be eating, and every food can turn into a binge. or anything i look at really. a couple days ago was pancakes that were in pre portioned packages, i ate a weeks worth of pancakes in less than an hour tonight i had a salad, and next thing i know i was shovelling just plain mixed greens down my throat, no dressing, just straight leaves. it was kinda bitter, and vegetables are not something i ever crave. i finished the whole huge tub in less than 4 minutes. does anyone else have this happen? my binges are sometimes even with foods i hate; like peas. sometimes i just wonder what is up with my brain, because i binge on the weirdest varieties of foods. for most people it seems like a category: desserts, salty snacks, carbs, crave foods, foods that have been restricted. for me it s all over the place: sweet foods, vegetables, bland foods, spicy foods, salty, bitter, literal spices. these are some of the things i ve binged on in the past two months or so cocoa and cinnamon mixed together chicken broth with cumin swerve brown sugar peas pancakes peperettes had like 1 3 of a cup of grape seed oil, with salt mixed in it. salmon field greens spinach mix mac and cheese with shrimp brownies carrots gum sometimes i randomly eat a tsp or even tbsp of random spices or salt, because i get an intense urge to try them. i lick my plates always and occasionally eat ingredients separately which is probably bizarre to most ex. vanilla extract, cocoa powder.. . i ",

"started dating a super fit guy that works out 6 times a week, and hes triggering me.. he knows i got out of treatment last fall. but what he doesnt know is that i still count everything and restrict myself from going over my tdee today we went out and shared a nutella pizza had to prepare myself and pep talk myself a lot to do this, because it was hard ngl. nutella and pizza is still a fearfood of mine . it felt good since we shared it and he and i seemed to enjoy the pizza at first. but then after a while he commented something really triggering. just imagine how much calories thats in this and then he took a full fork och nutella scraped of from the pizza and said like look . i dont think he has an ed, but he did sound a bit unsure about eating the rest after, which he didn t because he said he was full look, i couldnt finish my last bit because of his comment about the calories and the fact that he didnt eat all of his 1 2 pizza. now a few hours after our date he texted me is it just me or do you also feel a bit weird after that pizza? now im going to be quite honest. there were nothing wrong with the pizza and my stomach feels fine im wondering if he has anxiety over the pizza, bevause he gets a lot of anxiety in generall over a lot of things. how can i make this work? if hes too fixated on food because of his training he will keep being a trigger for me because he reminds me of all the things i used to do. we really connect with eachother overall and he is truly like no other guy ive met, so i reallt want it to work between us. my plan is to tell him about me being triggerd when calories are mentioned. but then thwre is this knowing thought of mine that know that just his lifestyle will keep me thinking about training, body, etc. i even sometimes feel like i need to be as fit as him because thats pherhaps what he likes since he works out so much, or that he should be with someone that also works out as hard as him.",

"is this an eating disorder?. i ve made myself throw up bout 3 4 times throughout 8 months. i don t do it when i binge, i do it when i m counting my calories and i eat over. like if i ate a piece of pizza after i already at all my calories for the day, i would feel bad and regret it. i also think i binge. idk what is considered a binge, but sometimes when i m sad or even when i m not sad, i will eat even when i m not hungry. i get uncomfortably full and eat rapidly. i don t puke after this, but i do tell myself i m not allowed to eat tomorrow or only a little. that eventually ends in a binge. i think i m stuck in a binge restrict cycle. is this an eating disorder? what is considered a binge? yesterday i ate 4 or 5 rice krispy treats one after another. is that a binge?",
"i keep vomiting food i don't love or crave does anyone know what this is?. last wednesday, the 9th, i suddenly started vomiting profusely. i called 111, the non emergency health line in england, and ended up in a amp;e and the ucc before being prescribed medicine and being told to only eat bland foods like toast. i followed those instructions and it was alright at first until i suddenly started vomiting again. in hindsight, i only started vomiting toast after i started getting bored of it and craving other foods. i was then told to go 24 hours without food and to try toast again. i did so and vomited it immediately after i finished it. i had been craving some biscuits on my desk and ended up giving into it, both because i was extremely hungry and just desperate for flavour. for some reason, i didn't throw up the biscuits. immediately, i assumed i must be having a reaction to an ingredient. i tried a couple more things and discovered that chocolate was totally fine but salted crisps and pain au chocolats weren't okay, and would quickly get vomited once i finished them. on a whim, i decided to try a flavour of crisps i preferred more, prawn cocktail. for some reason, i didn't vomit this. this didn't make any sense to me as these had all the ingredients in the salted crisps and more. this then lead me to the possibility that i'm not vomiting from any sort of allergic reaction. instead, i'm vomiting over a cognitive reaction. looking back, the biscuits, chocolate and favourable flavour of crisps were foods i really wanted to eat and everything else was foods i was okay with. i've gone almost 21 years without having any kind of food allergy or eating disorder. this has come on very suddenly and i'm making a post here in the off chance someone might know what's going on with me. if you have any idea what this is or any advice, please leave a comment.",

"i wanna wear this dress, but i m scared of the comments. i recently bought the dress and was dolled up, and my mom took pictures and posted them on facebook. i got a lot of love from my friends and family, and today while at church, my mom showed my uncle and great grandfather. i haven t seen them in almost a month since i ve stopped going to church, but they told my mom that they miss me and wanna see me in the dress since they thought i looked pretty. when my mom told me this, i at first agreed because i didn t mind wearing it. it s a pretty dress that fits my curvy form and it made me feel confident for the first time to show the true outline of my tummy. but i quickly changed my mind after remembering my aunts, cousin, great grandma, and grandma were gonna be there. they always have something to say about how i look, how i dress, how fat my arms were getting, etc. and the had no problem showing it. my grandma was always the worst because no one has the guts to stand up to her, but me. even my own dad, her son, won t say anything when she makes comments like that. i know she will point out every flaw, every curve, and tell me i look too grown and no one will say anything. i wanna wear the dress because i miss my great grandfather and i know it ll make him happy. and god forbid this, but he s old and who knows if yk but i m scared of the backlash i ll get. i ve struggled with eating disorders for a lot of my life and currently am going through a small rough patch and don t want things to get more worse. but i wanna do this, but is it worth the risk? any advice?",

"fuck this disorder in the a . so yesterday i had a birthday party, and in the morning i had a snack pack cheese and crackers thing, 17 cals, then i made myself a zero shirley temple 1 cals 1 can sprite zero, 2 tbsp grenadine, and 2 maraschino cherries it's simple and yummy, aka cherry sprite with flare. anyways. to me, i had eaten enough . i went in for the party with a i'm going to eat and have a merry time, and not care about the food, i had a large muffin and a piece of cake. then, after the majority of people left mind you, this was at a public place, not a home. we were playing card games , i had started noticing a lot twitches in my hands, lips and tongue. i've had this before with low potassium, but i'm an idiot and let it go. so the night proceeds and i'm now starting to partially black out while sitting down, and i'm unsteady in my seat like i'm drunk or something, this is a caf we're in, and we're not drinking. so i take one of the emergency potassium pills i had i use to get them prescribed when i abused laxatives, so i have some left over and i use them rarely, in cases like this because i'm stupid and i don't go to the hospital like i should . i was legitimately scared at this point; i had never felt quite this bad before. my boyfriend and his friend suggest i should probably eat something and i second that idea because i don't want to kill over on the caf floor and make a scene. i go up and to get a sandwich and some chips. when i was looking at the sandwiches, i almost fell over and couldn't properly read the names because my vision was blackening and was in and out of focus. as i ate the sandwich, my boyfriend brought me an orange juice because he's a thinker, just in case it was low blood sugar, even though i just had cake an hour earlier. i began to get my vision back; that was the scariest part for me, not being able to see, then i finished everything, mentally being screamed at by my ed, and my stomach feeling absolutely awful. but i'm glad i ate the fucking sandwich and chips i felt better, not all the way, though. i was still twitching some but not as bad, but my unsteady feeling and blackout vision issues had gone away. not 1 , but i didn't feel like death anymore. now, here i am the day after, back to restricting when there is no rhyme or reason for this disorder, and we do the shit it says without question. stay strong out there; one day, we'll be better. tl;dr had a potential medical emergency, some potassium, and a sandwich saved the day.",

"i'm not diagnosed, but i'd love some help advice . i'm a minor and i think i might have an ed. food eating causes a lot of stress and overthinking for me. problems really started around december. i started counting calories and felt guilty after i ate. i slept in to skip meals and weighed myself daily. this lasted for about a month. then i got back to over eating. i felt like i had no control over what i ate and felt super guilty after. i also gained back the weight i lost and felt really bad about it. i was still weighing myself and still hated myself. i wanted to get back ""old me"" who ate less. i realized that won't happen and started to panic. i started going on our treadmill daily. when i manage to minimise the amount of food i eat, i'm happy about it for some reason.tbh i'm always scared this ""control"" i have will go away again. it's also common for me to daydream about food. how i really want to eat something, but then the thought of calories and gaining weight stops me. after a while i can't stop myself anymore and eat a bunch of snacks. i sometimes hurt myself just cause i feel so much hatred towards myself. and i get triggered by ed s? idk how to explain. it simply makes me feel anxious or something. i'm honestly confused. this causes me so much stress. i'd be glad to hear any advice ",
"i just want this to be over. i am a sixteen year old girl and my eating disorder started just after i turned fourteen, after years of hating my body. always had a bad body image, since six years old. i felt i wasnt good enough, ugly and fat although i was always a completely normal weight, a little bit chubby at times but totally healthy. then at fourteen i eventually started starving myself because of debilitating anxiety about my body. it started when i realized that skipping meals made me look less bloated and thus 'skinnier'. my stomach was always my worst insecurity anyway. when id eat a bit more i would get so anxious id have panic attacks when looking in the mirror, because of even minor bloating. then it escalated to restricting heavily for months and becoming just a pound from underweight. i felt so bad all the time but at least i finally was.. skinny, as id always wanted. then something snapped amp; i started binging. my mental health went to shit. because my body wasnt used to digesting the food, ironically that caused me actual, painful, uncomfortable bloating which convinced me i had gained a lot of weight. i got depressed amp; started self harming. was put into inpatient ed treatment. gained weight, more and more, until i was at a healthy weight for my body amp; hated myself more than ever. crash dieted, binged, repeated over and over again for a year. was at all kinds of different mental facilities because of my anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation and general unableness to live normally. then got a bit stabler as i was put on medication, and moved into a psychiatric unit. still live here ate mostly normally. bad body image, but managed it. i lost a bit weight at times, then binged it back, but i was generally so stable i could continue normal living despite of it. was happy, at times. got better. always wanted to be skinnier, but it didnt take over my life. had some periods of restricting, then started binging more severely, sometimes so much id throw up the next day accidentally, just because how much i ate and how sick it made me then go without eating a few days and try to get ""back on track"". lived a winter eating pretty normally, sometimes counted calories, sometimes didn't, no severe binging mostly. felt that i was doing well, actually. then decided i should, this time, actually lose weight, and take control, and that i could have the pretty body i always wanted this time. was determined to do it, ate 1 12 cals for a month. then snapped again despite trying to tell myself its ""so easy for me"" and got into a compulsive binging thats gone on for almost the last two weeks. so, repeating the cycle again. the cycle ive been repeating for two years. hating my body. for some time liking my body, but still not feeling good enough. wanting to be skinny, getting skinnier, feeling still bad and gaining the weight back, always in the normal """"healthy"""""" weight range. everyone thinks i am recovered from my eating disorder. i never chose to recover, i was forced to. i felt out of control. i always wished i could go back. i am tired. i am so tired. im having the same kinds of thoughts about my body weight as i did at fourteen, as it started. its gone on for too long. i cant tell anyone. they'd start monitoring my eating and weight. then i couldnt lose weight, and i would have to live with a body i dont like, which would most likely cause me to binge, which would alienate me from my body, which would make me feel even worse. out of control. as its been. i dont want this anymore. im tired. so tired. sorry for the bad writing i am crying as i write this. dont speak english as my first language, cant bother to think about it so hard. i feel so hopeless.",
"anyone else depressed because you have relapsed? need some kind words. hi all, long story short, i am a 21 year old male who used to be quite overweight. my coping mechanism for anxiety was to eat, and naturally it caused its repercussions. this habit of mine lowered my will to do things i would normally do when healthier, and my days were moistened of sadness. but i overcame this during mid 2 2 and decided to change. success came to me after jogging regularly. life became happier. however, i was always obsessive, and i mean acutely obsessive, over my diet; i spat food, did not eat sufficiently, and smoked cigarettes to suppress my appetite, developing an addiction. and it is also worth mentioning that i was still unsure of my body, as i had always been bullied over it by family and peers in a classic manner. i then licked anorexia closely, while seeing an obese person in the mirror when in reality i was the other extreme opposite. this would sadden me deeply. then, i started gaining weight again, and now i am overweight because i either eat too much or nothing at all. this is ignominious, and it embarrasses me to write this, because i do not even reveal this to my loving girlfriend. i am humbled, brought down, and beaten by this. i still am obsessive over my body; looking at mirrors, window reflections, and avoiding cameras at all costs happens to me daily. i have thoughts of suicide and self hatred, which is an unwise way to fight the problem. nothing can bring me peace anymore, and i cannot exist in ease with myself, accepting my own body which is deservingly hated. i do not know what to call this. mine is a problem of anxiety, i would think, but i do not wish to diagnose myself. any kind words, experiences, and tips would be welcomed in my heart. thank you for reading.",

""you'd never loose weight on a diet and gain it back"". she has a history of doing that. then she straight up tells me i used to get skinnier a while back and without needing to diet too like no...i was very deep into anorexia and it was in 2 19 2 2 ...i remembered because i starved to achieve that body. she said she was glad for me that time, that i was finally loosing as well. now i think i've become bulimic because i keep binging and restricting all the time, i cannot be trusted around food. she even went as far as telling me i ate so much junk in february and it was like i couldn't even stop....yet never questioned that there was something deeply wrong other than ""emotional overeating"". i feel like i just need to restrict much more so people take me seriously and start being concerned but yet again, their hateful comments trigger me to binge. i'm stuck and hopeless. can anyone relate or give me good advice? recovery is not an option because i need to loose weight and i only know how to loose via restricting....",

"thanks mom . just to vent so i just relapsed, starting with cutting my intake down to under 1 calories with the intention of moving down. i used to restrict significantly lower when i was a freshman in college and that s what caused me to be booted from that college and in to heavy monitoring of my intake and mental health. about 9 months ago they put me on zoloft, and while it did help my depression, i gained about 4 pounds in 3 months and it caused me to panic so bad they changed me to a different medication. the new meds let me lose about 1 lbs and then i plateaued, it caused me a lot of stress but i wanted to try and lose weight healthily and not relapse. then i got an amazing deal on plane tickets for a vacation in paris next month, and while i was elated for the first few minutes, i soon realized that i would be there looking as i look now and i felt nauseous because of how i look and that i just hate it. that sparked me to relapse to where i am with 1 calories to try and lose weight before i go without a full blown relapse. and then today happened, i mentioned the fact that i was trying to get in shape and lose weight healthily to my mom, and she told me that was great because i had ballooned in weight and that the last time i was fat at least it was easier to hide depending on what i wore , and sufficed to say, that has triggered a full blown relapse. so that s nice",

"i don't want to get help. i've had trouble with food all my life but my complexion is genetically skinny so it went practically unnoticed, got a few comments from time to time but nothing really relevant. about a year ago i went through a very difficult time and found comfort in food which obviously led to me gaining a considerable amount of weight but i kind of didn't notice till my sister pointed out. at first i tried not to worry too much but then my clothes wouldn't fit me and the rest of my family began to make comments too so i decided to do something about it. i became a vegetarian to stop eating certain types of food without being questioned about it and it worked great, i started to loose weight and even felt more healthy but from there things started to be a little difficult for me, i became kind of obsessed with nutritional values and got pretty restrictive with what i ate. it got to the point of eating one meal a day and reduce hunger by eating a fruit or drinking tea water. now i'm skinner than i was before i gained weight but i still don't feel satisfied with my body, the problem is the health consequences of my weight lost are becoming difficult to hide. two days ago i fainted while going down the stairs, luckily i didn't get seriously hurt but my mom got really worried and basically told me she's going to help me ""get help"" but i don't want to and i can't talk with anyone about it cause they will tell me things i do not want to hear. right now i don't know what to do, my mom is making appointments with doctors and a therapist and i'm grateful for that cause i know not everyone has someone to support them but i don't want to gain weight again, even the thought deeply frightens me and to know that i'm skinny enough to make people worry about me kind of makes me feel rewarded ? and think that i'm doing a good job. sorry about the long rant but i'm really lost right now and my head is hell. sorry if there are any mistakes, english is not my first language ",
"in need of your help to raise awareness for eating disorder. hi everyone i'm lucie, and i m doing my undergraduate thesis project about eating disorder to honor my experience with ed, and i d love to talk to some of you who have experience in participating in a support group, in either online or offline format, and both long term participants and people who tried and stopped participating would be very helpful to my project dm me if you are interested in helping long version: my name is lucie tsao, and i am currently in hong kong. under the crazy diet culture here and very strict body requirements for women, my life always gets so influenced by them. i have always struggled with my eating habits because growing up even my parents always encouraged the eating disorder behaviors. after i finally got to know the concept of eating disorder, i was able to gradually understand my behaviors and take control of them as good as i could. during my journey, i have gotten to know how little eating disorder is informed to the general public. as a sociology student, i thought i would grasp the chance and dedicate my thesis project to eating disorder. my purpose is to bring more understanding to the subject of eating disorder from a sociological perspective, and even within such a broad subject, eating disorder is not studied about as much as it should. for my project, we me and another girl who has also suffered from eating disorder are focusing on eating disorder as a social movement, and the major circumstance is eating disorder support group both online and offline format . inspired by the aids movement and also aa support groups, we think this is a very interesting topic that would bring more awareness to the concept of eating disorder in general, and there is clearly a research gap in this perspective. because we re located in asia currently, it is very rare to find people who have had experience in the support groups. i m here reaching out to you guys, hoping that we could maybe gather some useful and meaningful knowledge during the interview, you guys will be fully capable of stopping the interview or not answering any questions that make you uncomfortable, and since it is a sociological study, it is meant not to explore ed as a psychological disease but a disorder with social meanings and influences. i would love to hear from anyone who is interested in helping us raise awareness for ed ",

"my partner wants me to restrict my diet more. background: i have a history of bulimia cycles of restriction and bingeing . early 2 2 i went through a kind of long and extreme restriction phase and lost a significant amount of weight in 2 months. during this time my partner never seemed concerned and even praised me for my ""progress"" even though i told them that i was only eating one meal a day basically about 4 calories . over the past couple of years i have moved states, started a new job, my partner has transitioned from mtf... a lot has been going on. it's been a really high stress period in my life. weirdly, i've started medications and completed a long round of therapy and i think my attitude towards food has been better than ever. i have gained a significant amount of weight back since early 2 2 , more than i lost. i've definitely struggled with this but i figure it is the cost of acquiring a healthy relationship with food. i figure until i stop the restriction cycle, i can't really focus on eating a health optimized diet anyway. i feel like i'm almost to the point where binges have stopped or at least are no longer out of control. the problem i'm currently having: i've been having really bad gi issues for the past 18 mos or so. i've always just attributed it to stress bad eating habits, but i'm starting to think it's more than just that. i told my partner that i was considering getting checked out by a doctor for celiac as a starting point, because i already have autoimmune issues and i want to eliminate that as a potential cause. before i could even finish she started grilling me about different foods i've eaten and whether or not those caused an upset stomach i explained no, not always but celiac can develop at any time . then she proceeded to lecture me for 3 minutes about how she's noticed that i've gained weight since we have been living apart i moved for work and that i didn't used to eat so many processed foods. she repeatedly mentioned my weight but would also say, ""of course i'm not concerned about that... i'm worried about your health"". she does biomedical research and so was discussing the role of fructose on metabolism and that she was concerned that i was developing serious metabolism issues. she expressed that she would prefer if i only ate foods that i cook myself and cut refined carbs and sugars out of my diet. my issue is this: she is objectively right that this would be an improvement to my health and that the rapid weight gain is indicative of a metabolic issue. but i already have conditions endometriosis, thyroid dysfunction , not to mention the constant weight cycling throughout my life, that contribute to that. my activity level has also reduced considerably i also had a major injury requiring surgery 6 mos ago . i'm not saying diet isn't important, but that i really need to get my head straight re: food before i can healthily even consider ""cutting out"" categories of food yes, even sweets . i argued that my disordered eating is a much bigger threat to my health than my fructose consumption or even weight gain but she was kind of fighting me on it and kept bringing up my weight gain as ""evidence"" of an issue that wasn't there before. i get that this probably comes from a place of love, but it really does seem like she is more concerned about my weight than my actual health since she wasn't really listening to my explanation of my average diet and gi symptoms. any advice on how to handle this? i don't want to punish her for her concern but at the same time, this type of framing is really damaging. we only see each other every couple months and now i'm anxious about eating around her at all.",
"do i have an eating disorder?. i ve never experienced this before however i ve seen it first hand because i ve been in psych wards with ed patients and had many friends with eds. i ve always hated my body with a passion. it s ruled over my life for over a year now. it s been such a burden on me for so long now and it got to the point after weighing myself where i had enough and i started to notice myself slowly decrease my meals down to three small bowls a day and then down to nearly nothing. i obsessively started looking at myself in the mirror trying to notice if i d been losing weight. i also train for surf skis three times a week in the mornings. after weighing myself food became my enemy and i ve been scared to eat pretty much anything. i ve lost an incredible amount of weight and i weigh myself obsessively and i look so much skinnier and it s become an obsession. whenever i eat the smallest thing to try and get energy so i can function and think straight, i do 1 sit ups, i try and walk as much as i can and drink as much water as possible. i m starting to feel dizzy and like i m going to collapse all the time. i ve memorised many low calorie foods and how many calories per 1 grams they have and i measure it on the kitchen scale when i do eat. all i can think about is my weight and how i can lose more. i insult myself every day and tell myself i can t eat or i will gain weight. gaining weight is the scariest thing in the whole world. ive never hated myself more. even though i m losing a kilo a day at this rate i keep finding more insecurities and i feel like i m just getting fatter and it feels like the scales are lying and i haven t changed but everyone else is saying i m so much skinnier but each time i lose weight i just stare at myself in the mirror until i feel fat again. i m not self diagnosing, i just want advice or help on what it might be or what the hell is going through my head right now.",

"what the hell do i have. so in june like 8 months ago i developed an ed with primarily symptoms of anorexia nervosa. i dipped down very quickly from eating a normal or more than normal amount to tw numbers an average of 25 calories per day it was on a weekly schedule, i had a 2 google docs and a sheet to keep track of everything and lost about another tw numbers 4 pounds in 6 weeks. i started eating a bit more and gradually worked up to a still low but sustainable amount. but now i'm dealing with some other things. two different things kinda showed up at the same time. for one, i've begun obsessing on eating healthy not necessarily less . secondly, i've also just stopped liking a lot of foods. i can't tell if it's a genuine dislike or if my brain is convincing me i don't like it because i deem it as ""bad"". tw for this whole bit maybe? describing what i eat don't eat for context, here's a brief list of what i dislike and think is unhealthy: any meat, nuts, anything with added sugar, butter or margarine, oil, anything breaded, any sauces, potatoes, anything processed too much. what i'm allergic to: potatoes, avocados, bananas, tomatoes, garlic, onions, nuts, cocoa powder, coconut, dairy except cheese . pretty much everything that i do eat: lentil salad with spinach, red peppers, and a tiny bit of balsamic dressing , pasta with a sauce made of blended cauliflower, broccoli, and cheese, oats with chia seeds and fruit, smoothie with berries, spinach, and protein powder, and peas with paneer. if i eat anything that i don't usually, i get really nervous and can't do anything for the rest of the day. there are a few foods that i love but deem as bad pretty much just bagels and chocolate . these are symptoms of orthorexia right? but then i also just genuinely really don't like some things, like meat and anything oily. that sounds more like arfid right? is there a term for just general ed? or should i consider myself recovered from an ed but still struggling with disordered eating? i'm still getting enough nutrients but the impact of the constant mental thought is draining. so yeah what ed do i have, is it general or rotating or not anything or what??",

"eds vs disordered eating. too simplify it verrry much, what is the defining factor between eds and disordered eating? ive been researching this for ages and from what ive gathered i feel it could be too be put v basic the volume that it takes up your thoughts actions daily. i still find it crazy that purging assuming it meant more than a one off is considered disordered eating and not something more sinister. but then again my idea of disordered eating vs an ed is vastly different and part of me wants too believe that disordered eating isnt that bad emotionally taxing as an ed. again thats only because i want too believe that my issues fall into ed territory rather than disordered eating so ig my opinion of that is slightly skewed ha. but regardless, do you think an ed could be more defined in comparison by the amount it takes up in ur life brain space thoughts etc are mostly if not entirely consumed by thoughts of food, weight, eating etc. and that although disordered eating and eds can follow similar behaviours etc the defining factor lies mostly in the amount it takes up in ur life if that makes sense . thanking u : ",

"need to purge?. a bit of a vent, i'm not sure? for the past couple days, i've been mostly good not purging that is, up until today, but bad habits die hard , i've mostly just either been starving or extreme restricting amp; haven't been too worried about that. then i get the nagging feeling to purge. the best thing i can compare it to is the need to sh i havent harmed consistently in a couple years now, but i used to struggle with cutting pretty bad a couple years back . like is there any reason to? no, but you just need to , it's just that urge. i feel like purging has replaced that high that cutting once gave me, or acts in a similar kind of fashion at least. i didn't need to binge amp; purge, but sometimes your brain just clicks amp; suddenly you're binging because you just need to purge. admittedly, as much as it sucks, it felt as good as i had hoped. it just felt so fucking familiar?? to have filled my stomach amp; just emptied it, it just feels?? almost refreshing? it's fucked but it's kinda what i think is happening. do others have like a perfectly chill like restrictive cycle going for you, like you might have a piece of food when you really feel drained but you're otherwise chill being restrictive like that seems to be my healthiest option ideally the healthiest option is i wouldn't have an ed but i'm just trying to make due for the time being but suddenly you just have to purge? it's so frustrating like why can't i just restrict. also, side note to all my fellow people known to purge i know we all know our mouths are all acidic afterwards amp; i'm sure many of us have begun seeing less than thrilling effects on our teeth. it's so easily overlooked but please remember you guys can rinse your mouths with baking soda mixed in water about 1 tablespoon to 8 fluid ounces i don't know how i, someone obsessed with science amp; these kinds of things, overlooked that baking soda neutralizes acids in the months of my frequent consistent purging, so here's a friendly reminder. i don't want to encourage purging at all but i certainly want to help others out if i can. some quick tips reminders for teeth care when purging: don't brush teeth immediately afterwards, rinse with water if nothing else is available, rinse with a baking soda solution if possible, do brush your tongue it can hold a bit of acid amp; keep it around in your mouth for longer, brushing it up on your teeth stay safe y'all amp; take care of yourselves, whatever that looks like to you",

"help. hi everyone. over the years i ve struggled with eating. 2 years ago, i gained 5 lbs from binge eating. then during the pandemic, i was home and lost the weight again. i m still losing weight and i ve never been lighter in my life, but i m struggling. i work out every single day and hard sometimes burning 7 calories . in addition to that, i can only get myself to eat about 1 calories a day sometimes 12 but that is rare and i only feel okay with it if i burned a ton of calories from working out that day. during the weekends though, i eat over 12 calories realistically probably about 17 , which should be normal, but after every weekend thay i m not disciplined, i hop on the scale and the number kills me. last night i had a moment, where i ate nachos. they were so good, but i ate all of them, and i started sobbing because i wanted to be disciplined this weekend. i felt terrible. this morning, i woke up thinking to myself that i am done with my poor eating habits and struggling with eating. i m a 21 year old female, and i should be able to consume at least 18 calories a day without feeling terrible about it especially if i m working out at least 5 days a week so i decided: okay. today is the day where i heal my metabolism, and i work to creating a healthier mindset. however, i hopped on the scale tonight before dinner and i had gained 7 pounds from the nachos from the night before, as well as drinking and from eating my hearty meals today. i physically and mentally cannot handle gaining 7 lbs in 2 days and if i continue to eat like this, i m terrified of gaining weight. i feel helpless and have no idea what to do, because now i feel like i need to go back to 1 calories a day but i know my thinking is not healthy. i guess i m just wondering if anyone has any advice thoughts encouragement that they would like to share with me, and if so, i would greatly appreciate it. i just don t know how to get my life back. thank you ",

"this is going to sound weird nsfw. i don t know how to talk about this to anyone or if this is normal for someone with a history of eating disorders. maybe i m looking for validation, maybe i just want to share this with someone because i can t tell anyone i know. i have had disordered eating my whole life. i have always been on a quest to lose weight. after i had my baby a couple of years ago, i was put on a ton of meds for depression that made me gain more weight than i imagined possible. i m finally weaning off them and starting to lose again the healthy way . but to the point of this post, i have always been so obsessed with weight loss and dieting and changing my body, that one of the only things that turns me on is weight loss. i see a before and after picture of a celebrity who has lost weight like adele or rebel wilson for example and i get sooo excited. honestly l masturbate to these pictures. pictures of people i know personally who have lost are even better. guys, girls, it doesn t matter. i am normally a straight female attracted to men. i also get turned on looking at the numbers and seeing how many sizes or how many pounds people have lost.. even if it s me. every pound i lose, every bone that i start to see, i get turned on. i don t know if anyone else has experienced this or if i am a freak. i just feel like i have been obsessed with weight loss and weight and numbers for so long, that it s changed my brain and my wants and desires. i looked into kink and fetish forums to see if anyone like this has been shared but so far can t find anything and that makes me even more self conscious. i am married and would love to be able to share my desires with my husband but i am scared he would judge me. maybe i just need to discuss this in therapy. i don t know. don t want the therapist to judge me either.",
"modeling and eating disorders. hi everyone i m 16 years old and my dream has always been to become a model someday. i ve done some photo shoots never professionally and a lot of the time people ask me if i model, and when i say no, they tell me i should give it a try. since the pandemic, and some other things that happened in my life, i ended up suffering from an eating disorder. i m on recovery now, and i can tell i m getting better. these last days i ve been thinking if i should try to reach out to agencies or not. i think it s not the right time since i don t want to get triggered, and i m afraid of what some people can say to me. i ve read that a lot of agencies don t want people that are suffering had suffered from an eating disorder. is this real? i really want to be a model, but maybe i just can t. thanks in advance, i would really appreciate any response to this : ",
"advice on how to stop binge eating? and actually eat normally . for context, i did restrict in the past, but as i started to recover, my family started to not care if i eat way to much, so now i do this uncontrollably, especially when i'm sad or stressed. but it even happens when i'm happy so i'm going to ask for advice, as there's no way i can see a specialist. how do you stop binge eating alone? what to do when you binge to not make it worse? and i also have a question, can you expand your life span by starting to have good habits especially in eating ? or will i still die soon because of habits of the past? you don't have to necessarily answer this i'm only asking for advice, so of course you don't need to answer this post",
"weird friend situation vent? . my friend has had surgery recently, and has had some complications causing pain with eating. in the past i have told her talking about dieting and weight loss and things along those lines are triggers for me, and she has been talking about the weight she s lost every day for weeks. about how she can t eat and how she plans to eat and then talks herself out of it because of the pain here s the thing though, this has happened 6 months into the worst relapse i ve ever had and for the first time in our lives, me being the same size or smaller than her. she is also taking no steps to see a doctor and get herself looked after as she gets worse my eating disorder is screaming and competitive, but i m also very concerned that she has watched what i ve done; seen how the same thing more or less worked for me for weight loss, and as a result isn t taking her surgical recovery seriously because she seems to be determined to keep dropping the weight. i m concerned i ve triggered something in her too because our entire lives our relationship goes back and forth between supportive and caring, to like weird periods of one upping one another. thats never been this disorder for me, but i think it might be what it is for her unconsciously. i feel awful for thinking that but the timing is bizarre, that suddenly she finds out my weight and thats when her pain suddenly increased so much she straight up couldn t eat. i don t know. my perspective is warped. it just seems interesting that someone who immediately after surgery was drinking milkshakes without issue has deteriorated this quickly and when she saw her surgeon there was no need for immediate follow up?",

"confused on wether i belong here or not. i'm 15, physically female but i'm genderfluid. for some insight, ive been diagnosed with clinical depression and just recently got diagnosed with adhd, i also have extreme bouts of insomnia and an addictive personality. i started having bd when i was around 11, and my obsession with my weight slowly showed itself through the way i tried to cover my entire body with certain clothes, or wore tight things to look thinner. since around the start of quarantine though, it started to manifest itself through my appetite. i began to not let myself eat for hours and hours until eventually i would eat something small before i fell asleep. or i'd drink juice, or water, or some chips, instead of eating a full meal. i'd watch documentaries about weight loss and the journeys of plus sized people through things like gastric bypass or overcoming their own bd, or i'd watch stuff like 'supersize vs superskinny', to sorta persuade myself out of eating. whenever i'm on social media and i see someone who's unnaturally thin via photoshop, i feel this sour ugly thing in my stomach and it makes me anxious. i go days without eating real food and then binge eat a ton of things in one night, only to feel so guilty about it afterwards. whenever i order stuff and try it on, it looks fine, but then when i go out anywhere, i can't bring myself to wear it cause i think i look too big in it. i'm always pinching my skin back or angling my body in the mirror to see how i'd look if i was thinner. i have this ""if i just ignore the hunger pains for a bit this will all go so much easier"" mentality. i get so anxious about my hip dips, or my thighs, or my arms that i feel genuinely sad, and it gets so overwhelming i wanna cry sometimes. what sucks is that i used to love food. i like watching it be made, and i like the descriptions of it, and i like the way it tastes when i've gotten so hungry i can't take it anymore. but i can't stand how i feel after eating, i just feel guilty and lazy and big. i weighed about 14 lbs in 6th grade, i weigh 119 now, and i still keep feeling like i need to lose more. i feel this odd satisfaction when i notice that my waist looks thinner, or i can see some of my ribs, or my thighs look thinner, and it makes me feel giddy. i know it's not supposed to, cause i lost it in an unhealthy way, but i can't help it. it also never lasts, and eventually i just want to keep losing more. i'm scared that eventually i'll lose so much there will be nothing left. i tell myself that i'll start eating healthier once im thin enough, but i feel like that's a lie. maybe it's because of my mental illnesses, cause i also started self harming when i was 11 as well. i just keep denying that i might have an ed, because it feels so overwhelming to have to acknowledge that, and i don't want another issue to add to my already messy mental state. if there's anyone who can give me some advice on this, or could maybe explain if i do have an ed, or i'm just overreacting or something, i would really appreciate it.",
"tw: childhood ed abuse. hey, please if you are not in the right head space do not read the post, i don't want anyone to get triggered this isn't about me, it's about my 9 year old little sister, we live in a very strict middle eastern household, and this little baby gains alot of weight by eating normal amounts, so obviously she isn't over eating yet but, she gets emotionally and physically abused when she is caught eating other than the times that were scheduled for her which is a tiny breakfast, and a couple spoons of lunch and that is it, she will occasionally be allowed to have a chocolate once every two weeks or so recently this has caused her to eat excessively behind the family's back. i am really really concerned about her, i did everything i can to fight the off of her but i was called things like: ""dumb"" ""oblivious"" ""arrogant"" ""look at your self first"" and so on and was also physically abused when i tried to step up for her, so that's obviously not a solution... i don't know what i'm asking for, but i really need to support her, she is crumbling and i don't know how to help",

"please help advise me. hello, friends. i've been suffering with what i believe is obviously some sort of eating disorder that has gotten progressively worse over the past 3 years from when it started. let me start by saying i am a professional chef. i love food. i'm so passionate about it. i love cooking it. i love feeding others....but when it comes down to eating, not just my food but any food anywhere, i struggle. it seems that food just makes feel nauseous. makes me feel sick. i don't get physically sick but it makes it impossible to eat. i eat one or two bites and i am full and miserable and nauseous. it's not certain textures or flavours or smells.. it's all food. i can and have gone up to three days with maybe a piece of toast or something along those lines and that's it. i have consistently lost weight. over 35 pounds in last year. 7 pounds in just the last week. i don't think i'm fat. i know i'm underweight. i want to eat and i know i have to. i just can't. has anyone struggled with this? i am new to ed's and i'm just trying to get an idea what i'm dealing with. i drink shakes when i can to get calories in, but they are too expensive to use constantly. thank you.",
i m kinda worried about my eating disorder. so it s been 2 years that i suffer from an eating disorder and i did a blood test and everything was good but i don t stop to have nausea when i eat a bit and sometimes with no reason i just have a really big naus e and i got thrill and start to shaking,
"i lost weight and just a full rant about my ed. okay for context. i'm at a friend's grandparents house and their house has a scale. i kept eyeing the scale, tempted by it. i finally stepped on and watched the numbers. thoughts raced in my mind. i dont think i lost weight, well i dont look like i did. that sorta've thought. well i finlu peaked at the number's. 2 pounds i lost that much in less then two weeks. i'm so close to my gw, i am excited that i'll finally be pretty and be happy. i wasn't super big on quitting this. but, seeing the weight i lost is fueling continuing this. sometimes i wonder why i do this. but i always snap back into my thinking. i think the worst reason i do this is because i want to be noticed by someone. i know if they found i do this they would be upset and tell my parents. i sometimes don't feel as my reason to doing this is valid. which makes me feel as if i don't deserve to eat. i feel sick by my reasoning, because i want to be pretty and thin and i don't think i deserve it. i tell my friends i haven't hurt myself since i was 12 three years ago well soon to be once i turn 15 this year but i still continue to do harmful things to myself. i cut my knuckles so much they can't be cut anymore. i feel like my ed is just a combination of my depression and self esteem issues. i bottled it up for so long and now it transformed into this.",
"treatment experience?. i've been looking into some treatment stories for people with ed and haven't really found what the thing is that actually helps people recover. on top of that, i've seen heard of plenty plenty of treatment patients that come out and just relapse right away or relapse anyway. are treatment centers just support groups and re feeding teaching people how to eat regularly? that doesn't seem like it's a true method of help seeing as so many relapse after all of this... anyone who's been in treatment have any comments to add or whether it's true or false? experiences? thanks for reading.",
"slowly going downhill with everything rant tw mental health. rant section 1 back story: this past month i m be doing a lot better than normal. my anxiety and tic disorder are reduced. my depression finally feels manageable most days, and my binges have been less frequent. i ve gotten better at forgiving myself after binges and still choosing to fuel my body with food. supposed trigger: my best friend hasn t been at school for a little over two weeks. i called and texted at least 4 times a day, to get no answer. she finally called me back on friday and said she was just diagnosed with depression, and is having a depressive episode. she said she is having suicidal thoughts and to not tell anyone, she never talks about her feelings so this was quite alarming. on saturday i hung out with her the whole day and she said she felt okay for the first time in a couple weeks. i m glad to help in any minor way possible. present: however, since being told this news i find my acid reflux is flaring up from even broth. and my tic disorder is worsening again, along with my anxiety. i m tired everyday and don t have the energy to cook. i m not eating enough, as i m barely able to eat anything. i feel physically sick when i look at food and i don t know what t do. i cant focus well in class and i spend the day thinking about my best friend and calories. i m cold all the time again, and feel dizzy more often than usual i have vertigo . i honestly didn t think it was stressing me out that much, at least consciously. i think i m handling it well, especially having gone through similar myself. but.. seeing as that s the only thing that changed in the past couple days it s likely the cause. perhaps even worse the urge to binge is gone completely. although binging isn t great, overall in my week i would have enough calories when i did.",
hunger cues. does anyone else have difficulty understanding hunger cues telling if you re actually hungry? i convince myself i want food and am not actually hungry. my brain will also not be hungry but my body will be. i feel like i have no sense of what my body wants needs and when.,

"how to find joy outside of food?. first a little bit of backstory context: my ed started when i was 23, which is kinda unusual i know. i used to have some disordered tendencies throughout my teenage years. but never to a worrying amount . i am now 25 student and in therapy for officially anorexia nervosa. which is well not that helpful but that might be another post worth but i am trying my best to still keep the weight gain going. my ed was never about weight or locking thin, i think that is a bit more common in adult ed . for me it was always more about being in control, proving to myself that i am strong, because i can keep doing x amount of steps, fasting for x amount of time etc. just keeping up with all the rules that i set for myself. i am basically not the typical 16 year old emaciate girl that cries over eating a piece of chocolate i avoid certain food, but if i am around people i eat completely normal . amp;gt; if you are here for the question: i am not scared of food. actually it s the opposite. food is the only thing that i can think about once i get up. it s sad, but it is the highlight of my day. i can t wait for the moment that i am finally eating and once i eat there is no stopping. i basically eat for an hour until i feel completely stuffed. going sometimes 5 6 times in the kitchen to get more. and afterward i get nothing done for the rest of the day anymore. so far that i schedule my work until i eat so that i can at least get the most important task out of the way. every time that something good bad happens i reward compensate by over eating. especially food that i don t usually allow myself call it extreme hunger binge eating . and i am tired of that. i just want my day to revolve on something else rather than food or going food shopping which i basically do everyday. as it again is an immense highlight for me. i want to find other things to celebrate with compensate with. what are your tips? what do you do?",
"rant. so i was restricting abusing laxatives for a year or so i am doing much better now i have thoughts about it a lot still but have not relapsed. i have actually gained some weight back that now it almost seems impossible that i had went without solid food for so long. the thing i want to rant and vent about though is that everyone complimented me when i was at my lowest hardly hanging on. hadn t touched a piece of food for a week and guzzling down laxatives.. everyone said how good i looked. everyone mentioned my weight loss. my parents who knew i was not eating didn t say much other then just eat something. but strangers and friends they all were so happy for me. and now that i am healthy and eat, but maybe look bigger. no one says anything. no one says good job eating today. good job loving yourself the way you are. everyone just goes about their days completely unaware of how hard it is to look this way but finally feel healthy on the inside. no one warned me that once i was better everyone would stop complementing me and thinking how i must work out all the time, i must be so healthy. when in reality i am healthy now. that s all just needed to feel heard. hope everyone eats today.

"vent i think ive relapsed and i dont know what to do next.. tw: relapse, restricting, starving, calorie counting, weight loss, body image, intrusive thoughts. dont read this if you struggle with any of the things above. but if you feel comfortable with it i really need some advice. hi, im 17 and ive stuggled with eating, more specifically anorexia, for about half a year now, though ive been ""recovering"" for the past nearly two months. my friend found out and told my parents, they started getting suspicious about everything i was forced to eat more than i used to. which is great for starting your recovery and living a healthier life and all, but.. i dont think i was ready for recovery. i know i know, i probably would never have been ready, but still i havent managed to get rid of any of my mindsets that i had while actively struggling with my ed. i thought i did for a while, because i distracted myself a lot or made myself feel better about eating by making healthier, high protein meals, but the bad mindset has been creeping back in. even worse, my parents have basically forgotten about this whole thing because its been a while since weve talked about it, and they have stopped asking me if ive eaten enough etc. so now im just in this weird place i dont want to be miserable again. i dont want to have to lie to the people i love and feel awful and guilty and hungry and weak all the time. i dont want to miss out on more delicious food just to eat one small portion of the same thing every a day. i dont want food to take over my mind again. but.. i still cannot get the thought of losing even more weight out of my head. at least now i can recognize the damage ive done so far that i had been oblivious to previously i look way skinnier than before, and i recently realized that ive lost very roughly 1 8 of my body weight during all this time. which is bad. weirdly enough though, ""thanks"" to the weight that i have lost, i dont really.. dislike my body anymore. im actually pretty okay with how clothes look on me etc and i dont really want to be super thin and underweight anymore, especially not enough for people around me to notice worry about. so i really dont know why i still feel such a strong need to become even skinnier. i havent gained any weight back throughout my recovery, but i havent lost any either which is obviously the point of recovering my weight has been stagnant. and i really, really hate the thought of not constantly losing weight anymore. its not enough. i am nearly on the cusp of being underweight and it is so incredibly tempting just to keep going. i want to lose more weight, the people around me have stopped caring again, i have every opportunity to fully relapse into my ed. and i know i need to find a way to stop this from happening but its hard to even start somewhere when my mindset apparently hasnt changed a bit. i downloaded my old calorie tracker again today, which i planned to never do, but i wanted to know how guilty i ""should"" be feeling about my eating. i logged all the food i ate today, which is probably around my daily average at the moment, and it was just over my old calorie limit that i used to eat maybe half of. i havent felt this gross in a long long time, i still feel incredibly sick just thinking about that number. im sure ive gone over the limit a bunch of times recently, and i hate hate hate that thought. i dont know if i can keep eating like this for even a day from now on, i just want to starve myself again forever and ever. i cant handle recovery. i dont know how to stop myself from relapsing anymore, i feel so awful eating normally, i just want to go back. please help me. i dont know what to do at this point. i never thought it would get bad again, i thought it was just a phase and i was over it and it would be easy because ""i was never really sick in the first place"". maybe was wrong. please, if you have any advice, or experiences stories to share, or just words of encouragement, leave a comment. i am helpless. sorry for this mess of a text wall, thank you so much for reading.",
"tired of my ed.. tw ed amp; x2 b; im really tired tbh. when will people realize eating disorders are not a trivial thing and it affects every aspect of our daily life? it's hard to get out of bed, it's hard to function normally and it's hard to even just breathe. i can't even look at food properly. i cant smell it or even hear about it. it makes me sick. but nobody seems to get it. it affects me so deeply hinders every aspect of my life. i'm slacking of at work and school and life at home is terrible. my parents don t believe in my ed. every time i skip a meal i have to hear an earful from them. it is so tiring and painful. to be reminded of the one thing i am trying to avoid. i need help not rebuke. they don t get it. they keep telling me i am a horrible person for lying to them about eating and they just do not seem to understand why i lie. its because im mentally crippled. its easy to just not talk about it by saying ""yeah i ate."" that makes a cycle of constant pain and exhaustion so much easier. itd be fine if they did it because they care about me, but that's not why they do it. they do it because they need to be a perfect child for them and do all the work and because me lying apparently makes them feel like they're bad parents. they keep, making it about themselves. when its my body, my feelings, my pain. my friends often do the same. they don't like how im dishonest and get weird about food and talk about how it's affecting them and makes them feel bad or guilty, always in a very condescending way. life is so hard to navigate as it is, and they make it harder. so inhumane. these people do not get that my ed is mine, and it is very serious, its a disorder and it affects me deeply. its very painful and they don't have a right to make me feel guilty for trying to make it easier for myself. they don't have the right to make it harder for me by making it about themselves. anyone who does that to someone with a disorder is a truly horrible person. imagine if someone you know has cancer which is you know cancer and they forget to take medication one time and instead of trying to help them out, or minding your own business you choose to manipulate them and tell them that you're a terrible person, how dare you miss your medicines? my grandma died after forgetting to take meds, i have so much trauma, why would you do that to me? fuck you. how's that sound? not so good, right? when someone is on their death bed and you make it about yourself? i wish people understood this. how much does it take to be kinder to people in pain?

what is going to happen. ok so i really don't know what to do. i have been struggling and i'm at a really low bmi but idk if i can hide this anymore. i'm going to my therapist on tuesday who is a dietitian and psychotherapist i go to for my gender dysphoria but i think she also works in ed's and if i'm honest about my ed idk what will happen.. i don't know what will happen if i hide it and need to get weighed at the doctor either i just don't know what to expect,

"bed i feel like an amazing actress, nobody knows my struggle and i m getting congratulations on weight loss. tw. im obese, and have been since i was 7 years old. i thought that if i finally lost weight, that my habits of bingeing and restricting would disappear. i m on a pharmacy issued program, where they put you on basically lt; 85 calories gt; a day. they provide every type of supplement, so supposedly it s okay. they don t allow people with eds to do the program because of that. of course, i m not diagnosed, because my parents don t want me to be diagnosed with anything. i m been doing this lt; diet gt; for 3 months and have lost a healthy amount of weight. yet, still i continue to binge and restrict. before when i keep gaining weight i did the same thing. i m doing the same crap but have just flipped the balance of lt; calories in vs calories out gt;. since i m losing a safe amount of weight per week, i m being congratulated, by my mom, and other family members. i m still struggling, but now i m almost in the overweight category instead. i feel like such an actress, and such a fake person, because i either lie and say i already ate all my meals on restrictive days , or i lie and say i just didn t throw away wrappers from earlier when i m caught red handed in a binge. i eat till i m about to puke, can hardly breathe and my acid reflux is making stomach acid come up my throat. then because of how guilty and sick i feel, i m scared to eat for a few days. it s just so crazy to me that no one knows, i ve had food issues since age 7, now i m almost 18, and no one has noticed. i go to a psychologist for a tic disorder and anxiety issues. she was the only one i told about my binges, but now i m lying to her too only about food, not anything else . she even congratulated me on my weight loss, because i lied and said my relationship with food is better. extreme tw there is this part of my brain saying that lt; if i can just become underweight, if i can become anorexic instead of being an obese binge eater, people will believe in my struggle, and not think that i just was just an overweight pig, wanting an excuse gt;.",
"question i eat less instead of more when watching tv netflix doing anything else really. what can i do?. this may sound dumb and for that matter weird. but it is what it is. i find myself often in a situation where if i'm watching something, anything really, then i'll inevitably end up focusing more on that than remembering that i have food i must finish. this results in me taking excruciatingly long to finish my food and in turn makes me really fatigued and bored of eating it because it's taking so long. this sounds like a dream for people who want to lose weight. but even though i'm healthy and working on getting my abs eating 'properly' and on time is a major issue for me. if i do nothing while eating then i end up finishing the food very quickly. 1. why is this? why does my brain enjoy tv youtube and other stimuli more than food to the point where i forget to eat and thus eat less as compared to other people who end up eating more when watching tv netflix? 2. what other actions can i take besides just eating without another stimulus? sometimes schedules mean i need to look at other things including work, and i end up focusing on that much more and leaving the food for later.",

"i ate baby food until i was 11 years old and it almost killed me.. when you re a baby, you learn how to chew food. it s like breathing, you just kind of do it. i was never taught to chew food. my parents would try to give me solid food, but i d throw a fit and cry. so i just ate baby food, only two different types because i was picky and wouldn t eat anything else: strawberry banana and i think an orange flavor. i only ate baby food and drank milk literally nothing else until i was 11. i had to hide it from everyone. i d lock myself in a room to eat when guests were over, i couldn t go to friends houses for long, i couldn t sleep over anywhere, i couldn t eat at school, i hid a lot to eat and missed out on a lot as a kid because of it. oddly enough, i was a super physically healthy kid. i was quite skinny, but i didn t get sick or hurt much. skip to the middle end of fifth grade, i was 11 years old. the baby food finally caught up to me and my body began to reject it. anytime i ate it, i immediately threw it up. drinking milk was ok but it would come up with the baby food when i d attempt to eat it. this went on for a month to a month and a half. i was deathly ill, like i genuinely thought every single day that i was going to die eventually from it. i was in and out of school for that entire time and missed a total of 2ish weeks. when i would go to school, i d have to sit in the back of the classroom with a pillow and a blanket and try to sleep and relax because my teacher noticed and felt bad. my family doesn t really trust doctors so i never went to see one, but i told my school that i did because how do you tell them that you didn t? they asked me everyday for a doctors note but i never brought one, luckily that was my last year at that school and there was only a couple months left. anyway, one day i went to mcdonald s with my mom and sister and i decided to try my first solid food which was their french fries. i was instantly hooked. i stopped eating baby food and i became addicted to mcdonald s french fries. i always say that if it wasn t for me drinking milk for my entire childhood, i may not have gotten as far as i did. deada i swear by milk for saving me to this day. this eating habit still affects me to this day. once i find a food that i really like, that s all i wanna eat and i get addicted to it. i was addicted to mcdonald s french fries until i was 16 17 years old. i found friends who helped me try new things. i m 22 now and i ve branched out and i eat different things now, but not like a normal person. i eat the same 9ish things daily and i still fear trying new things but i m much farther than i was. i m much healthier now but i still have a very very long way to go as i m not where i d like to be at all and i m still not fully recovered from it all considering the baby food stuff took up literally half of my life. chewing is still something i struggle with too so certain foods and i don t get along because of it. i take forever to chew meat, like literally forever and i m always the last to finish my food when i go out to eat. i ve been shamed and made fun of for it many times so it does make it harder to progress. i want to leave off with a question. is this something that anyone can relate to? if so, i d love to hear about it as i have always felt like i m the only one who s went through something like that and it s made it worse on me. not that i wish this on anyone else, but it helps knowing that you re not alone.",

"hospital visit nothing serious but still a little scary. main reason that s still affecting me now a couple days after my short hospital stay is kidney infection but that as far as i know can t be brought up by an ed. however i was also hospitalized with very low iron, like i was shaking uncontrollably and freezing cold despite it being a hot summer this year. so basically what i m saying is please keep an eye on your iron and get some iron supplements, it was really scary when i started shaking and feeling cold to the touch. i couldn t feel my fingers or toes either i really thought i was gonna die or something. so short psa: if you re currently restricting please keep an eye on your iron and take iron tablets and obviously all your other vitamins",

"partner is trying to be supportive with backhanded comments but it's not it. my partner told me last week that he doesn't like how i look now and that he thinks my bones are disgusting. it made me realize how differently we view bodies and it made me feel kinda iffy. i am at bmi 21 rn and while i am currently still engaging in some unhealthy habits, i am eliminating them and plan to stay around this weight in the future with healthy eating and exercise. knowing that he would much rather see me at bmi 27 or whatever my bmi was before is very discouraging, it makes me feel like i can't recover while still keeping my body at the weight that makes me comfortable, as if recovering automatically meant i gotta be in the thighs chaffing constantly out of breath body. maybe it's my ed speaking, but i genuinely felt really uncomfortable in my body at higher bmi and i don't think recovering will change that. i just want to settle on comfortable weight. hearing from your partner that he finds your body disgusting is generally really uncomfortable experience, although i think he meant well and tried to convince me that i don't have to keep this body with unhealthy behaviour, but he's really a bit dense if he thinks this will work. on more positive note, i managed to keep up with my schedule this weekend no binging, no undereating. things are really looking up ",

"i'm lost in the inpatient program.. i've been in my first inpatient program now for 12 days. it is a government funded program where i live. i have so many concerns on my mind and i was hoping for some feedback or guidance. firstly we are on the general psych ward. which means there is 49 general psych patients and 6 of us. this is beyond scary as there are criminals, perverts and many others with psychiatric disorders who wonder in our rooms and steal our belongings. happy they are here for help but why have we been tossed in the same ward? as most of you know our ed's are result of trauma. once i arrived i was told there is no trauma therapy in the program. this program only interrupts our symptoms and neutralizes our relationship with food. i dont know how i'm supposed to leave here with a mountain of trauma still on my plate. they have also taken away the body image program as well. not all of my peers but most struggle with this as well. great, the two things which are the root of my ed won't be addressed, what's the point ot being here. i thought we would be supervised after each meal or kept together so it would be more difficult to act on our symptoms. nope we eat and everyone goes there separate ways. making it very easy to hide our symptoms and act upon them. i'm also type 1 diabetic and we are forced to challenge cafe desserts each week. this means a piece of triple chocolate fudge pecan cake, or a slice of pie and an enormous butter tart have to be eaten at a meal. i've been told that i have no choice to eat it, even if my sugar reads 15 or above. i've tried to explain to them that this is going to put my body in danger. they have responded by saying they will make sure i have extra insulin available when that day comes. wtf?? when i leave here i will still be a t1d and never eat 3 to 5 grams of sugar if my blood sugar reads over 1 . they have told me to put my diabetes on the back burner for now as i'm here for my ed. we are also in full lockdown as there is a covid outbreak on our floor. they aren't testing patients before they are brought to the ward. thankfully we have all tested negative but the general psych patients are testing positive as they wonder the halls all day and most won't wear their masks. there are a bunch who are anti vaxers and making it so hard on the nurses. we have been confined to our rooms for 3 days now and they said possibly 1 in total. i'm already sliding into a deeper depression as there is only so much tv and reading i can do, i don't nap which leaves me alone with my thoughts making my day incredibly stressful. not being able to just walk our normal eating area and eating in our beds makes horrible thoughts race through my mind. what i'm eating and not having any type of movement afterwards makes me immediately think weight gain. there is no activity to counter the food we are eating. i hope all you strong ladies and gentlemen get the help you deserve. i'm sorry for the rant i'm struggling right now.",

"feel like im stuck in a stupid binge restrict cycle again need support? idk. tw: mention of purg ng stuck in the lovely old binge restrict cycle again amp; im determined too break out of this quicker than last time. i dont even think i feel that much guilt for what i ate tonight after restricting in the day, just uncomfortable and automatically going back too planning my restriction. but i dont want too do that because ik ill just 'binge' tomorrow again. i feel disgusting amp; so full but i didn't really eat that much. i don't feel much food guilt but i feel guilty for not feeling guilt if that makes sense. ironic isnt it is there any benefits at all to eating more than your used to or more than you probably need. ive been trying to stop purg ng for about three days and already failed twice : idk. never ending ugh.",
"my family affects my eating problems ? . hello, i d like to provide some context before stating the basic issue, i m 19, female, and am 5 1 tall. i ve not been in a very healthy relationship with family for most of my childhood and into my teenage years, some abusive tendencies from parents, for a brief time i was in foster care, and later in highschool i was sent away from home for months to live in a youth shelter because of the daily arguments with my narcissistic parents and constant degrading that drove me out of sociopathic tendencies into meltdowns or tantrums as they called it. seeking therapy never helped, as my mom would use the opportunities to drag me through the mud and make herself seem like a victim in front of my therapists who would end up agreeing with her and verbally berate me and belittle me. i was only a kid. a teenager. i still cry so much over those times. and i m now a young adult diagnosed with anxiety disorder and add they keep trying to give me antidepressants and adhd meds but they literally did not help , obsessive tendencies emotionally, physically, and mentally , and lately have been just so incredibly sad. my weight keeps fluctuating, i was 16 early in highschool, dropped to 135 junior year, and then plateaued at 15 for the longest until i turned 18, and since then i ve moved in with my older sibling and her binge eating habits plus quarantine have made me lapse into binging. i restricted and exercised often back then, one meal a day was my biggest focus, and i would hoard junk food just to throw it out. now i am 18 lbs, trying to purge and my body won t let me, restricting is looming over me, what can i do to break this cycle? how do i stop binging and will restricting help me gain my previous sense of control and peace of mind back? i feel so lost without the same control i had back then.",
"am i a fatphobic c nt?. back story about myself, like i ve dealt with a mother who supported the whole 9 s diet culture, heroine chic, telling me once as a pre teen that i should be less than 1 pounds which is insane. i personally in my early to late teen years was apart of pro a a communities on tumblr etc, i used to binge, starve, fast, diet, work out until i passed in exhaustion. i m older now, i m wiser now, i eat to satisfy myself, i work out inconsistently but, i don t put pressure on myself to reach some sort of goal weight like i used too. to doctors and the bmi scale i would be considered overweight for my height, but i don t really care. i try to say away from the scale because it might trigger me to relapse. my current problem is now, i have friends who are larger than me both in height and weight and i just observe what they eat and to me it s a lot. i know that people eat different amount to sustain their body types but sometimes they makes comments on what i eat and they like you eat so little you eat like a pigeon baby but if i commented on their weight eating habits i m very much sure that they would take offense to it. like sometimes we will be eating together and i go for seconds and there s nothing left because they ve eaten it all, it just gives me this sense of frustration because i m finally at a place where i want to eat, i want to get a second plate and i m dealt with fat fucks who eat up everything, and it lowkey kinda makes me want to relapse back to the time when all i had was water for breakfast, lunch and dinner. like is this stemming from dealing with food scarcity as a child, because i grew up poor and never felt like i had enough. am i just projecting my ideals of body standards onto others based on my own insecurities? am i just a fatphobic bitch? i know that fatphobia is wrong, that people eat for their own body types but i can t help but think wow, you eat a lot and i find myself mildly disgusted and angry even though i know i shouldn t feel this way. please help.",
"a little bit about my ed. i started gaining weight when i was 15, since then only thing that s on my mind is to lose weight. i stopped playing sports cause my friend were smaller than me. i was insecure about my body all the time. i stopped hanging out with people as much as possible. my friends and relatives used to tell me how i look so much mature for my age. and there were guys in their late 2 s or early 3 s hitting on me. at that time i didn t know it was possible to lose weight cause i had never seen anyone go from being fat to skinny in real life. i started getting depressed and turned into foods for my happiness. i started binging every single day with no physical activity what so ever. i stopped studying. i went from being a grade student to failing my exams. i was gaining more and more weight without even realizing it. after 2 years, i decided to diet and workout and finally lose weight. i started waking up at 4am just to workout and i was following every diet i saw on youtube but every diet ended up with a very bad binge. instead of losing weight, i ended up gaining some extra. every night i used to look at my pictures from when i was skinny and cry about how i let myself go. there wasn t a day where suicide didn t cross my mind. i also found out i had hypothyroidism. so then one day, one of my cousin told me how i hated the idea of eating when i was in middle school and was literally built like a twig. that made me think if i force myself to hate food again like i did in middle school and don t eat, i ll lose weight. so i started starving myself and the more i restricted the more i started getting obsessed with food. then again this whole cycle of not eating for days then binging for weeks started. i struggled with this for 2 years and my weight was fluctuating so much. i was 148lbs and 122lbs in the same month. and talking about my life in general, it was miserable. i used to skip school all the time. i hated everyone but mostly myself. i had no hobbies and only talked to strangers online. and talking about my education i have no idea what did i study after middle school. my brain was never there. i used to daydream all the time and just recently found out it s a mental illness called maladaptive daydreaming. anyway, after my binge session started getting out of hand i started purging. i was bulimic for 2 months. i used to restrict as much as possible then purge when ever i did eat. i was purging every single day for 2 months from 1 6 times per day. and after that i couldn t physically continue purging because everytime i tried to, it felt like my organs were gonna come out of my throat. my stomach was bloated all the time and my face was all swollen which made me feel more fat even tho my weight was dropping. all this time i was bulimic, i was weightlifting at the gym. later on, i decided to eat healthy, eat more protein and lift more heavy. after 2 months i had only lost 5lbs and looked the same which drew me back to ed. no matter how much i try even the tiniest thing trigger me to go back to my unhealthy habits. i can never see myself getting smaller than this. it just feels impossible. i m gonna be 2 next month and i m taking this illness with me even in my 2 s.",
"first time hospital appointment nerves. hi, i ve recently been referred to an out patient eating disorder service at a hospital after some doctors appointments and assessments from the primary care team. i guess i m just nervous and unsure about what to expect. i want to get better but i m not sure i want it enough or that i m in a good enough place mentally to be able to deal with the stress of having to keep up with appointments specifically to talk about weight and food i feel like maybe if anything that will just encourage the bad behaviours. i m also nervous that they ll weigh me i guess they kind of have to. but i m more nervous about them saying everything is fine because i m just on the cusp on being underweight by around 3 pounds but healthy by bmi standards. a large part of me does want to get better but being told i m healthy and everything s fine will just set me back so much because it s taken a long time to be taken seriously by the system for my mental health. i just feel like a lot of the questions they might ask i ll likely be really indecisive and torn because as much as i m fighting it and pushing myself to get help i do feel good when i manage to restrict to the level i want to so i guess i m just in two minds. if anybody has any experiences especially in the uk of talking to ed specialists and kind of how they work i d appreciate it. specifically how do the doctors deal with a person who is i guess on the fence about getting better. probably not the best way to phrase it but i hope that makes sense. this was kind of equally me asking for advice but also ranting sorry about that. i ve not included many details about my specifics and don t have an official diagnosis but the closest fit would be anorexia apart from the bmi but that s not extremely reliable as we all probably know ",

"how to not give up on recovery???. i ve been in recovery for three years from anorexia and now i ve seriously relapsed. bulimic behaviors came back which had been latent for many years. i ve been eating disordered forever and i just want to learn how to live without this. i m realizing i may never fully recover as this has been a mental condition that developed when i was very young. i m so close to giving up on my recovery. it s brutal and after three years, some things have gotten better but really it s my eating disorder cycling through symptoms and behaviors. i try and try to recover but my eating disorder is here to stay. it s so hard to wake up and choose recovery every day when i have this monstrous disorder anyway. i have goals in my life that i want to pursue but it feels like the only way to really eradicate my eating disorder is to kill myself. i won t kill myself but when i think about having to live my whole life with this bullshit, it s so tempting. i want to recover. i really want to recover but i m starting to question if that s even possible. thanks for letting me vent. what can we do to curb this feeling of recovery defeat? how do we stay working toward a recovery that might not even happen? how do we keep fighting this? i hope this doesn t discourage anyone from trying to recover because you can absolutely get better. i m rooting for recovery still for all of us. just feeling extremely discouraged",
"my daughter was recently diagnoses with anorexia. please advise me how i can be the best, most supportive dad for her.. my 18 year old daughter lives with her mom was recently diagnosed. she has gone through profound stressors in the past six months a complicated tonsillectomy, slow death of her stepfather, first year of college and hid this from her mother and i, mostly to protect her mother from additional stress while her husband succumbed to a terminal illness. i knew she was losing weight but it was so gradual that i did not realize it was a problem until recently. mom is sort of emotionally frazzled, understandably so, so i need to step up even more. i would appreciate hearing from younger women how they would have liked their dads to support them. what is helpful to hear? what is not helpful to hear? what should i do and not do? i really appreciate your insight. daughter is going to enter a partial hospitalization treatment program soon, but i will be around for her as much as i can. thank you.",
torn between wanting too try at life or sink deeper into ed before trying too recover. i feel like part of me is ready too move on if you will. try and improve myself and my life and engage and try at life again. ive felt like this for a little while but am still scared too lean into the idea and really give 'recovery' or something like it a proper go. all ive been doing since xmas is trying too restrict and 'failing'. my mind feels split af. im changing my mind from one extreme too the next. for instance i just spent two hours researching what would be an extremely restrictive diet and planning how ill start it too all of a sudden thinking maybe big big maybe im kinda sorta ready too recover ? i dont feel at this particular moment im using restriction too numb my emotions or as a choping mechanism i think right now my main reason for continuing restriction and clinging too my ed is so that i can reach my lower weight and then feel 'readier' too recover. as it will also be more physical. since also im eating around maintence daily even tbkigh i attempt too eat xxx and fail. its like my body is just rejecting restriction again. but im still being vegan??? idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best,
"i fainted today, what's the best course of an action?. so, little context: i have bulimia, i am at healthy bmi but dropped significant amount of weight in last few months and i am probably severely restricting too i am not a good judge od that. this morning, i had b p session and fainted afterwards. i did hit my head, but just decided to stay home from work and recover a little bit. i don't think i have a concussion. i ate what i could and it's been 1 hours my head is still spinning a lot when i get up and i am a bit dizzy, i have a brain fog and my legs feel weak. my bf talked me into going to visit my doc tomorrow. she has ""sick hours"" for patients that are currently in sick state, and i'll be visiting her as a sick patient, along with people who have, like, flu or elevated temperature. i don't know how i should approach my gp tomorrow. is it even ok for me to come without making an appointment? should i ask her for a blood panel test? should i just ask her for a sick leave for few days so i can stay at home and rest? how should i adress my bulimia without it sounding weird? i have psychiatrist but the soonest he can see me is next week. i am also scheduled for daily ed recovery program, but it starts next month. did anyone go through something similar? i am scared that i am gonna faint again when i am home alone and hit my head more or something. i am just not sure how my doctor can help me in this situation. update: i ended up honestly telling her what happened, she totally blew me off and told me this is matter for my psychiatrist and not her. even refused to sign my sick leave documentation for past two days, despite the fact that i stayed home due to fainting, which is physical condition, not mental. i really do feel betrayed at this point.",

"having a hard time.. i've had a messy battle with eating disorders since i was 12. it comes amp; goes. when things are good, i feel blessed. when things are bad, the first thing i do is take it out on my body. blaming my shitty experiences on my figure. it can be something small too. like a boy not texting me back. or my mom being upset with me for not doing dishes. i recently hit six months of not binging amp; purging, didn't share it with anybody but i was really proud of myself. recently turned 24. it's been a hard couple weeks. everybody got in to a fight at my birthday. even though i know it was the alcohol amp; it had absolutely nothing to do with me i still chose to blame myself amp; my body. it's some weird trigger. idk if it's my anxiety or if it's me constantly wanting to change myself for a better life. i recently relapsed. just once tho. it's been difficult to eat since. i'm so nervous about freaking myself out about my weight again. i've never really openly talked about my journey with eating disorders amp; i'm not sure where to turn to. everybody who knows i skip meals say the same thing, ""you look great, your thin enough."" they don't understand it's more of a behavoiral thing. it's nasty habit. i quit smoking cigarettes easier than anorexia amp; bulimia.",

"do you think that ur ed could be simplified into one thing?. do you think although its different for evryone ofc that ur ed could be simplified into one thing mainly restrictive im talking about with this example ? like i think i just tried too kinda sum up why i restrict into a sentence and i wonder if that at its core that is what a restrictive ed is. for me at least. i dont mean this sums it up for everyone. for instance i kinda knew the answer but i wanted too see what google results came up with when i typed in ""whats it called when you dont want too eat because youll feel too much"" and ofc an came up as a top result. and ik that eds are complex mental illnesses but when we invalidate ourselves over little things i feel like this gives me perspective because sometimes i feel like having an ed can come down too a 'simple?' thing. like not wanting too eat because you wont be able too numb ur emotions. idk if this is making sense. using that example like what other reason could that result in besides from an ed. thats surely not a normal thinking pattern or that of a dieter. is this making sense? thanks for reading lol i hope this kinda made sense.",
"venting ranting ab what's happening to me i guess. first thing is that i am a 16 year old male. for like the past year and a half i only ate one full meal a day and some snacks throughout. for most of that i felt well. then maybe about 3 months ago i saw an old pic of myself from maybe when i was 8 1 . at that time i was a little bit chubby, might not even be considered ""fat"". never the less since i saw that pic i have been eating once a day and only drinking water and doing workouts. some days i feel fine other days i dont. i dont know if i have a disorder or not and i probably should see a doctor but the only way i could go is if i tell my parents and i cannot bring myself to do that. ill try to explain how i feel when it comes to eating. i know that i wont get fat from eating right but that doesnt stop me from not eating because a part of me still feels like i will. but like i just said i know i wont. something just stops me from eating. the mental effects of this have been bad so far because at times i feel like i am going crazy. i decided to make this post at this current moment because i am very hungry right now but i am not going to eat. yes, i know i need to but i just cant lol. my stomach feels so off and i feel like i have to throw up. and i know its because i need to eat. but yet some part of my brain tells me no. thats why i feel like im crazy lol. im telling my body that it cant get something it needs. that is just so sad to me. so yeah this was just me saying stuff ab what im going through.",

priory referral from nhs. i have chronic ocd and an eating disorder. at this stage i believe being an inpatient somewhere is the best thing for my right now. the nhs initially told me that there was a 1 years wait for any treatment from a therapist. has anyone has success with their gp making a referral to the priory?,
"advice please . hi everyone, i've come here to try and get some advice on how to deal with my roommate. as someone who's been dealing with eating disorders my entire adolescence, i can spot the signs a mile away, and my roommate is very, very obviously struggling with an ed. she weighs her food, notes it all down in myfitnesspal, uses her treadmill 24 7, and talks about her body feeling bloated, fat, etc constantly. i've tried to talk about it with her a few times now and each time she just flatly denies that there's any sort of issue at all, and obviously with eds it's not something i want to push because i know exactly how stressful that can be. the trouble is that it's been so long since i was in the stage of my ed where i was in denial that i just can't remember how i would want someone to bring this up with me. that, and the fact that all of this has been immensely triggering to me. like seriously triggering. before moving in here i'd gotten to the point where it wasn't something i was thinking about every day, but now i no longer have that luxury. i'm starting to worry that i might have to move out, which is obviously super annoying and sad. i've managed to persuade her to go to therapy, but the only thing she's told the therapist she needs help with is anxiety. should i tell her i think she needs to tell her therapist about the ed? i think that's the most important part of this getting her to confront her issues with someone who knows what they're talking about. orrrrr, i could email her new therapist directly and tell her all the stuff i know my roommate won't bring up but needs to be addressed. that's sneaky i know but i worry that if i don't she's just going to sit on these problems and they're gonna end up taking me down with her.",
"is this an eating disorder? : tw diet,weight, restricting, health issues, mental health. hi everyone this might be a bit long so please bear with me, i 25f don't really post anything or engage online much so i apologise if this is all over the place or poorly written. i have had self esteem issues most of my life but i turned all the focus to my body when i was about 18 after being in a bit of a turbulent relationship where id get a lot of weight and body related comments. this is where it turned into full blown body dysmorphia and i began restricting my diet. i have tried a couple fad diets and workout routines but nothing every really stuck but i kept eating smaller portions and now i struggle to exercise due to dizziness light headedness and weakness. im about 5""3 and at my heaviest i was probably 67kg and a size 12 last i checked i am now 53.5kg and i am very happy with the loss but still feel huge, partly because i bloat after i eat or drink anything but also because i don't feel like ive made much ""progress"" i guess? i dont think ive lost much weight and i thought i was eating a pretty normal amount of food. i think on a day where im going out or exercising bike ill eat maybe 4 5 kj and if im just sitting at home or not moving around much maybe 3 4 kj but then i have days where ill just eat a muesli bar and soup or something for dinner because im not that hungry. i do feel guilty if i overeat and i tend to make up for that by not eating a lot the next day and or going off the food i ate too much of for a few months. i dont feel hungry much these days and struggle to finish a meal in one sitting because i feel painfully fully after a few mouthfuls. when i do feel hungry its normally when im starving and i need to eat ""right now"" otherwise i get really dizzy and shaky and have palpitations. i guess the reason im asking this is because ive been having quite bad health issues the past 5 years that seem to be getting progressively worse, it never occurred to me that it could be diet related. ive had many tests done and seen a few different doctors. im pretty much always fatigued and before i started taking vyvanse for adhd i would just fall asleep everywhere, brain fog that gets so bad i can't remember the words for some things and i cant read and retain information or focus on a task, dizziness when moving around mostly when bending over and standing up , exercise intolerance shortness of breath,heart palpitations, dizziness, nausea, cant catch my breath , digestive problems, weird cough thing when i get heart palpitations, heat cold intolerance, mineral vitamin deficiencies, low ferritin, eyesight has been getting worse the past few years and seem to keep needing a stronger perscription, random aches and pains and numbness tingling burning areas that move around my body, panic attacks have started happening quite recently and now trouble with short term memory in the past few months but idk if that's just stress. sorry if this is a lot im just not sure who to talk to or if i even should, i just dont feel like im underweight or anything like that. i feel guilty for feeling like i might have an issue when im not really skinny or super sick or anything but im not sure if thats just negative self talk. if you made it this far thank you so much for reading everyone and have a great day ",

"married, but no sex yet ed could be a reason . is it bad that my wife and i haven t had sex yet even though we ve been married since june 2 21? there s a lot that goes into this. we re both virgins. i ve had 4 relationships and a few sexual experiences that never led to sex due to my christian beliefs. but i know how i get turned on, how to please myself and the way that i ve coped with not having sex up until now was through masturbation whenever i get too horny from sleeping next to her and cuddling her every night. for her, i m her first boyfriend and now husband and she s never had experience pleasuring herself before marrying me and doesn t know a lot about how to turn herself on or allow someone to turn her on. on top of this, we re both black, but her mom raised her to only like people that aren t black. also, she s a gym rat and is kind of ocd and is a control freak over food and compulsive exercise. she grew up really really insecure about her body due to some childhood trauma caused by her mother who has eating disorder tendencies and borderline personality disorder issues that she then passed on to my wife mainly the eating disorder tendencies including a love hate relationship with food, her body, and exercise . she also doesn t feel comfortable being touched near her vaginal area and tenses up whenever my hand gets close. we ve tried letting her lead my hand, but the problem is we re both busy a lot and when we get downtime and can cuddle and kiss, she usually doesn t want to kiss, and likes to be on a specific schedule where she might decide to get on her computer and learn coding techniques after we eat and watch a movie show and will sit on her computer while watching at times. if i ask to cuddle or show affection, she might sigh and say she s not into it and just prefers to laugh at the movie with me or find new shows together. which i also enjoy. she goes to bed early and wakes up super early to go to the gym. so the night routine would be about making sure she eats light and does whatever she needs to do so she can have energy to wake up at 4 5 am and go workout for 2 hours before coming back to see me off as i go to work. and sometimes that means not making out since that might cause her to have to stay up a little longer and end up falling asleep with me instead of staying on top of things so she can get up earlier. this process repeats daily except on saturdays when i m off and sometimes we don t end up getting to kiss then either. so i tend not to ask to kiss much anymore and just cuddle her while we sleep at night since this is the only time we can actually cuddle. she also had a hard time allowing me to compliment her and call her beautiful, pretty, sexy, or any flirtatious words, because she really doesn t think so and is not used to being comfortable with her body as it is and is always trying to manipulate it and change it. i usually don t mind her habits, but i would be lying if i said i didn t find her habits to be sometimes really annoying because it feels a lot like there s another person in the relationship her body and routine . it feels like it s so important to her that she s willing to focus really hard on it and not so much on building intimacy with me. the last factor is that we got married super fast after dating for a year, no ceremony or nothing. and it felt rushed because we didn t take our time with the engagement and felt pressured by our premarital counselor that was faith based instead of clinical based. so ever since then, that s been a factor as well. these things combined have put strains in our communication and ability to have emotional intimacy because half the time i m trying not to be viewed as an enemy for asking her honest questions about some of her habits in a nice way and encouraging her to go to therapy. we re getting better and have been in marriage counseling from a well practiced, empathetic therapist, but the lack of sex has been a concern for us. as for her habits, i ve begun to not say much about it and just let the counselor lead conversations about that when needed and sometimes we get to discuss it by ourselves as a couple. and we recently talked about how we can start approaching sex again. my wife starts individual therapy at the end of the month so that i m excited about and it gives me hope while i m still happy with this marriage, but any tips on how i can cope with this as we basically wait for a chance to be closer?",

"feeling shame. i'm really hoping to recover this year in my eating disorder. 2 21 was really awful for me and i feel so very lost in where i am emotionally and also with my eating. i studied abroad this fall in spain and while there my eating got bad. i started purging often, i was over exercising, and not eating enough for that amount of activity. my family noticed it and i every time i called them i was pretty much in tears. i felt very alive but also so ghostly and like i was somewhere else. my parents got very concerned and came to visit me and saw that i looked ""fine."" i came home before christmas and promised to get blood tests which came back normal and have gained so much weight. before i was about a pound short of being underweight but now i've gained a lot of it back. i know it's also the holidays, but i am just so worried. i have little motivation to exercise and haven't exercised really at all since i've been home. and my binging has gotten so problematic. it feels like a habit and has happened about everyday. i got presecribed anti anxiety medications which have messed up my sleep and i just feel emotionally very lost. i've always turned to food for comfort and so maybe thats why i've been binging so much. i wake up and tell myself everyday that i am not going to binge, but then i always end up doing it. this semester i am going to stay in school, but am going to do an intensive outpatient clinic with a nutritionist, group therapy, and all. part of me is excited to go through this and have so much support because i think it will help. but the other part of me feels like i'm not at a bad enough place which i know isn't right , but my blood work is healthy so why should i go to this place. it will feel embarrassing going to a place with other sick people when i feel like i'm healthy. and i feel shame. my biggest fear is becoming over weight. but maybe my biggest fear is just myself. the binges has been the worst part of all of this. i'm so scared of gaining weight and tired of this over taking my life. i wish i knew how to eat normally.",

my story. when i was 7 almost 8 my mom moved into the same house as my father which turned into two years of hell that ended when i was almost 1 . the abuse between both my parents was a lot to handle at such a young age and i had my brother to take care of since our parents were always to busy with each other to hang out with us. during this time i became depressed which lead me not eating. i would wait until my stomach hurt to eat and then only eat until the pain went away which didn t make me full and over this period the stomach pain took longer to kick in so i went longer without eating. i didn t stop eating because of weight in fact i didn t care about my weight i didn t mind how big or small i was it had everything to do with guilt. i felt as though i didn t deserve to be happy with the situation i was in and eating makes you happy. after we left that situation my dad became poor and didn t feed us a lot but my mom always went shopping when we were at his house and by this point i managed to start eating again and stay healthy but my dad not feeding us lead me to binge eat when we got back to my moms house because we were so hungry and eating all of the food made me happy. i remember making baked goods for my family and eating all of it myself and they couldn t have any. over the next couple of years i bounced back and forth between over eating and under eating. it wasn t until i started counseling that i realized my problem and at the time i was 3 pound underweight. i realized i had a lot of trauma and that none of it was my fault so i began loving myself and now i m 12 pounds underweight and getting better everyday i hope this post can inspire others to get better because it is possible it can an most likely will be a long battle but it s worth it and it is possible you just have to want it,

recovery and weight. tried recovering but somehow ended up not going any weight and that tiggred me to relapse,
"did do i have an eating disorder?. so, throughout my childhood i was able to maintain a healthy weight, but after a while i began to receive comments from a family member stating that i was getting fat and needed to lose weight, despite my doctors saying that i was the proper size for my age and that going a few pounds over was fine, as long as i keep it in control. anyway, i tried letting it go and eventually i did. i was a pretty happy kid for the most part and almost always ate 3 meals a day and never skipped until i reached age 11 or 12. around that time i became more self conscious about how i looked, but l'm not exactly sure why...i really don't understand what caused it all, but one day i just got in my head and thought that i shouldn't eat anymore because i thought people would judge me for it. like when l'd go to school, i'd just force myself to think that people were making fun of me for eating and so i stopped eating like i normally would to make all those thoughts go away. i just really dreaded eating in front of people. instead of eating healthy meals, i would only eat potato chips or soda only throughout the entire day and i did this for months until i noticed that my clothes were getting looser. then i weighed myself one day and noticed that i had lost a significant amount of weight, but it didn't bother me. i actually like the fact that i was losing weight because it made my legs and waist look smaller and it became so bad to the point where my ribs began to show. eventually, my significant weight loss began taking a toll on my health and i started feeling more dizzy, developed diaestive problems, had shortness of breath, and started to feel more weak whenever i tried doing normal activities. i thought was fine though because i went to the doctor about it multiple times and they always told me that nothing was wrong with me, but it definitely feels like there's a problem because i've never had these problems before this started. so here we are today over the years i have tried to fix my eating habits, but i don't think i'm doing very well with that. i was so used to ignoring myself when i got hungry that now i forget to eat sometimes. like l'll eat maybe once or twice a day now but l'm not like how i used to be because usually l'll just eat one large meal and just skip for the rest of the day or just eat small portions of food just to say i've ate something. it's really frustrating too because people just don't seem to understand that i'm trying and only see it as me being a difficult person, but the way i feel is more complex than they think. anyway, i was never diagnosed with an eating disorder nor do i know if my situation qualifies as something of the sort, but if someone could offer me suggestions or advice on how i can fix myself, please do so. thanks ",

"feelings of shame around body randomly. hi, this is my first post on reddit so i am unsure if this is the correct thread for this time of concern. i apologize if that s the case i struggled with an eating disorder throughout my sophomore and junior year of high school. i restricted heavily and exercised in order to lose weight. i lost a ton of weight and suffered physical affects from the drastic measures i took. i am a junior in college now, and have since recovered, and back at a normal weight. i feel as if i have a healthy relationship with food and exercise. however, what concerns me, is that recently i have randomly been feeling shameful about my body and self image. it s hard to describe like a cold feeling in my stomach that will randomly pop up and make me feel really bad and insecure about myself. it s very odd because i don t usually feel that way about myself. it will just pop up randomly and it makes me want to engage in eating disorder behaviors again. i am just curious if anyone else experiences this and how they go about these feelings? also, if anyone has any explanations on why this happens, that would be much appreciated as well ",

"prolonged stomach pains?. i know i can't ask for medical advice but i'm just curious if anyone else experienced this? for context, for the past couple weeks? months, maybe? i've been purging anything i eat, amp; other times i try to restrict as much as possible. i've dropped a significant amount of weight recently just as early as this past july august i was still in the 16 s, whereas as of today i've hit 14 .3lbs , amp; much more recently i've been far more restrictive. maybe 3 days ago i remember eating extremely little probably lt;2 cal. , amp; i don't remember if i purged. but the next day or so i didn't eat at all. then yesterday i ate some of an apple shared with my pets that can eat it , i had a cup of yogurt, some goldfish crackers amp; 2 small waffles leftover on the counter from breakfast that day. i 'binged' that all my 'binges' are usually 'normal' portions calorie counts for meals amp; hardly surpass even healthy amounts of calories, but i always eat it all at once in one sitting amp; immediately purged it. usually i let myself by with probably a net of 2 3 calories a day, even if i purge i know i can't get it all, but it's still very restrictive. anyway, i think not eating a single thing amp; purging the only thing i did eat after 2 days just took it out of me, because when i woke up today i felt like death. i woke up with a dull sharp pain in my stomach, amp; by the time i got up to use the bathroom it was shooting through my whole body, especially in my lower abdomen, almost mimicking period cramps. as i write this the pain seems to have subsided for the most part, but it's so consistent amp; painful. today, i'm not going to be purging; i know one more day hell, a lot of more days of this starving isn't going to kill me, but i can't be starving myself that badly. so far, today, i ate about half an apple, a peanut granola bar, amp; a glass of water. the thing that drove me to write this post though was because of how persistent the pains were? i started with the apple to help amp; admittedly ate it very slowly, but probably by the time i had 5 pieces of it about 1 4 i felt essentially no change in the pains amp; i gave in amp; ate the granola bar reluctantly, because why is a single tiny granola bar 17 calories? . i sipped the water in between bites of everything amp; i'm hoping that helps me feel more full. i just still feel hungry but in a way that i don't want to eat. i could barely stomach eating the food i had today, but i'm worried that i've gone from my old habits of binging all day earlier this year, to now i'm forcing myself to eat something, anything, because i just feel that shitty. do others experience this really bad pain too after restricting like that? because i've had bad hunger pains that make me wanna throw up, but those go away pretty fast after a bite or two. these pains feel like they shoot through my whole abdomen amp; make me feel sick amp; weak. just curious if this is common with heavy restriction, because i've never felt them this bad before little update before i post i think the pain has gone but it did really suck ",

do you ever just feel like its getting better then all sudden your back in that mindset.. the last two and half months i have not starved myself. i'm working out and seeing slow progress which is great. but a stuffed up part of my brain misses losing weight so much. i miss not eating i miss seeing the scales go down. it's like i associate it with some sort of fucked noestelgia. it makes me so deppresed eating normal meals everyday. a weird psrt of me just wants to be freezing cold hungry and tired all the time. but i know if i go back to that i'll just be more unhappy it's so dumb. it's so stupid tho because i know for me to actually look decent i need to eat and get muscle and get stronger. but my brain just associates everything with the scales. i just don't know why it has to be like this.,
"i need help. i don t know if i have an ed but i don t wanna eat, i m not hungry, and nothing tastes good. i just feel guilty and sick and i don t know what to do.",
"question regarding extreme weight loss and saggy skin. i don t know if this is allowed, especially the numbers so if it isn t please feel free to delete but i ve been losing weight really fast and i ve kind of noticed it in my body. i m terrified of my skin sagging. my hw was 25 so i was considered obese. now i m down to 21 in a matter of two months and i just don t know what happens if i lose more. i ve never seen pictures of people after they ve lost the weight in a dramatic way. i ve seen the ones where they exercise and they have saggy skin but if your basically restricting everything what happens there? my anxiety surrounding this is killing me..would really appreciate some explanation?",
"just need reassurance that it was ok too eat that.. im 18, not in recovery and no one rly knows ab my ed besides from best friend who doesn't go my school. decided last night too try and eat more structured; but an amount im more comfortable with because ive got alot of work too do in school and have been feeling abit happier so its easier too eat. ive been following an almost completely vegan diet for a few months but probs not for the right reasons. today one of my friends offered me a cookie she baked not vg and i made an excuse at first to not eat it but later at lunch she was persistsnt she wanted me too try one and i felt bad so said yes. tried abit, hid rest in bag. changed mind amp; ended up bloody eating it without trying too think too much. but now im just kinda panicking amp; feel uncomfortable because it wasnt in my plan amp; i dont know whats in it or the cals or anything i feel like i can feel the fat seeping into my stomach. like i just wish i hadnt ate it. it tasted good and its nice too not miss out again but its just so uncomfortable and i feel guilty about it my stomach feels warm and uncomfortable af. ik if this would have happened a few weeks ago when i was deeper in my ed and restricting more i would have been mortified but since ive sort of started feeling and eating abit differently not recovery but idk im not tooo stressed over it. it just feels wrong. should i have ate it or not? i cant really justify either.",
"has anyone gotten a feeding tube while at a normal weight. was at the nutritionist s office and i ve been losing weight the last couple of visits. she said if i keep losing i ll have to get a feeding tube since my body is malnourished, but i m 1 pound away of being overweight again . would i actually get a feeding tube if i was previously overweight, now a normal weight for my height?",
struggling. i am deep into my anorexia right now. can t remember the last time i ate and am sickly obsessed with how much of my bones are showing. i can t bring myself to eat because my medications suppress my appetite anyways and i don t want to lose the way my body looks right now. i know i need help i just don t know what to do. my boyfriend won t even talk to me anymore because he s so annoyed i won t eat yet he doesn t realize i have an eating disorder. ugh i m at such a loss i just needed to vent,
"i have become so picky, especially in the last few months idk whats going on. even if there is something i like it will only be for the first few times i eat it then its gross dk whats going on and the things i can eat now are very limited so im left malnourished",
"is it possible too still have an ed if things like this happen. for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours amp; thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much dont have the energy or just dont care enough tbh. the normal eating with little guilt not because it was safe foods or id compensated just genuinley alright w eating it only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction, trying too make it worse than last time. but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat feel normal for good but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it. idk. just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined. is this even an ed. ugh",
"i need help with some ed info. idk how an ed but i has been some time that i been having some problems with my eating schedule, nothing really big is just i eat to little at 3pm like a normal eating time and when night comes and it s time for dinner i eat way to much if i can and i tend to get hungry at afternoon, can i be developing an ed or something? thank u for reading",
"how to tell a club president who is now my friend about my eating disorder?. so i m in this club and was voted vice president. i have befriended all of eboard as they are great people, but i ve gotten really close to the president. i would consider her my friend but we mostly do talk about the club. recently, i ve relapsed in so many aspects of mental health, but it s mainly restriction. i ve passed out twice and missed a club meeting and an eboard meeting because of it. she s been kind of focused on me lately and asking if i m okay. i trust her and i think she d understand, and i know i don t have to tell her, but part of me thinks it would be better if i did. i ve just been saying medical issues, but i think she s noticing some things that i do. i also think i should bring this up as i might be getting treatment next semester and will miss some club meetings how do i bring this up? we hang out for a little bit before club meetings so we can talk in person and private. any advice is appreciated thank you : ",
"why cant i just be good at one thing wow. i feel so guilty that i ever said i have an ed how can i complain and then eat like this. does anyone else ever find that they sometimes have meals or days where they can basically eat a normal amount of normal food and not feel the need too compensate after. like what. this morning i sobbed for an hour over a bowl of cereal. but then was able too last min go out for dinner with my family. i mean i still was checking cals etc and the thoughts were there, but i chose too eat dinner and desert. no one forced me. like why do i feel like im constantly fluttering between my healthy brain telling me too bloody give life a try and get out of this hole, and the other telling me too just go deeper into my ed than before and then i can recover and think about how too sort my life out and ill be ready and worthy too recover. neither sounds appealing so im just in this uncomfortable middle of not wanting too engage in either. ik ill think different by the morning amp; probs restrict but i'm so tired of this. at least i felt not so bloody depressed later in the day meet my family lol. i think feeling like that made it much easier too eat. i feel so invalid. just be consistent fml. anyone else ever feel similar.",
why isn t my body hungry?. so ever since high school my body has always gone through these phases where it s not hungry or it doesn t have an appetite which would result in me eating very little. it got really bad when i was around 17 years old i went from 1 pounds to 92 took a toll on my mental health and i was not confident. i should mention that i m also 5 ft 2 in so already pretty petite. it took a few months to get to 1 2lbs this was the weight the doctor said i was supposed to be at for my age and height . i spent three days a week exercising while drinking 2 to 3 ensure s each day every other day along with vitamins and trying to eat as much as i could. after i got to my accomplished weight i was finally happy my body felt healthy and stronger. the phases would come and go but i would always stick to my routine so it never got worrisome. for the past 2 to 3 days i ve been feeling a loss of appetite ofcourse i am still sticking to my routine so again i m not worried but i am curious as to why it even started happening in the first place. now that i m approaching my adulthood years i wonder if it s an eating disorder or just the fact that my body was still is changing. this has been reoccurring ever since i was 16 i am about to be 2 in january.,
"cant do anything right with guilt ugh.. tw? mention of purging idk if this is common or just another think my ed wants too make me miserable for. but id planned on fasting today too compensate for other things eaten day before, ended up eating unplanned food. nothing really too unhealthy amp; almost all still vegan which im glad im sticking too. but either way not the plan and now i feel like a failure and scared as shit im gonna gain again like yday. im pretty sure it was below maintenance but since i couldnt purge all of it the 'typical' way; ive started working out more again, sp for the last hour or so i was working out, and the second i start too actually enjoy it and not only do it too feel ok after what i ate and less anxious. like i was kinda doing it cause it felt fun i start feeling guilty becaude this should be for punishment amp; compensation not for me too enjoy. so that sucks. now theres literally nothing i can do. ive been feeling guilty for sitting recently and found myself trying too always be moving. i cant watch things for long unless their related too ed's, food, weight loss, or i feel there a good use of my time like they're beneficial too my ed so not even that i can escape too which used too be the biggest coping thing for me. love that. now i just feel guilty, sick from the food, and theres nothing too enjoy but im still telling myself theres nothing actually wrong. someone fix my brain pls. also, just drank white monster for the first time in months whilst working out and omg. tastes like restriction in a bottle its like drinking nostalgia in a can wth ",
"can someone help?. i got out of ed res about a month ago, and i've lost an amount of weight that's made me eligible to go back but the past few days i haven't been scared of food at all and i've been eating a lot definitely not my usual self i have no idea what's going on. does somebody know?",
"eating disorders are sometimes also metabolic endocrine disorders and not just psychiatric ones: story of a friend. hello, tl;dr; binge eating and other eating disorders is sometimes also a metabolic endocrine disorder and not just a psychiatric one and restoring metabolic health can help tremendously with recovery a friend of mine suffered from extreme bed since she was 13. this, among other things, caused her to be morbidly obese and she also developed pcos. she was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward twice self admitted . despite all the therapy and meds, she was never able to control the disorder, because she just could not fight against the urges to binge. i myself am a final year medical student central europe . after talking to her, she told me that she gets these intense cravings randomly throughout the day. i thought, well, maybe we can tackle this from the metabolic side in addition to her going to therapy . so i suggested she should talk to her physician in order to get a prescription for metformin insulin sensitizing antidiabetic medication and an sglt2 inhibitor causes around 1 g of carbohydrates to be lost via the urine every day . the metformin er 2g day the empagliflozin 12.5mg d helped with the metabolic dysregulation by counteracting the insulin resistance. insulin resistance is also one of the main factors that causes overweight individuals to be very hungry, because the stored adipose tissue fat cannot be tapped into, because the high levels of insulin inhibit lipolysis fat breakdown . this causes people to become very hungry quite soon after eating. furthermore, i cleaned up her diet. we settled on a paleo like diet with slow release carbs with low glycemic index e.g. beans, peas, sweet potatoe, other veggies , plenty of good fats olive oil, butter, avocado , and protein. we removed fast spiking carbs e.g. bread, pasta, potatoes, etc. and milk products as whey and casein the milk proteins have some endocrine activity and can lead to inflammation and cravings due to their synergizing effects on insulin as well as igf1 a hepatic growth factor . well, low and behold, after 2 weeks of ups and downs, she did not have one single binge in over 5 months. her weight loss is in the image. currently, she sits at 75kg and is still losing and binge free. the story as well as the screenshot below is of course posted with her permission . the therapy targeting the psychological side of things was ineffective until also the metabolic endocrine side of things was addressed after which both components worked synergistically. while binging often has a large psychological component addiction, stress eating , there is also an endocrine metabolic internistic component e.g. intense craving due to metabolic dysregulation which is often neglected by many doctors. i just want to share her journey as well as encourage some of you to talk to your physician to tackle the metabolic side of things, because, if the physiological craving is eliminated, controlling binges is a lot easier. moral of the story: bed has sometimes also a metabolic endocrine component and not just a psychiatric one. and this metabolic endocrine component i.e. one of multiple factors could either be a contributing cause or a disorder maintaining consequence of bed. nonetheless, whether cause or consequence, it can be targeted with specific medical interventions, which should could help tremendously with recovery esp. in subjects whose eating is triggered by hunger pangs and not purely due to stress coping, etc. bonus: instead of the empagliflozin, even more effective would be a glp1 agonist e.g. liraglutide , which is both an insulin sensitizer, slows stomach emptying gt; less hunger pangs , as well as activates pomc neurons in the hypothalamus gt; greater and prolonged satiety and greater energy levels . in the near future, she will likely switch out the empagliflozin for the liraglutide. an excerpt of a study regarding the use of glp1 agonists in bed is shown below. amp; x2 b; https: preview.redd.it 5nl8n8r7oj381.jpg?width 858 amp;format pjpg amp;auto webp amp;s 734aff6141ab429582e442dd98723 12 61bb49a https: preview.redd.it u1z o9g1oj381.jpg?width 2154 amp;format pjpg amp;auto webp amp;s fd31882dd49141226 c4e3e27db8cbdecea38b29 i crossposted this in r eatingdisorders",

idk what to do. so i finally had the guts to open up to my therapist about my purging and she said that s a normal teenage thing . that really confused me because i mean i m the only teenager she sees because she s an adult therapist but she made me feel like what i was doing isn t bad at all. she didn t tell me to stop so i m not going to. i was hoping she would help me because i know it s not healthy but whatever i guess.,
"tired and stressed af. will i gain? is this usual thoughts for eds?. tw idk? no numbers just mention of purging and reference too weight loss restricted this week successfully after not rly doing it 'good' for a few weeks amp; gained weight too a number i was uncomfortable with. diddnt weigh for a few days whilst restricting bc i had not enough time in schedule too weigh how i need too like before hand so wasnt sure how much if i lost gained. but felt like i was eating unsafe too much during those days even though i was tracking amp; was restricting. was halve sure i gained and halve sure i lost. but just begging too just b under what i considered uncomfortable dangerous weight. so today when i could finally i did and was relieved amp; elated too see i lost way more than i thought i did. too a num ive not been in a month or so. then i seem too always fall back into a pattern of when i loose weight part of me thinks its ok too eat so i fucking did amp; i ate mainly chocolate and crap. restricted in a sense but stopped tracking cals after abit but im sure it was around my maintenance ? spent the rest of the day every time after eating resetting my fucking fasting timer amp; then after the initial freak out amp; guilt of what i just ate went away id eat again and reset again. cried basically the whole afternoon and night lol and tried too excersize abit but just too tired too so now i feel like a fake and guilty coz i cant even compensate good enough ha amp; used unhealthy coping mechanisms after but now im just lying here 1 pm tears sticking too my face feeling like such a faliure sad little piece of crap ha bcos not only did i unsuccessfully purge, excersize amp; restrict. im paranoid amp; sad af that tomorrow when i weigh i will have gained and that number will be further away again amp; ill be forever stuck in a cycle of reaching a gw, giving in amp; eating, loosing control amp; gaining amp; then spendjng weeks just trying to get back control amp; too a manageable comfortable weight. i feel like ive ruined everything and my body will just balloon overnight. like all these cals will turn too fat since i'm just lying here in bed not utilising it for energy. i feel too guilty too sleep but i'm tired af and too tired too workout which makes me feel guilty clz if i was rly unwell i would do it regardless until it felt safe too stop. so nlw im just lying here dreading the weight gain of tomorrow and having too look in the mirror back too square one. is this even a normal ed thought pattern. is anything even wrong. this is fkn horrible. will i gain? is it possible since it was cal dense and right before sleep. my heads going to explode and i just want to bloody sleep. ty for reading ugh fat brain dump but this ed can fuq off. not rly lol dont leave me c stay safe lt;3 also . why am i incapable of writing a short post omg",
"i m worried i may be on the path to developing an ed but i m not exactly sure and it s making me nervous. so i already struggle with some form of restrictive food intake because i m neurodivergent but i ve recently noticed my thoughts becoming more worrisome when it comes to food, i ll find myself saying that i shouldn t eat at all and getting upset with myself for eating certain things some days i can eat food normally with no problem other days i ll get upset at myself for eating those same foods because i fear gaining weight or being seen as fat even though i m of an average weight . right now i m drinking coffee and that voice in my head is happy with it because coffee boosts metabolism. i ve been wanting to work out more so i can get toned but my motives for that aren t really because i think i m like morbidly obese but i don t like how my stomach looks?? i m fine with everything else though for the most part. i m just very confused and worried. as a kid i used to not eat out of spite and nowadays i sometimes won t eat for most of the day because everything sounds awful. it s not always about weight but sometimes it is, i just want to find a way to stop these thoughts from becoming something more dangerous.",
venting. i ate today and i feel horrible about it. i just thought it would be better if i eat but i overate. now i want to throw up and i hate myself,
"i think it s getting bad again vent . as a kid i was a bit overweight, and obviously everyone had to comment on it. every single time my mom, sister and brother said i was getting a bit too round my twelve year old self wanted to cry. so i started taking smaller portions on purpose, even when i was still hungry. i lost a bit of weight but still felt horrible about my body. part of this was because i m trans, and i didn t realize that gender dysphoria was part of what i was feeling. so all the bad feeling i had about my body regarding my gender i just associated it with my size because that s what everyone around me seemed to care about and was what i understood about myself at the time. i remember this one time at a family gathering, the first thing my aunt said to me was that i had finally lost weight and i looked good. i think it was at that moment we re eating became something that started to really bother me. if all i needed was to be skinny to look good, then fuck it. so i ate less and less over the years. at first it wasn t so bad, it wasn t healthy but it wasn t severe. then came quarantine. literally this one comment changed the way i saw myself and how i ate. a girls i knew said that her chest became smaller since she lost weight. immediately then my trans guy brain said hold up that s another reason to stop eating. with online classes alone at home, i ate nothing for breakfast and lunch and ate enough at supper to not look suspicious but that s all. when i made new friends, came out to them and felt happier, i started gaining a better relationship with food again. all was going well until about two months ago, one of my best friends kills himself. all of a sudden my whole mental health came crashing down. i started drinking a lot, felt horrible and made a lot of bad decisions. one of those bad decisions was starting to purge the food i ate. it started off eating normally but throwing up my supper. then i stopped eating breakfast and brought smaller lunch portions to school. i check every single item to see the calories. now i just hate eating as whole and dread every single meal. and with all this being a man with an eating disorder can fell kinda lonely. i barely see any other guys ready to speak up about their experiences my best friend also has an eating disorder so i don t want to bother them with this information so i dont really have anyone else i trust enough to talk about this with, so yea that s my vent hope y all have a great day",

"how do you react when you get triggered?. i had a ed years ago, lowkey falled back in the pandemic and i'm better now. i love preparing meals and writing all the things down that i want to cook because that motivates me. i had a really good day and send a round snap to my friends when i was cooking. one of them told me that my meal looked really good, i told him what was in it and also about how many calories it has. it was a good amount, healthy very filling and really yummy. first he said: ""not that you starve"" so i told him that this wasn't my first meal. i also had a good meal in the university cafeteria, a coffee inbetween, made my second meal and already plan my third meal and that i am really looking forward to it. then he said something on the line that he's now scared that i will pop like a balloon. i know that he didn't mean to hurt me, he was just trying to be funny, but... something in this sentence triggered me. commenrs on my body always make me remember how my oldest sister pointed out my rolls when i was a kid. i was a freaking kid. i tried to brush it of and told him that it's all in my calorie requirement so it's all good. and even if it woulf be over the calorie requirement, who gives a fuck, i'm not saying no to something to eat when i'm hungry because i had enough calories that day, it ain't enough if you are still hungry. i was really looking forward to my third meal but that comment really made me lose my appetite... how do you all react on such situations? edit: i made myself a big yummy veggie chicken sandwich which looked as good as it tasted.",
"getting out of chsp eating disorder. i 2 nb have struggled with an ed since i was 13. a huge part of my ed has been chewing and spitting food chsp and i feel like rn it's taken over my life. i do it any chance i get and it's taken away from my life, my mental health, and my academics. i want to stop but i don't know how and anyone i talk to about it seems pretty dismissive. if anyone has overcome this, i would appreciate any advice.",
