"i recently found out i have permanent hair loss. how the f will my body image issues ever get better ?. for years i was convinced that starving myself for 1 years was the primary cause of my hair loss. i lost 6 to loss of density and bald patches. even the dermatologist who was treating me said i had te and likely alopecia areata. but i m black, and as i ve understood from nearly a decade of going to dermatologists, they are not trained to study black hair loss conditions. anyways, i ve been diagnosed with a form of scarring alopecia that will either spread across my entire scalp until i m completely bald or eventually burn out and just leave some permanent bald patches while the rest of my hair can grow back but likely never to its original length . my recovery has been absolutely fine so far from the year i ve been in it my weight is restored, i have ed behaviors or thoughts, but knowing my hair looked its best at the height of my ed than it does now in recovery is metafuckery. i m recovering so i won t die but wtf, it would ve been nice to see hair regrowth as a motivation to keep eating better ...now that i know my hair loss is partly from fucked up genetics and a possible autoimmune disorder, i just feel defeated already .",

"my collegue made me realise how fragile my recovery still is, after 3 years already.. i want to say i'm fully recovered. like, i eat normally and i made a mind shift to body positivity, intuitive eating, have better coping mechanisms etc, like i don't ""need"" my ed to feel a form of control over my world, i know it doesn't make me happy and there is more in life than diet making myself smaller blablabla. but now i have this coworker who wants to lose like 1 pounds, for health reasons. i get her and her story and i actually encourage her to do it because it's for her health, she's with a dietician etc , but she's not overweight in any way just normal, like i am now . and just her talking about wanting to lose weight made me miss my ed so much? every day in recovery i build a piece, making it stronger, but this wall can be torn down in a second because of one comment like this? one normal conversation about maybe wanting to lose weight and having a valid reason to do so, makes me so fragile and vulnerable for a relapse. how do you handle this? it's hard to say to her to not talk about it, because she doesn't know about my former ed and i don't feel comfortable telling her about it, but this conversation made me so sad : i don't know what to do",

eating disorder. i deal with anorexia i was diagnosed when i was 15 and it s just so hard my bf tries to help me with it and i try to eat for him but there are days i just go without eating and then i look in the mirror and i m like wow i m so tiny and i feel so ashamed or upset. i don t even realize i don t eat sometimes until i feel weak i have to convince myself that it is okay to eat 3 times a day and then when i try my hunger just goes away and i waste food if there is anyone else dealing with anorexia what are some things that have helped you ? i also use to weigh myself a lot and i use to count the calories i was in taking and being hungry use to give me satisfaction my bf has taken all the calorie labels off my food to help me too.. i ve been to doctors and with medicine but the cost of medicine is soo high to help me eat i can t afford it all the time please no mean comments,
i ate out today for the first time. went out with a friend and had ramen and chimichangas looking forward to some ice cream for dessert. i realized how isolated and alone anorexia made me. it took away friendships and fun. tonight i fought back and had an amazing time.,
"recovering at home on a budget tips. this is going to be long, and i only felt the need to post this because when i first started my recovery, inpatient wasn't an option and i had no access to medical help. everything felt hopeless, i was disabled due to being underweight, i barely even knew any of the real medical aspects of recovery, and no one could give me any worthwhile weight gain tips. so here's some of the biggest things that helped me, and i hope they can help someone in a similar situation. obviously, these are just things that helped me in a tight spot and medical guidance is extremely highly recommended if possible. the most important thing was to intake as many calories as possible, no matter what it was. being on a super tight budget, fast food, lots of peanut butter, eggs, and granola bars were my best friends. the thing that made the biggest difference at first was having many small snacks readily available throughout the day. eat everything you can get your hands on, eat everything that makes you feel good. guilty pleasures aren't real. i had a hard time gathering an appetite for anything, but i found that even a couple bites of something light ex. watermelon, cucumber, crackers, etc helped with that. when i felt like i couldn't even down that, water with mio or lemon lime did the trick. the next thing was forcing food down, no matter what. i learned it will hurt at first, but it must be done look into refeeding guidelines, however, because in certain situations it can be dangerous your stomach does shrink over time, and it has to be retrained to intake a normal amount of food, as i'm sure a lot of people in this situation know already. all i can say is keep pushing. it is worth it. on a more emotional level, i found it was actually very helpful for me to completely get off of social media and stop taking pictures of myself for the time being. things like instagram and twitter where i was constantly bombarded with pretty, ""perfectly"" figured girls only made things more miserable. as for specific foods, i found you cannot have any sort of diet restrictions. save for medically necessary of course meat, dairy, etc cannot be off limits if not needed. dairy in particular was a huge part of my recovery. protein shakes helped a bit, but i personally found that creatine supplements helped even more. i hate nestle as much as the next person, but their benecalorie supplements helped so much on days where i felt i couldn't get enough calories in. cook it in pancakes, put it in your cereal milk, mix it in a smoothie milkshake, etc. clifbars, lil debbie's nutter butters, and pasta were my next best friends. like i said, guilty pleasures aren't real. get whatever has the most calories. however, long term restrictions in diet inevitably lead to vitamin deficiency. if possible, get blood work done at the least to see what's needed. do eat fruit veggies between higher calorie foods to make sure you're getting what you need. take a multivitamin every day, soak up some sun when possible, and absolutely do not feel guilt for sitting around doing absolutely nothing. that's more calories you get to keep, and they're your absolute best friend during this. every calorie counts. it's a long, shitty road with lots of bumps, and that's okay. because it will make a difference, you will feel more like yourself, and if you're like me, you'll look back and wish you were coddling yourself the whole time. i'm still in recovery myself over a year later, but i will never forget the path here. please dm me if there's any other specific foods products etc you'd like a link to, or even just to chat about it all. i know none of this is easy alone.",
im tired. im tired of half my brain incessantly counting down the minutes until i eat again while the other half calls me horrible names for wanting food at all,
"weird things i do. whenever i m alone, i tend to eat alot more than i would with someone home.then i would get guilty because my grandparents would assume that my extreme hunger died down because i wasn t grabbing a snack every 3 minutes.but they didn t know how much i ate when they were absent from the house.sometimes i would confess what i entirely ate very specifically so they would know that it didn t die down yet",
"unsupportive friend . so i m ip right now for general psych not for ed even though i m struggling with my ana as well and i ve made this friend here who i ll call b. so b has been having troubles eating because of her medication for the past four days she has no history of an ed. and she won t. stop. talking about it. but the thing is she actually is eating. she s drinking ensures and eating junk food but when anybody asks, like a nurse or another patient, she tells them she hasn t eaten for four days. she often even brings it up in conversation. she s told me that she doesn t know how she s not dead yet from not eating for 4 days and she think she s going to get tubed for not eating for so long. she keeps mentioning that she can t eat, is discussing her weight and continually talks about her hunger pains. she won't stop and i keep trying to reassure that i understand and have been there, have been tubed, have not eaten for extended periods of time but she's being invalidating to me and isn t even acknowledging me and my ed and what i'm trying to say to her. it s making my eating disorder worse being around her talking about how she can t eat, is refusing to eat because of the smell apparently and i feel like i can t even eat the smallest thing around her without being judged. now, i m trying to recover and i m trying to not lose any more weight in order to get into a treatment program. so this all is not a good situation for me. b also has autism and i know she wouldn t understand and would take offence if i mentioned it to her that i find all of this triggering. i don t know what to do",
how long will it take?weight mentioned. i experienced anorexia for about 1 2 months and have been on a all in recovery for the past 23 days and im just wondering when it would end i lost about 1 2 pounds of weight during anorexia with my lowest being at 1 9 at 5 7.i want to start working out because i want to regain what i had before it all started like such as my abs because i lost them during recovery but i know that working out during all in is a bad thing to do.i might just be scared and unconscious of my body because i had to see my weight 1 2 weeks ago and i weigh higher than my pre ed self,

"tw: my friend is extremely triggering. first of all sorry for my english, it is not my first language so basically i ve been trying to recover from my ed for a while now and it s been really hard. almost no one knows this besides my therapist and a few friends i ve always struggled with opening up about my ed, even with my family, therapist and my closest friends. back in march, i became friends with a girl that i m pretty sure that has some kind of eating disorder, she always is talking about how she never eats or how she fasts for insane amounts of time. we share a lot of classes together and she always skips lunch and doesn t eat during the breaks that we have. she is always talking about food in very triggering ways and is really competitive about it when we do eat together. it s been extremely exhausting and triggering for me, it reminds me of my days when i was deep into my own ed and it sucks. when i m with her, i feel so guilty for trying to eat like a normal person and it s really fucking with my recovering journey. i really don t know what to do bc i don t want to stop being her friend, she is the only friend that i have in college and i really like and care about her, besides this issue. but i don t feel comfortable sharing my own issues, i don t think i trust her enough for that and i don t want her to compete with me even more since she will know that i have an ed. i would love to tell her to stop talking about things related to food and her ed when i m around, but i don t think that s right either, it would be so selfish, i just can t ignore the fact that she is constantly starving and damaging her health, even if she is not looking to recover any time soon, i m still very worried about it. i just don t know what to do anymore, i m so tired and i feel so close to relapse bc of this, i really don t know what to do.",

"advice on overshoot please. hi all, so i've been in recovery for a little over a year now, since april 2 21. last summer, i overshot and kept gaining weight all through winter into spring. i've made the mistake of weighing myself, and i realized that i overshot my pre ed weight by a full 4 . now, i know that weight changes with age, but i was 21 when i first got sick and i'm 25 now, so it's not like i was a teen back then or got any taller. i'm really stressed out and concerned right now. i weighed less in february, when i last weighed myself, than i do now. so i'm extremly worried that i'll just keep gaining even more, i had to threw out all my clothes and i can't buy new ones every few months also i just miss my old body type and feeling comfortable amp; at home in my body, i don't want that to be related to my weight but i've been pretty skinny my entire life and i just miss the way my shape and my face used to look. has anyone else experienced an overshoot this extreme, and did it eventually taper down for you? i'm so unhappy and i'm really, really struggling. i feel so lonely and just need some reassurance that it won't be like this forever ",

"mindset is everything . so as i ve mentioned in here before, after four months of unknowingly being in a somewhat pseudo recovery restricted state, i am back to eating a ton and i can already see the telltale signs of increasing metabolism, not least of which is being hot all the fucking time and sweating. but i was thinking back to the 3 months over the winter where i was in full blown recovery mode and what was different. the answer is mindset. i wasn t compulsively checking my body. i wasn t constantly thinking about my body or recovery. i trusted that i was doing the right thing and that the water weight would come off and slowly it really was. i was engaged in my career, my life, my wife and children. i was being patient and i had lots of energy. i had ups and downs during that time but the downs were very minor. i had zero insomnia and i had no anxiety. why? because being in a positive state of mind actually effects your physiology and we all know that. but also being in a positive state of mind made it easier to do the self care i needed to do to get out of this nightmare. and when you re eating enough, your parasympathetic nervous system is more dominant. you have better vagal tone. which then lowers your anxiety making it easier to be positive and more mindful. it s a spiral up. my therapist used to tell me you either spiral up or your spiral down. it s your choices that make the difference. well today, despite feeling like not doing this, i m recommitting to seeing the glass as half full, to trusting the process, to trusting myself, and most importantly trusting god that he knows what s best for my body and my soul. if i balloon up to a thousand pounds of water, so be it. im going to enjoy my life and enjoy food and enjoy this process. im going to choose to love my body exactly as it is today, with all the water weight and everything, and recommit to that every day and i will not beat myself up for mistakes or for pseudo recovery. i m learning lessons like an innocent child, which is what we all need to be. i know this isn t like a light switch but as adults there are small practices we can do daily to develop the habits of realistic but positive thinking. breathing exercises, journaling, working on small changes to obsessive thinking. i highly recommend the book learned optimism . in fact i may just read that again now. we have to trust ourselves and our bodies to patiently make the tiny steps. we must forgive ourselves. god love you all and i hope and pray and know we can all get through this.",

"my convenience anorexia . tw i mention an approximate weight for myself. you re probably wondering wtf i m talking about. but first some background i ve been in recovery for 8 months. in the beginning i was eating a ton like 7 calories a day. i m a big guy, let s just say i m over 2 bills, not weighing so i can t get specific. and i have been retaining tons of water for months, as i have bitched on here about many times before. i m not afraid of food, i have no restrictions, i am not afraid of fats or carbs, thanks be to god i actually love food now. in the last several months i thought my appetite had stabilized at 32 35 cals a day. but my energy was depleting and i was just still sitting here like a big water balloon full of water and then it hit me, i haven t been really honoring my hunger. but not because of emotional or mental desires to restrict, but simply old patterns of life. i got so used to fasting in my old life that lately i was just delaying breakfast which would practically ruin my appetite for the rest of the day. it almost seemed hard to even eat 3 some days. so yesterday i got up early and ate breakfast first thing in the morning and holy moly the extreme hunger has returned clearly i haven t recovered. i ate 6 meals yesterday and i tracked damn near 6 calories. i have been an absolute vacuum cleaner ever since. even in the middle of the night last night my body woke me up to eat. my pants fit more loosely on me today than they have in months. water going away? i sure hope so i m super happy i figured this out but it s also a bummer because it feels like i wasted months i could ve been recovering, but maybe i just wasn t ready yet i call it convenience anorexia because it is sometimes just easier to not eat because you re so used to not spending much time eating i used to eat once every other day for example. getting out of this involves re confronting ourselves so many times over and over and confronting fears of imperfection, rejection, pressure etc. all we can do is move forward and keep trying to get better. trial and error. we must bravely be willing to get up and try again. i m going to sleep with muffins and other goodies next to my bed tonight so i can eat them before i fall asleep and first thing in the morning anyway i hope this helps someone. please give any advice or experiences that might help me feel normal about all this hunger how long did extreme hunger last for you? and did you ever have multiple bouts of it? man i m so hungry right now hahaha gonna go eat again ",

"im on my path of recovery but im in so much anxiety. hi all i've found this subreddit to be very helpful the past few days. it's a lot to read but i appreciate you a lot if you do. i'm 2 . i have been struggling with anorexia binge purge type for almost 6 years. in october 2 2 , i was referred to a program at my hospital to get checkups on my eating disorder. i was i'm major denial about being sick or needing help. none of my symptoms stopped. in early 2 21 there was some progress in my weight but symptoms were still there. this is possibly due to the fact that i had no therapist or full outpatient team because "" i was too busy"" like i said. i was constantly told i'd have to go to the hospital if i didn't stop and was recommend to go to php. i kept saying i was busy. and i still just didn't want help. when august 2 21 came around, i got worse. i felt my energy decreaing quicker, work performance was bad, i didn't return to college. i got into a relationship in which i let my insecurities get in. my boyfriend wasn't fully aware of my situation or what even an eating disorder was, so a lot of things were said that i took to heart badly. in october i started calling php programs and also residential programs for help, but was turned away because insurance. so i gave up. i quit my job in december, and decided to try and look for help again, but no luck. i thought i'd use the time off work to focus on recovery but i just kept getting sucked into the eating disorder more. frequent doctor visits and seeing that i was declining in weight more, i grew happy. i found a therapist but i didn't seem to care. until april 2 22. i almost passed out in a public place. an ambulance came and my blood pressure was low. i spent 4 days in the er. i realized something needed to change. that i didn't want to die but i also don't want to gain weight. i stopped binging and purging slowly but i still felt sick due to not eating at all. in may, i was at my lowest and decided to go into the hospital for refeeding as recommend by my doctor. i had called a residential place that had a admission date for me, but in the end didnt work because insurance. i ended up doing php from june 23rd up until a week ago, because i was told i needed a higher level of care, even though i know i've been eating my meals and not binging or purging. turns out i'm still loosing weight even if i'm eating. i'm not sure what to do. i want to get better and i don't want my weight to continue to fall. i just want to be healthy. i've seen my doctor but he said to go to residential possibility, and hell see me in 2 weeks. i am eating. i am doing my best. i know i need help and i'm looking for a new therapist and now a nutrionist. but i'm scared my weight won't go up for weight restoration. i'm scared the refeeding sydrome is still going on and now i have a hyper metabolism. i don't know if anyone can tell me if this is possible to fix at home. what should i do?",
"i just cant let go i want to i shrink until i m nothing. i ve suffered with an ed for over 1 years now. when i try to recover it works well for a while but i constantly relapse. i hate how skinny i am but petrified of gaining weight. i m so tired of it all, i just wana vanish. every time i try to eat then i feel bad so i just binge and then purge. not sure if i m anorexic or bulimic at this point. i m giving up",
"i m in recovery but i feel like i m getting nowhere. ive probably struggled with anorexia and eating issues for as long as i ve ever known, but i can pinpoint where it got severe in my life. i m much better than what i used to be realistically but i still feel so unfulfilled. every time i don t know what to eat i have a breakdown and i m always hungry, i ve not gained any weight which is what s making me feel worse as i ve been doing this for at least 6 months. my bf was cuddling me n touched my bone on my hip n he shook is head n that s replaying on my mind so much. he knows i struggle with eating and he is the best cheerleader to help me get better but it s really upset me that his reaction to my body is no even though i ve been spending months trying to gain weight. i know anorexia isn t a weight disorder but i was really hoping for weight gain in my recovery as i feel unhealthy : ",
"honestly i'm afraid. i'm honestly afraid, my therapist really wants me to go to a recovery program. she has to approve i'm fit for surgery in order to bottom surgery so i'm kinda forced to go, unless i want to wait 1 years to get a new one and wait for the needed time. most likely i'd end up going to monte nido and i'm hoping i have to do iop and not a live in program. does anyone have experience with monte nido and if so how was it?",

"stress and periods. heey i ve been in a recovery for a few months and so far i ve gained some weight back. i m still not weight restored and i don t have my periods yet. i know that i might need to gain some more weight and it also takes time to get your periods back, but i was just wondering how much stress effects it. if you have experience with periods being affected by stress more than how much body fat do you have, please would you share some tips what helped you to regulate the stress and how to relax and so on. thanks",
"today my boyfriend told me i m gonna die . today, my boyfriend told me that if i don t start eating i m going to die. my body is slowly eating itself, and i know it. hearing him say it though, the person i love and care about most, that hurt. nothings ever hurt more. i m scared to die. but i m scared to gain weight..",
inpatient tw suicide . i've posted on here once before i ended up chickening out on treatment bc i didn't get the bloodwork i needed in time and it was like an easy enough out you know. i am at a point where i know i probably need treatment like i know my body shouldn't feel like it does at my age and it's probably bc of this. but i am honestly sort of worried about the idea of inpatient treatment. i also have bipolar disorder and i've been hospitalized before after a su cide attempt and that was really sort of traumatizing for me and put me on a path where i was being sort of heavily medicated to the point where i have long term side effects from them. i stopped taking them like a year ago and got a medical marijuana card to deal w the side effects of my mental illness. this has worked really well for me bc being on medication took away my ability to live independently and i'm at a point where i can deal w my symptoms that way. i had an intake appointment a bit ago and they would like to like put me in inpatient but i'm worried about having to go back onto psychiatric medication bc they won't let me use the marijuana in the hospital and i don't want to be forced into using pills and i don't know if that's like crazy or not.,

"i'm out, weight restored, still sick tw . tw i'm sorry for this post as it won't benifit anyone or make my situation better. this is also not meant to get anyone to try to save my decision. i wish every person suffering to recover and experience happiness. after trying hard to eat every day, gaining kilo after kilo and falling deeper into my depression and addicition, i can't manage to do this anymore. the more i gain, the more i take and it's wearing me down to a point where i don't leave the house anymore, start fights about eating for others as i couldn't find the strength motivation in myself and generally lost myself in the process. and even worse, my bad mood and my ego lead me to give into my addiction, enough to lose my best friend which i've known since i was just a few months old. i know it's possible, i know it just needs more time, but i can't stand the stress anymore. i may get into my habits of burning out again, but i can't manage more than that. i want to work and go out again, everything, social, work, school, is suffering from my recovery. i fucked this school year up, i can't do another one. and now, i need to focus on my life, not my weight and ""well being"". i'm sorry, but i have to leave this sub. i appreciated the help and i'll try to motivate every person i see to look into this sub, as y'all are such loveable and wonderful people with the best intentions to help others and give great advice at any time. i hope y'all find more strength than i did to recover and start living again.",

"going ""all in"" do i have the right idea?. hey folks :d a bit of background tw: numbers : 22m through calorie restriction and exercise, i have lost weight below my body's natural comfort zone and have a bmi of about 18, on the high end of underweight. i was naturally thin athletic before my ed so now i am very lean. friends and family have been expressing concern about how thin i've gotten as a result of my restrictive ed. since returning home from college dorms at the end of the term, my mother has been persistent with her comments about how i do not eat enough, need to bulk up etc. furthermore, i have been battling stubborn injuries that will not heal and i suspect it is due to my undernourishment. i have experienced many of the symptoms associated with being underweight like being tired, cold, irritable, and constantly thinking about food etc. on account of the aforementioned reasons, i have decided to make an attempt at recovery. i want my health and fitness back, this ed has made me tired, weak, and injury prone. the other day, i decided to go ""all in"" and honor my extreme hunger. i am recovering at home sans professional supervision. because i am not severely malnourished, i do not think i am at risk of refeeding syndrome. anyway, i have been making big batches of trail mix trader joe's stylewith nuts, dried fruit, lots of chocolate chips, butterscotch chips etc. even after a full meal, i will still feel hungry and begin snacking incessantly. in the past two days, i must have eaten like 6 cups of trail mix, lots of granola, protein snack bars. it is absolutely ridiculous. it is getting to the point where i am eating snacks so constantly throughout the day that regular meals aren't even appealing because i have eaten well beyond my physical hunger cues. is this ok? should i take a more calculated approach of just 3 meals snacks? or should i continue to just raid my pantry every 2 minutes and only sit down for a proper meal if i am feeling inclined to? bare in mind that with all the snacking, i have been consuming 3 calories minimum. probably closer to 4k my stomach is a little uncomfortable from all of the food but i am trying to nourish myself with low volume calorie dense foods to avoid digestive distress hence the trail mix . tldr: since going all in, my extreme hunger has lead me to snack incessantly. i have been devouring high energy foods like trail mix, granola, bars, shakes etc. it s like all i m doing is eating.. is this ok? has anyone else experienced this? feeling like you have to be snacking on something constantly throughout the day?",

"questions about refeeding hypermetabolic. i am recovering from significant weight loss and am about 3 months into the process of upping calories. i was wondering how you can tell if you re at risk for refeeding syndrome still versus just hypermetabolism. i don t know how long the risk of refeeding syndrome is present for. i know i m in hypermetabolic because i m going through over 1 grams of potassium a day and my magnesium needs are high..they always were though and i was deficient for awhile. i m experiencing spasms and some glucose drops but not consistent. i thought i was at the point where i can increase calories a little more liberally now and i m not gaining weight still at 25 calories. i m just afraid of inducing refeeding syndrome. i ve also been restricting carbohydrates to 3 grams a day because i heard to keep them restricted. i don t know if this applies anymore at this stage. i also am eating low fat because gallstones were found but they are tiny so i was told they wouldn t block the duct if they pass through..but i imagine if enough passed through at once..who knows. i can t find consistent information about how to eat when you have small gallstones. any advice about any of this would be greatly appreciated. i m not sure what i should be doing at this stage and resources seem slim. no doctor in my area seems to know much about any of this and all they ve told me is that if serum phosphorus checks out, that s the only thing that matters..that does not seem accurate.",
ed recovery. hey so i m in anorexia recovery. i ve left hospital after 2 months of being an inpatient. i ve gained weight and i m following my meal plan but i hate my body. i don t want to gain more weight i m still in a pro anorexia mind set. but many people will just think i m fine because i m gaining weight. the only reason i don t want to not eat is because i would rather be anywhere but that psych ward. so i m doing everything i can to not go back to that place. i say i m pro ana but really i do have good recovery days but i don t want my weight to change. i don t think i was skinny enough anyway to receive treatment even if it s what other people saw. i m blind weighed and i m sure i m definitely in the 5 s now so i clearly don t need to be on a meal plan.,

"beyond grateful for recovery. ive been recovered for nearly a year now and its the best decision i have ever made. i enjoy and crave exercise again. my family trusts me. food is fun. im infinitely less stressed. im happy with my body even though it is imperfect. i can think straight, i can maintain friendships, i love winter. i make jokes, i laugh, i smile, i dance, i love. kayaking all summer and climbing in the fall and skiing in the winter and the world is full of joy and i love being alive. i can't express how much better every single aspect of my life is. anorexia took everything from me. it took over the entirety of my life, consumed my every thought, and stripped me of everything that makes me who i am. it destroyed my family, my health, my value system. i was a shell. and i didn't care. because it made me feel better about myself. and i figured it was worth feeling a little tired and cold sometimes. because what if i got better and hated myself again. but i had no idea. i forgot what life was supposed to feel like. i couldnt enjoy anything anymore. i dreaded any kind of movement. i was so upset with everyone around me for pushing me to get better. i was tremendously stressed at all times. my thoughts revolved entirely around food and weight and numbers. the world was black and white and i didn't even know it was supposed to be colourful. recovery is hard. it's terrifying. it feels like youre losing the only thing you have left. until it doesnt. and that time will come. the time when you know with everything inside you that it was worth it. day by day, meal by meal. find a reason you really truly care about to get better. your life, your family, your future, your friends, whatever. find something. and cling to it. i have my life back. recovery has given me everything. and its worth every damn bite.",
"average sized male starting my first recovery... horrified. i am an athletic guy and pretty average in the weight physique department i just completed an ironman however, for jeeze, must be 18 years of an eating disorder? thinking of food daily, restricting, periods of severe restriction. the underweight isn't what's making me want to recover... it's the guilty, shame and how depressed i get if i eat anything bad. i control every aspect of my food up until starting recovery this week . counting constantly every calorie. i've gone through periods of binge purge. i'm all over the place. i am eager to recover. i want to feel good about myself. i want to stop being a burden to my wife constantly asking am i fat? do i look okay? . how has recovery helped you? any men out there able to talk to me about their recovery? is it worth it? right now i am full, ate so much without counting, just eating what i want when i want, but i'm scared of becoming so disgusted with my physical appearance that it isn't worth it. sorry for the rant. i'm just scared of making the wrong decision. is recovery from ed worth the potential depression and low confidence of what i see in the mirror. does it get better.",

"i finally know my actual body type. my curves were so invisible before recovery that, at the time, i didn't know how to dress for my body. it was hard to know what would look good, one because of dysmorphia and second because i was trying to make my body fit into a mold it just wasn't made for. well, now i know i'm a bottom heavy hourglass. i look prettiest in things that accentuate my waist and make my shoulders a bit broader to balance out my lovely hips. accepting and loving this body is a challenge some days, but honestly, fashion is such a game changer for me. pants and dresses and everything in between just make me feel so pretty. it's not easy, but life is good. and i can eat cake.",
"loneliness is killing my appetite. i lost all my friends and social life to anorexia. asides from my husband and my mom, i haven t had a single person to talk to in the past 5 years. 5 years no friends , nobody to hang out with etc. people say join meetups , but they have no idea what that s like nor if that actually guarantees the possibility of making a friend. in meet ups hate to break it to anyone but often times you will not make friends. you will meet acquaintances you see here and there until they gradually fade and become messages read. plus being me, i cannot help but feel like an absolute low life at events like that without thinking how did it all get to this point ? . the thing is i have no problems talking to people but that sense of disconnection is ever present regardless. for this reason, i thought a year into recovery would magically change my life, but it didn t. did it change the psychotic reactions of my mood? yes. did it take away my suicidal ideation? less intense but not quite. did it give me any optimism that my life will get better? sorta yeah but thoughts haven t aligned with reality yet. how fucking long could someone go on without any friends? everyone wants a little affirmation, recognition, connection and i know if it weren t for my mom and husband sticking around, without a doubt i d be dead by now and i m not proud of that. at this point, i ask myself what am i alive for ? i had hobbies before anorexia; i had hobbies with anorexia . i can still engage in those hobbies now but what happens when you ve become so lonely you don t even have an interest in your hobbies anymore? idk what to do but it s hard to eat and not be hungry because you feel so empty mentally it starts to affect you physically . this is a rant . the end .",

gaining in recover. tw? hi so i went to the doctors today and i was told i need to gain weight during these next 2 weeks. i have never been told i need to gain so this is stressful especially due to me not fully committed to recovery yet. i want to get better but have very little motivation to do so right now. does anybody have any advice tips to get through this. thank you edit:modified for group rules,

"i got my period back . part of me feels vulnerable and weird about it but i m trying to focus on feeling glad that my body s getting healthier and happier. i lost my period for 2 years and after 7 months in full recovery it still hadn t come back. i was worried that something was wrong, more than i d thought. did something irreparable happen in there?? was i doing recovery right?? and then a couple days ago it came back. i was at work and i wanted to cry and felt so many conflicting feelings at once. but i had a really loving recovery win experience surrounding it yesterday that made me feel so much better and proud of the work i ve been doing. i ve been isolated a lot but yesterday i went to a friend s house and another friend drove down to join us, we had a super yummy meal and a couple beers and were just chatting. we were talking about hormones and body cycles and i blurted out guys, i got my period back yesterday after two years . i think i just wanted to share it with someone because recovery has been so fucking hard. they both knew i d been struggling with anorexia and trying to recover, and when i said that they both broke into huge smiles and gave me high fives and a big hug. they said they were so proud of me for healing my body and just celebrated with me for a minute. it made me feel so loved after being trapped alone in that secretive prison of a disease for so long. i guess i just wanted to share this because even though getting our periods back for those of us in recovery who have uteruses can be scary and conflicting and maybe even disappointing even in the midst of recovery, it can also feel empowering to know that our bodies are responding to our hard work. but there s no set timeline for amenorrhea to cease if that was part of your symptoms and you are still so valid even if you didn t lose it . it can take time for hormonal cycles to readjust. i just want to encourage you to keep going with recovery even if you don t have it back yet, you re doing great everyone s body is different and whether you ve gotten it back or not, i hope you feel proud of the work you re doing ",

binging in recovery. heyy i m truly confused about this. i don t recognise when i m hungry or not and what is physical and mental hunger. i ve read some posts that some people in recovery slipped to binge eating disorder and i m scared that s my case too. i m trying to eat more during the day but it s really hard and i don t have time for that so i end up eating more in the afternoon. but the problem is night eating. i have the mental urge to overeat at night. some days i just binge a lot. do you have the same experience with this and if yes what helped you? is this due to the restriction that i m not eating enough during the day? im really scared because i want to be at peace with food and not to develop another disorder. side note: i also think that i m still not weight restored and i should gain more weight cause i still haven t got my period back.,

i don t think recovering was worth it. i would ve preferred dying when i was super underweight than recovering. even if i now have my dream job and i can exercise and life is objectively good my mind doesn t agree and thinking about having to life the rest of my life wishing i was severely underweight again but knowing i can t do that because it will be harder to do this time and my metabolism will be ruined seems unbearable. i just want to go back to how i was but i can t because now i am eating normally and get hungry so much and if i spend too many hours without eating i get horrible headaches and nausea. my body was stronger before. that s why i feel like dying sometimes. yes i ve experienced a lot of good things since i ve recovered but i m not sure they have been worth the negative depressive episodes i ve had. sometimes i just feel like i lost my chance of dying the ideal way which is severely underweight and starving. i can t do this i can t tell my therapist anything my boyfriend doesn t take me seriously anymore when i tell him i m depressed and i have no one to tell these things to i m sorry. and i know when this mood passes i ll probably regret saying these things and guilty for not being grateful because sometimes i m happy but other times i feel like now and can t deal with life. and these mood changes happen so often idk what is wrong with me. they are so drastic.,

"could my eating disorder be getting ""smarter""?. hi everyone, i was referred to a hospital program last year for anorexia but the waitlist was so long that i ended up trying to recover at home, while seeing a therapist and dietitian. i was able to restore my weight and although i still struggled with a lot of anxiety and bdd, i felt that my eating patterns were starting to seem borderline ""normal."" there was even a point mid april of this year when i felt myself having healthier thoughts about my body, weight, and clothes, and breaking many of my food rules without anxiety. amp; x2 b; at that time i was following a meal plan insofar as i was eating at specific times each day and paying attention to food groups, but it was fairly general. i trusted it and felt good physically and mentally. then around the end of april i noticed i was forgetting about some of my eating times, or skipping the last one due to genuinely not being hungry. this was very new for me as i'm someone who has always struggled with food obsession when i'm engaging in ed behaviours. over time things got worse, to the point that right now and for about a month and a half i feel nauseous when i even think about food. nothing at all appeals to me and i don't feel any physical hunger. i thought it was anxiety at first, or a symptom of covid which i had in april and it had some lasting effects , but my husband suggested it might be a new way the anorexia has found to take hold of me. amp; x2 b; the reason i struggle with this explanation is because it is truly so unfamiliar for me to not want food, even when i've been at my ""most anorexic."" this sensation seems entirely physical, and i know psychosomatic symptoms can be very strong, but i don't have any prior experience with physical symptoms from anxiety or depression. is it possible i'm outsmarting myself because i got too ""good"" at recovering the way i was doing it? the last thing i want is to go back to the way i was before, and so although it doesn't feel like my ed to me, i don't want to risk it. has this happened to anyone else, or have you heard of this happening? thank you so much in advance. tldr; felt close to recovering from anorexia and completely lost appetite",

"can t stop fixating on fluid retention ugg. hey y all, i ve probably said this in here before but man the edema bugs me. it makes me feel heavy and like i m never going to drop the water. for context i m male and i ve been all in for 7 months with maybe 2 3 minor relapses and haven t had a relapse at all in several months. i love food and am no longer afraid of it. i don t weigh myself but i ve definitely weight stabilized, and it appears maybe even slowly some of the water is starting to taper off but sometimes i feel like it never will. hilariously i find myself wishing i could replace the water with fat, because water is so tight and uncomfortable and limits mobility so much. a friend of mine who recovered long ago said to up my salt. that the doctors in mexico told her that and that she dropped the water afterwards. from my research on minerals and salt, this actually bears out too little salt can lead to edema actually more than too much so long as you drink enough water your kidneys will pee out any excess salt and considering we have upped our amount of food, perhaps the salt isn t sufficient to support the amount we re eating. i dunno, does anyone have any suggestions or experience with this? even just telling me to be patient is appreciated lol, i just need to be reminded it s a normal part of recovery for some people.",

"still gaining weight 2 years into anorexia recovery??. i had anorexia for 4 years, from age 16 17 to 2 . i started my recovery in the spring of 2 2 , went through extreme hunger etc, and gained a lot of weight about 25 kg initially. that was fine, i was okay with it, i knew it was part of the process. my weight had more or less stabilized and i was at 85kg for a long time. last year however, for a few months i lost some of the weight and went down to maybe 75kg. this wasn t intentional and was because i was so busy and active that i guess i wasn t eating as much as i needed. after this however, my weight went back to 85kg and was stable at around this weight again. however, in the last 2 months i ve noticed i started gaining weight again. i tried not to freak out about it, and hadn t weighed myself for the past few weeks, but tonight i finally did and have discovered i m now at 89kg. i have to admit, i m pretty upset about it. my bras and clothes are starting to not fit me. i don t have the energy or mental capacity right now to go buy myself an entire new wardrobe. i don t know what s happening or why my weight is suddenly shooting up again. i m just feeling very lost and confused. i think i eat pretty intuitively, like i eat when i m hungry and i stop when i m full. i also eat a bit of junk food or sweets sometimes when i m craving it, but it s not all the time. i just don t know wtf is going on. i m eating the same way i have been from the beginning of my recovery, and from when my weight was stabilized at 85kg. there are only 3 things i can think of that might possibly contribute to weight gain?? 1. i have been taking wellbutrin for the past few months. but i don t know why it would only kick in with the weight gain now instead of 3 4 months ago when i first started taking it? 2. my meals were pretty irregular these past few months. i was fasting without really intending to, because i m depressed and would wake up and not have the energy or motivation to make myself a big breakfast or to feed myself super regularly during the day time. but, i d eat a lot at night and by the end of the day always felt satisfied not still starving . however, i have since fixed how i m feeding myself and am eating breakfast and lunch every single day, and not unintentionally fasting, and eating larger portions for breakfast and lunch so that i m not starving in the evening. 3. i did a parasite cleanse this past week in the hopes that it might help me with my ibs. it made me feel super out of it for the first few days, but now i m feeling all normal again. i know parasite cleanses can release heavy metals from the dying worms, they tend to hold on to heavy metals and i have heard before that when the body is faced with toxins that it can t process right away, it tries to store it in fat gain fat in order to put it away somewhere safe that won t damage the body. besides these reasons, could it just be the natural process of recovery? has anyone else experienced this, where your weight suddenly shot up in the middle of your recovery out of the blue? if so, how long did it last how long did your recovery ultimately last afterwards? i m trying to be patient with my body but i m just so tired of living like this. it s exhausting having to manage my body image issues, shopping for clothing, etc. all that while i am struggling with bad mental health issues and a ton of issues in my family. i also have serious body dysmorphia, so this is triggering me a lot. not to mention, it s almost impossible for me to find clothes in my size because i live in asia and everything here is made for tiny people i grew up here and am living with my family atm . thank you to anyone for your help input or if you can share your story and give me some hope while i m feeling super lost and distraught.",

"need to admit something. so i discovered i had anorexia through being diagnosed with adrenal fatigue with a lot of insomnia involved and then putting the dots together to figure out the cause was anorexia. been recovering for 7 months, the edema is nuts. i have been supplementing with sea salt because i think from all of my not eating my body was just stripped of salt, so i figured out probably 18 months ago or so that salt helped me sleep. but out of my desire to get rid of the edema i cut the salt i was supplementing. my sleep has been trash and my anxiety higher, until finally last night and tonight now insomnia has hit. i attribute this decision to anorexia brain the need to manipulate something to exert control over my body. i think also to some degree it was innocently trying something new because the edema seemed unhealthy. in any event i realize that the real thing to do is to maybe dial the salt back a bit because perhaps i was right that it was too much, but not to cut it out completely. and also to drink more water. it scares me to reintroduce salt supplementation because i m not wanting to balloon up again. but i need to trust the process and that also, perhaps just drinking enough water and finding a happy medium with the salt will help me find a healthy spot to be at to heal without having to control what that looks like. i definitely think the amount of salt that i was adding before this is in addition to what s in my food, i ve never cut salt from my food was too much because the water i mixed it in started to taste like shit which if you believe in listening to your body that s something that same amount used to taste good to me but the body has probably healed and changed and needs less again not zero . however tonight i added salt supp back in and it was about half of what i used to do and i could hardly taste it. any way, mistakes will be made, it s not the end of the world but it feels good to let it out.",

"i need help, i don't know where to start. hi im male 26 i started dating a girl 24 a few months ago. i suspected that she was anorexic bassed on how little she actually eats on dates and meals we cook together. last night she opened up to me and confirmed that she was in fact anorexic. she has struggled with it since she was 4 and has been in rehab twice for it and the emergency room countless times. the old me would be wanting to fix it right away, but iv learned i can't take that mindset. i wanna help her but not take on a savior complex i do like her and i could see us going long term but i'm worried on how i can best support her, and help her stay healthy. any and all advice you have to help me learn about anorexia, how i can best support her, questions i should ask her, the reality of being in a relationship with someone who has anorexia, and anything you think someone in my possession should know about would be great. thanks ",
"anorexia recovery and weird relationship with food. i have had anorexia since i was 13 years old. now i am 21. i learnt to accept my body and i am not looking to look like a skeleton anymore. but there's one weird thing that i noticed about my behavior. i hate to cook for people for example at family parties i try to stay away from the kitchen, i just don't like when people see me there . when my boyfriend asks me to cook something for him in a lovely way ofc i do it but i usually feel ashamed when cooking. the other thing is that i cannot stand eating asmr sounds, or when i talk with my bae on phone and i hear him drinking something. i am just getting very nervous and i wanna stop hearing that rn. has anyone experienced such thing while recovering?",

"new, confused and nervous. hi everyone. i m new here, 29f, but honestly i m not sure if i belong here. i have struggled on and off with periods of hating my body, restricting my calories, and obsessing over my weight. it started in 2 18 when i was 25. my whole life i had been tiny and chronically underweight due to having been born severely premature at 26 weeks. my entire childhood was focused on getting me to eat more and gain weight so i could grow. by the time i reached my adult height i had stabilized my weight, but was still classed as underweight to a not insignificant degree. it was in my mid 2 s when i first noticed that i had started to gain weight, and was now classed as having a normal bmi, albeit at the very bottom end of normal. for some reason this terrified me. it was like for the first time in my life, i realized that i was just as susceptible to getting fat as everyone else, and i started significantly reducing my caloric intake and weighed myself obsessively, multiple times a day. i eventually dropped back to the weight i had been at during adolescence, and i felt better and stopped restricting. of course my weight went back up, and in 2 2 the panic set in again and i went back to restricting. again i returned to my baseline weight, and felt better and stopped the restriction. i m now back two years later, having the same struggles as before with hating my body, being terrified of gaining weight and carefully monitoring my calories while keeping daily track of my weight. this time though, the voices in my head are more insidious than they have been in the past. previously i had been satisfied with my adolescent weight, but now they re telling me to push it just a little farther, to see just how far i can go. i m aware of the dangers of losing too much weight, but my brain is telling me that what i want doesn t count as too much, and i m having trouble knowing what to believe. i spoke to my therapist about all of this this afternoon, and she said i could be considered diagnosable for anorexia. i m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that i could have an eating disorder, because my symptoms don t seem that serious . i m scheduled to speak to a nutritionist next week, and i m terrified at the thought of her telling me i need to stop restricting my food intake. earlier this week one of my other therapists asked me to do her a favor and increase my caloric intake back to a level that would sustain my current low normal weight at least until i speak to the nutritionist, and i had a panic attack. i m just very confused right now, i don t know if my current predicament is serious, and i don t know what to do to make the angry voices in my head telling me i need to lose weight go away, if it turns out this is a problem. i don t really know why i made this post, i guess i just needed some people to talk to who ve been through it, and who could reassure me that i m not crazy. thank you to everyone who made it this far.",
insomnia in recovery?. is this a normal thing cuz i can t get myself to fall asleep no matter how hard i try amp; its literally 5:3 am rn,
"i don't know where i am right now. so..i've been in some kind of recovery for the past 9 months, i gained a bit and classify as 'normally underweight' at the moment. i mean, i feel like shit. i feel worthless, my bpd symptoms are getting worse and worse, depression has been hitting me pretty hard, especially while i was trying to get off my addiction to benzos..the worst thing is, i gained a lot and lost a lot of weight this month and it's obviously confusing to see my body change from one thing to another in a span of 4 weeks. i don't know if i need to vent or get advice at this point. i started not going to school again and i deeply wish to be able to restrict again as i don't feel like myself at all. i started triggering myself after my bf had to leave for school last sunday he's going to a boarding school about 1 1 2 hours away as i was reminded of a trauma through the fact he's going on his final drive and will be even more far away. it's so hard to realise he's not my ex, which left me cold turkey for 3 weeks, after we were together everyday for 1 1 2 years,to go to poland with his family, telling me he knew since yesterday, that his grandma was sick, ect ect. oh and his phone broke, so he couldn't contact me during his holiday while he was partying with his uncle on coke, meth and whatever else he took. i don't wanna know. all i know is that i almost died in these weeks last year. and i guess this triggered me. i didn't realise what my feelings were about since yesterday, but it's still hard to deal with. i didn't go psycho this time and distanced myself at first, because i know how hard it is to understand what i'm feeling when i'm in an episode like that and i truly don't want to hurt him. he's too precious to me to ever be abusive or mean or anything else to him and i promised i was going to get better. our sole priority is to be healthier, this is our goal and i love how much good we're doing to each other. but i started lacking. i know it's not really my fault, but there were 2 incidents on may 1st. both in which i got sexually used or absued and it's tearing me apart. i don't even know how many times this has happened until now. i'm not in therapy anymore, but i immediately looked for help after all of this went down. yesterday i've had an appointement at a womens counseling centre with our school pedagogue and it was amazing but i'm still overeating like crazy and everything feels so heavy. my head is spinning around all these responsibilities. school, work, friends and a relationship..damn that's hard to manage. and besides from all that chaos is me. my doc just told me i'm overworked and need to rest. because of all the work i did in the last few months i may as well will have chronic pains in my right arm, which i painfully had to accept after wrting 4 double pages of vocabulary yesterday.. but as all of this is going down, i can't seem to rest. i've been thinking about hurting myself or even ending my life, because i can't take it anymore. i'm trying so hard. i don't want to be addicted, i don't want to hate myself, i don't want to fail in school, i don't wanna leave my job and stay at home again. i'm done feeling like this and i know i'm the only one that's able to change this, but as hard as i try, i can't even be honest. sometimes i physically couldn't speak even when i tried to. on that sunday, last week, i had a panic anxiety attack and it's getting worse. for about 1 15 minutes, i was frozen. when i finally woke up, it took me another few minutes to move my fingers and then a bit of my body again. all of this is scaring me. i'm always on edge. i don't know if anyone can explain something to me about this situation or give any tips on how to deal with trauma reactions. even some nice words are greatly appreciated. i hope y'all are getting better, i don't wish anyone to feel this way.",

"ed not prioritised in my psychiatric treatment. hello all, this is my first time posting in this subreddit but i ve been following along for a while and really admire how supportive and open of a community this is as i ve seen ed and anorexia spaces online just breed a lot of harm. i am 22 transmasculine, but present in quite a gender non confirming way idk i say this because dysphoria was so much wrapped up in my dysmorphia of trying to disappear my body and it feels relevant somehow, how people perceive my body to what i have to share. i have long hair and i m african and not really interested in passing as a cisman at this point though i am on t and my soul tinges every time a stranger refers to me as lady... in any case. i do feel like across the gender spectrum thinness is generally lauded as desirable and since low body fat de emphasises and a shift in my fat distribution subdues body features associated more with the feminine i feel like i get social positive affirmation to stay thin. at this point in my recovery, i m out of college after it drove me to psychosis, and am at a healthy weight meaning according to my blood work my organs are all functioning. however, partially due to my stimulant medication and never actually instating regular patterns of eating ? i do not eat most days or really an amount that is severely under daily recommended minimum but it is not out of an active desire to restrict it is just kind of routine. i also work out quite intensely 4 6 days a week for about an hour fifteen. i have a low body fat percentage but because of my muscle mass i am not underweight. i still feel strong impulses to control how i look especially due to the positive reception i have received for my body from others trans and queer people. but i do not want to live like this. i want to be able to feed myself and eat and have some energy and semblance of regularity. i don t want to use food as a place of self denial. i am currently in intensive treatment for a different. psychiatric disorder and when i talk to my care team about my ed i feel like they don t take me seriously i have been in the outpatient programme for over six months and now one has given me a referral for a nutritionist even after i explicitly asked my psychiatrist. does anyone resonant with any of this do you have any advice ?",

"i forgive myself. i hope everyone s well. i just wanted to make a post about something that s helped me significantly through the mental health portion of recovery. for the past year i ve been recovering from anorexia very slowly. i ve been battling my body thinking the pain, swelling, and exhaustion is wrong and is not supposed to happen. i ve tried eating a variety of different ways thinking i must be doing something wrong, but i ve finally come to the realization that my body is supposed to do this and i can t stop this, nor should i. it s trying to heal. and i must accept and submit to it. most importantly i must forgive myself for what i ve done to myself. anorexia is an illness that doesn t allow you to think clearly, i ve made some wildly irrational food decisions because of this. it doesn t make me stupid, it doesn t mean i m bad or dumb or have ruined my life. millions of people have experienced this same thing that i have. i m so grateful for this forum, i m so grateful for everyone whose shared their story and given me advice. and i hope you too can forgive yourself. take care everyone, you deserve all the self care and compassion in the world.",

"rant: nightmares and struggling without adhd meds. a little over a month ago, i was taken off of my adhd meds which i didn't fully realize were a kind of big contributor to my ed. for the most part, it was kind of an unintentional ed, combined with a lot of eating issues i had post covid suddenly allergic to some foods, many foods tasting different and bad, so having to force myself to eat random things that are tolerable . i was originally taken off due to concerns i expressed over cardiac health. i did a holter monitor for 48 hours and no problems were found. but my doctor never discussed with me an alternative treatment for my adhd, nor has the topic of going back on my meds come up. sometimes i want to ask about going back on meds, other times i'm like, nah, no meds is good for you. mostly, being off any meds has been... weird. like, some days i find i function pretty okay, other days it's like i'm lost in space. and in terms of recovery, there were days i was miserable when i was totally unable to gain weight, in constant physical discomfort pain so some days i'm glad to be gaining and then the other days... well, the other days are the reason for this post: the bad days seem to be getting worse. the other night, i literally woke up crying because i had a dream or i guess nightmare where i was getting ready for work like usual and before heading out the door, looked in my full length mirror and i had gained a bunch of weight and i had huge elephant like legs?? i literally said horrible insults to myself in my dream and thats when i woke up in tears. as a result, i found myself yesterday being hyper critical about eating and wound up restricting. i mean, what the hell???? i'm in my mid twenties and dealt with anorexia when i was in high school too, and never did i have a nightmare that was obviously my sub conscious freaking out about eating or gaining. in terms of mental illness relating to the ed, i'm way more fucked up over the recovery process than i was throughout the whole time i kept losing weight, since it was almost all unintentional. it's only now i realize it actually was an illness and not just ""la dee da, long covid making food suck, whoopsie i'm losing weight "" i don't know if i'm making any sense here. i guess what i'm wondering is, has anyone else had these weird nightmares? and has anyone else had the kind of weird journey of unintentional weight loss followed by a very unsettled and fear stricken recovery process? i just feel so frustrated and so alone and weird and sometimes i feel... not valid? like, some people do really extreme tactics and i just... had zero appetite or deadass forgot to eat for days. it's fucking weird and i feel weird and i hate everything and i'm really struggling to avoid deliberate restriction.",

"the ed brain and large crowds trigger anyone else experience this?. this monday i had my grad school graduation and expected all to go well because i ve been weight restored for 7 months , psychotic symptoms have subsided completely, and i only get intrusive thoughts here and there and in no way feel like the ravaged starved animal that i used to be. however, monday proved otherwise and i m beginning to understand much like this illness is a lot deeper than a desire to lose weight, so is the abstract nature of a recovery from it, i.e,any disorder of the brain would have symptoms that persist regardless of engagement in behaviors associated with it. for me, i still cannot handle large crowds . i used to cry at big events because i couldn t understand why everyone was so happy while i just felt like a loser. that feeling came back intensely on monday. i felt inferior to everyone around me as if everyone was secretly making fun of me. i didn t experience this until my 4th year of being underweight and since the body has a memory, i suppose those same intense feelings of inferiority came back in full force for my grad school graduation . i ve tried to understand why it happens . sometimes i think there must be some kind of distortion in spacial perspective with an ed that causes me to think i m taking up too much space even if i m not conscious of it , so large crowds make me feel fatter ; other times i ve thought maybe because body image distortions are so bad with anorexia, i get fixated on comparing myself way too much to others, and the larger the crowd,the more comparisons . finally i wonder if unconsciously my mind is not yet out of starvation mode and still has to view social relations from the lens of predator vs prey and some mechanism in my body increases cortisol anytime it s in large crowds. anyone else experience this ?",

"lunch with a friend with ed. i 17f have a friend 16f who suffers from anorexia. she s coming over for lunch and a study session to escape her family who apparently has been forcing her to eat since they found out about her ed. i don t want to force had to eat but i don t want to facilitate her not doing so. i asked my cousin for advice and she suggested i don t force her but instead i create an environment where she would feel the need to eat or something like that. any advice? mainly about foods i could cook order? sorry about possible mistakes, english isn t my first language for context: i ve met her about a year ago when i changed schools. she s always been very skinny and i never saw her eat during break we don t have lunch at school in my country , so i already understood something was up but i never confronted her about it as i didn t know her very well. luckily, due to some circumstances, she opened up to me and this other friend of mine 17f about her anorexia. me and my other friend always made sure we created a safe environment for her to feel loved and comfortable so that she would come to us when she needed anything and eventually help her seek professional help. a few months ago, after a little breakdown she had after a test that went bad because her struggle got in the way of her studying properly i managed to convince her to talk to one of our teachers who is know to help students with both non mental health and mental health related issues. thanks to the help of this teacher and other happenings, she finally made up her mind and about a month ago the teacher talked to her parents and she started going to a therapist. the therapy just started so i don t know if she already started recovery or not but i do know that she feels overwhelmed mainly because of her family making comments about her not eating or studying. her mom also texted my other friend to see if she eats and we don t know what to tell her. so now she says she s coming because her mom wanted her to go have lunch with her cousins and uncles and she says she just wants to stay with me and this other friend because we are the only people making her feel good in this hard times. i m glad she feels comfortable with her issue around us, but i don t want the fact that she feels comfortable with us to be an excuse for her ed not to eat. i told her it would be just the three of us eating so she won t have to worry about my parents but that since we ll be preparing something she should eat if possible but not to worry because no one will force her. i was thinking maybe i should cook something light so that it will ease her more than something more caloric but idk. edit: so we had lunch and she didn t eat anything but it s ok for me as long as she still feels comfortable and knows me and my friend are there for her when she needs us. i wanted to clarify that i m not too worried on the whole situation as she already has a main source of help from the therapist and i already know she s a very strong person so eventually she ll manage to overcome this. i mainly wanted to use this as an occasion to inform myself on the topic, as i don t have many people to talk to about mental health related subjects in my life and i want to know what is the best way to support her as her friend. thanks everyone for the advice they gave, it really helps.",

"recovery communities focused on building actual healthy relationships w food?. not this all in, if your body craves a box of oreos eat a box of oreos, it s ok to be fat, listen to your body bs i m seeing everywhere. i just want to be ok eating a normal amount of healthy food and maintaining a normal weight and that does not seem to be supported in many online spaces. i guess the answer is to not be in online spaces full of hungry young ppl with no medical knowledge and seek out and build a life outside my ed. but i just feel very alone and like it s impossible to find a healthy middle ground. going from bed to an to bn to an bp means an unrestricted approach would not work for me.",
"possible relapse?. is it possible to relapse and not be aware? i ve been in recovery for years. almost 5 to be exact. i ve done really good. been at a healthy weight, enough exercise that wasn t extreme, was happy with how healthy i looked. then i had my second child and all of that changed. i hated my body for a long time. he s a year old now. i got over that a few months ago. but i stepped on the scale the other day and i am currently 13lbs under my heathy goal weight. i wasn t even aware i was losing weight. sometimes i don t have time to eat a bunch, but i try to eat when i can. i mean i have missed a meal here and there but i thought nothing of it. i m almost under 1 lbs. the last time i went under it was bad. i looked deathly ill. so now i m stressing about what i ll look like if i gain the weight back, and still stressing about being way under weight. i didn t even realize i was slipping until i saw the numbers.",
"sex and anorexia are incompatible even in recovery.. when i was at my lowest lowest weight, i could not even think of sex nor understand why people did it . for me, the entire action was repulsive and i couldn t even feel horny in the slightest way largely because my estrogen levels were abnormally low and my thyroid was all out of whack . from 2 17 2 19, i had sex with my husband 6 times at best. but lo and behold, i ve been at a healthy weight for 5 months now; i do get horny and think about sex but still i seldomly engage in the act . it takes a great confidence and connection to one s body to fuck someone else s body whether one is conscious of it or not . since restoring my weight, i just feel like a blob fish who cannot identify with what it sees in the mirror so sex is hard. for the past 7 years, i cannot have sex sober and it remains the same now. if i m not high off weed or alcohol, or molly which i do very rarely but is the most enjoyable , i cannot have sex. touch is foreign to me. i do not want to be touched. of course i know i enjoy having sex as a way to bring me closer to the person i love although that s not the notion mainstream society affixes on sex at all . but still i d like to feel desirable before the act but that can t happen at all unless i m high . does this get any better as time goes on in recovery or will i always be like this? note i was almost entirely asexual as a teenager too . all my life, i couldn t understand it ... it might just be the natural wiring of my ed brain .",
"anyone else dreading this summer ? i need support and sorry for this long rant.... i wanted to wear dresses this summer, shorts, crop tops, and skirts to celebrate the fact i'm healthy now but i just seem to hate myself all the more. i used to think all my anorexic thoughts would disappear once i managed to eat over 3,5 a day and gained back all my weight...well, it's been 11 months, i have no desire to restrict but holy shit, it's as if i'm still anorexic but just one who rejects all behaviors now and hates herself for ever having anorexia in the first place . i've been weight restored since november after battling an for 1 years 16 26 years old . my body has changed a lot in recovery and it's changed in ways that i did not expect. i longed for a curvy, womanly body as someone whose spent all their adult life resembling a kid but i didn't get that body; instead what i have now is a teenager's body with extra weight on it, one that looks as if it's just entering puberty... i know things will even out in time or maybe not at all but how do i cope with summer coming along when i'll be constantly bombarded by women who have perfect bodies ? i know this is my ed talking but it's so hard for me not to feel ugly and worthless. i am still flat chested, i have some hips and thighs now, but the wideness of my mid section all the weight went there mainly makes it hard to notice any curves. plus with rib flare from anorexia, my ribs still pop out even at a healthy weight so i just find all of me to look incredibly weird. i didn't think it would get this hard, but within my 11 months of recovery, i have realized this : a healthy weight does not equate to a healthy mind nor does anorexia just revolve around starving and obsessing about weight. it is a disorder of mind with a disconnection from the body. it's a disorder of intense self hate and constant inferiority. it's a disorder of no self worth . i do not restrict anymore and i have not even weighed myself at all these past 11 months except at doctor's appointments, but still i feel a deep disgust with myself for not only having anorexia in the first place but constantly wondering what my body would've been like if i never developed it at all... i know i did damage ; i know the way my body looks now is a result of it trying to heal from that damage but will i ever just feel a semblance of confidence or acceptance or is this just the remnants of the disorder that i'll have to fight all my life ? it sucks.",
"best aka least gross lmao nutrition shakes?. hello hello i'm hoping to up some of my calorie intake with nutrition shakes drinks unfortunately, however, literally every single one i've tried is the worst thing i've ever tasted. : picky eating turned ed will be my downfall lmao do you have any you would recommend that don't have a fake sugar aftertaste? that's the worst for me. so far, the chocolate soylent has been the best for me, but i've stopped with that because the weird aftertaste just became too much. i've also considered mixing them with something that tastes better. has anyone tried that? like, mixing the chocolate soylent into real chocolate milk, or mixing the fruit drinks they give cancer patients into actual juice? like the clear ensure i've never had it, i'm too worried about spending money on something that i won't be able to drink because of a fake taste i feel like a dog who has to have their medicine hid in peanut butter lmao",
"eating less as a way to ""safe money"". i was anorexic for a long time and i still have the mindset. it kind of mixed with the whole ""i need to have total control over my life"" mindset, and undereating gave me the feeling of control. yeah, its actually ana having control, but thats just how mental illnesses work right now i have a lot of problems with my finances, i tend to overspend because of my bpd and an easy way to safe money after i overspend is to lower my food costs by just undereating. but of course, that isn't a good or healthy way of thinking. how do you guys manage to eat enough and spend money on food even when money is tight? because, as for me, eating is something ""unnecessary"" i can easily cut costs on.",

"did anyone have gerd acid reflux then heal it?. i was wondering if any of you were diagnosed with gerd or heartburn problems during after refeeding and what treatment you got for it. i am a year into recovery and re feed myself with unrestricted eating. last december, i had a severe chronic cough and vomited involuntarily multiple times a week. i thought this was just side effects of refeeding so i didn t see doctor until last week. i was taking an h2 blocker twice a day before i saw her. then she prescribed me a ppi prilosec for 14 days in the morning with h2 blocker at night. the idea is hopefully after 14 days of treatment, my stomach will be healed enough from the acid to go on normally. she also sent me handouts for gerd and heartburn. some of the advice is to avoid certain foods, but to put it bluntly i will not be ever doing that because i know i am not ready to do any sort of diet modifications without it eventually turning into more harmful restrictions. and frankly, i don t want to give up foods. so did any of you get treated for gerd or heartburn? what did your treatment look like? how long did it take for symptoms to resolve? thank you edit: i will add that my question is more aimed at people in long term recovery 8 months or more of all in recovery, not quasi recovery . i have seen an eating disorder coach the lovely tabitha farrar and she said after a year of all in recovery, my vomitting and acid issues are probably caused by something else. which is discouraging. and that s why i wanted to know if any of you have these issues still with long term recovery.",
"how do you help yourself get an appetite?. i'm 28f and have suffered from each extreme form of eating disorders since i was 13. recently i stopped drinking alcohol which i used as a way to kickstart my desire to eat more than anything else but i was getting to a point of alcoholism and decided to stop. well at first i was pretty hungry the first few days and ate a lot. but day 4 i just haven't had desire to eat, it's now day 15 and i have no desire to eat or even drink liquids very much but i force the liquid down. i try to force food down but my throat closes up and i just can't swallow or if i do get it down it gets stuck halfway and i start choking. the past 2 weeks i've lost a lot of weight due to not being able to eat and when i do its only a couple bites. it's hard because my fiance has been going above and beyond to make or get me things he knows i usually love only for it to go to waste. i've been to counseling and have gotten medication over the years but it just doesn't help. on the 3 th i have a really fancy dinner planned with my fiance and i don't know what to do. i'm scared i won't be able to eat and enjoy the food that we have never had together before. my mind and body has just gotten so used to lack of food that i don't even realize how long it's been since i last ate... i want to get my appetite back without use of alcohol i do smoke bud too, but it doesn't give me the munchies like others ",

"struggling with digestive issues after an ed? consider getting tested for imo.. imo intestinal methanogen overgrowth. a few months ago, i was diagnosed with a tough case of this, which i believe started with my restrictive eating habits as a teenager. imo can bloat you, make you constipated, nauseated, and make it feel like your intestinal motility is slowed. a couple ways to get tested are through sibo small intestinal bacterial overgrowth breath testing, or test like genova's gi effects that check for methanobrevibacter smithii in the large intestine. just thought i would spread the word in case others are going through something similar. treatment isn't easy, but it can get better. i'll put studies and resources for further reading in the comments. i've also been researching for months since so few non functional or naturopathic doctors seem to be that well aware of the condition and what it does to you, so i'm happy to help answer questions if you have any.",

"recovering seems impossible. like most people, my anorexia started at a young age when i was 14, even though i was already considered underweight. it started with innocent things like trying to ""diet"" and eat less calorie dense food which led to me passing out and quitting the diet . i didn't even realize it was anorexia creeping in at the time. i've always heard of people having eating disorders, but i feel like i was oblivious for a really long time that i was suffering from one too. i really only realized by late last year that these habits the body checking, the restricting, never finishing my food, comparing my body to others, grabbing my ""fats"", the super intense fear of gaining weight, feeling good that other people were saying i looked liked bones had to be from an eating disorder. it's always been bad but this year it really took a turn for the worse. i am perpetually exhausted, skipping meals, easily irritated, my ribcage and spines are somewhat prominently showing, and im not even able to enjoy my meal outside with friends and family. i even have calories of most food that i eat imprinted on my mind. it was making my life really miserable and i knew in my heart that i could be so much happier if i was able to eat what i wanted... the wakeup call for me was when my friend passed away recently. it made me realize that life is so fragile and i am spending everyday thinking and worrying about food when i could be trying to make the most of it. it made me feel so pathetic and i felt so sad for myself. i really tried multiple times since then to recover. i keep hyping myself up, telling myself that i can do it and reminding myself of how much happier i will be after. but after awhile, my resolve starts to dwindle and i relapse everytime. i havent gotten very far with restoring any weight at all. i guess i just badly need advice right now. how do i actually start recovery even if its one small step at a time? the all or nothing approach to recovery makes me feel too scared and anxious so i was wondering if there were any small tips that could push me in the right direction, or even any words of encouragement and similar experiences : i know i could badly use a therapist to help but my parents told me to stop going to therapy the last time i went for my depression because the fees were too expensive for us. i feel really hopeless, like i'll have to live with this illness till i die, but i feel so exhausted of this body and it's getting harder and harder to even get up and do basic tasks because i don't have the energy to... i see people eating and having healthy relationship with food and their bodies and i feel so envious. im beginning to think that i should accept living like this for the rest of my life because of how many times i've failed...",

"today marks one year of my anorexia recovery . one year ago, i went all in with my anorexia recovery. with no slip ups the entire time. despite being so sad and terrified at the thought of leaving my comfort zone. i had anorexia nervosa for 15 years as young as age 12, so it has been so hard pushing back against everything i ever knew. but it was worth it. it was worth every anxiety provoking moment and every triggering moment from stupid doctors who don t know shit about anorexia nervosa and dumb ignorant people who would make pregnancy comments because of my very prominent recovery belly. there were even tears especially in the beginning months, but i fucking did it. a year ago, almost every one of my ribs showed and i had a very concave stomach. now for the first time ever i no longer fit in children s clothing. shopped in the women s section for the first time in my life as a 27 year old woman a few days ago. recovery was sooo hard for me because i was most insecure about my stomach that i starved myself to the point of my stomach completely disappearing without realizing how severe it got. and as a consequence i got a large recovery belly that made me feel awful. but it s starting to feel empowering. my thoughts were ridiculous during the eating disorder since i never had much of a stomach, but now i see that life is not terrible even when i do have a bigger stomach. that worry was all in my head. my body image is a work in progress but i feel better about myself each day. not to mention the health benefits: my hair grew back, lower blood pressure, no more anxiety, better sleep, i can actually concentrate, i no longer feel like passing out multiple times a day, etc. the biggest thought that kept me going at 1 every single day for a year was that the sooner i go in, the sooner it will all be over. i didn t have faith in the process at the beginning, but now i completely do. since i ve starved since i was a preteen for 15 years and became skin and bones, my recovery timeline and overshoot gains were greater than average. despite my path being longer than most, i am so looking forward to living a life 1 free of the eating disorder. i got through the first year without ever slipping up despite it being the hardest thing i ve ever done. nothing can stop me now ",

working out to get rid of my recovery belly because i think i ll never get my original shape back ?. i don t think i m on the brink of a relapse but i know i am feeling miserable about what weight restoration did to my shape. i have no defined waist now and i feel as if my shape has become disproportionately square with my trunk storing more fat than my hips so it just looks weird overall . i have a muffin top now and no clothes can really hide it . i have been weight restored for the past 3 4 months after having anorexia for 1 years ages 17 26 and a half . i know long term anorexia might ve permanently stunted my sex hormones plus overall development of a womanly physique . i also know that the fat went mostly to my mid section to protect my major organs . but i suspect in my case the weight gain will not redistribute because i had this hellhole of an illness for too long and now i m just left hating my body even more than when i started restricting . so should i continue doing ab workouts to get rid of the enormous fat deposits on my mid section or is that fat necessary to guarantee total internal recovery which will naturally redistribute once the body reaches homeostasis ? i just hate myself for starving as long as i did now.,

"ketamine keto anorexia remission in new study. i post frequently in the r therapeuticketamine subreddit. new research was presented at the international ketamine journal conference in oxford, england. i was able to attend the conference online. study participants with anorexia nervosa were supervised on a keto diet for one month and then started treatment with 6 ketamine infusions over 3 weeks. a significant number of participants experienced remission of symptoms. in animal models it is postulated that anorexia symptoms were an evolutionary advantage for some individuals in a population related to food scarcity triggering behavior changes and migration to new areas with greater resources. in a study with black lab rats, food scarcity resulted in a small percentage of female rats decreasing food intake, increasing physical activity, and displaying increased anxiety behavior. i am a provider that treats mainly anxiety, depression, and ptsd with sublingual ketamine. the response rate to ketamine in the general population is 5 6 . these study results will be published within the next two months. this may revolutionize the treatment of anorexia nervosa. here is a similar case report. https: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc7412264 https: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc7412264 ",

eating with friends i need support amp; advice . i went out to eat with a new somewhat close friend for the first time at a restaurant since i started recovery 8 months ago at olive garden and i got anxious and i feel like i ruined the dinner. i'm proud i didn't have an anxiety attack and i calmed myself down but she told me i was making her anxious about eating before i told her i had an issue eating because i kept looking away from my food between eating because i was anxious about the portion of food at first even if the pasta was delicious. after i told her i had trouble with food at the dinner she was really nice and didn't make me feel bad and asked if i wanted to leave or if i wanted something else but i told her it was fine. we finished eating and it was really nice despite the fact i feel embarrassed that i feel like i ruined the experience for her even if after i calmed down we both had a nice time talking about bread sticks and joking around a bit. we live next to each other in uni apartments and the walls are thin and i overheard her the next day telling her mom that she is pretty sure i have anorexia after the dinner and that she was going to stay here and skip going home to make sure i was eating with her because she cares about me and she almost cried talking to her saying i was her best friend here and she thought i was really cool and was worried about me and her mom who i have known for a few months was worried too. i feel a bit upset at myself i made my friend cry. she went on the trip to see her family a few hours away and is coming back soon. i texted her a few days after she left telling her i had anorexia and that i was okay and in recovery it's just restaurants because of eating around so many people can make me anxious and she said she suspected i might have had an ed but didn't say anything but that she was happy i was in recovery. i am a bit underweight and we have been ordering food and hanging out together at her place for a few months now. everything is back to normal in our friendship but i still feel guilty. i want to push myself to eat out more but i still feel a tiny bit uncomfortable eating around close friends but i think i can do it. does anyone have any advice on dealing with anxiety when eating with friends in public? i am 21 and i went hermit during my teen years then lost my early college years to covid and i really don't want my ed to make me lose friends or the ability to go out. also if anyone replies please use only they them pronouns to refer to me. i am non binary and my name is torri : ,

"thoughts on maternity clothes during recovery?. i am now a year into recovery after having anorexia nervosa for 15 years. at my lowest weight, i had a very concave stomach. which is ironic because i was the most insecure about my stomach by far, to the point that it took me a long time to realize the stomach i always thought was too big actually disappeared. so as a consequence, i have a very prominent recovery belly after the refeeding period since a lot of healing needs to be done in my midsection. i have only bought 1 pair of yoga pants this whole year for clothing, so now i think it s time for me to buy new clothes. i got by using old clothes that used to either be way too big or fit very loosely. since my body is currently shaped so similarly to a third trimester pregnant woman s, i ve considered buying a few clothes from the maternity section. has anyone else bought maternity clothes during recovery before the recovery belly went down? also this question is for anyone: what are your thoughts on buying clothes from the maternity section? even though maternity clothes, especially pants, may be the clothes in the women s clothing market that currently would fit me best, there is still a part of me that is very resistant because i am not pregnant. i guess one vanity based upside is i wouldn t have to buy oversized clothes, one of the reasons i ve avoided clothes shopping this long is to avoid seeing my increased sizes. i just thought i would ask you guys about maternity clothes since you would understand this situation better than the average person. thank you ",

"i just did a body check and feel disgusted with myself please help. i've been weight restored since november and idk what just happened. idk if i'm experiencing body dysmorphic thoughts right now or what, but i just did a body check and realized my arms are fucking huge now. literally, they do not even look proportionate to my weight . they look so broad and chubby and i feel so disgusting and ugly right now. 1 years of starving myself just to eat better and still hate myself ? is this just how it's going to be for the rest of my life ? i haven't had an ed thought in months but the sight of my arms was enough to convince me i should lose weight all over again. i am so tired of living with my brain.",
"depression is causing a relapse. i'll start off by saying that yes, i'm aware this is more of something to bring up to my therapist, but i don't see her until mid late april. that being said... my last depression spike hit me hard. like most spikes there's no reason save for not being sad recently enough. no motivation for life has turned into reaching out for easy comfort foods. sadly most of my comfort foods are from when i was much deeper in my ed. didn't really think anything of it, since it ""comes with the territory"". that is until i started getting fuzzy vision and noticed the return of the brain fog. then curiosity got the better of me and i did something stupid, i weighed myself. first time in months. i'm no where near as bad as i was, but i'm back to being closer to underweight than a healthy weight. worse part is my ed voice is ecstatic. i keep hearing things along the lines ""look at what we can do without trying, imagine if a little effort was applied"". now i'm stuck back in the loop of some of my compulsive habits and this is making my depression worse. i... i just want off this ride. or at the very least, a ""normal "" brain... whatever that means. sorry for the rant, but thank you for taking the time to read.",
"how long would i expect to stay at residential care for?. hi everyone. i've been admitted to residential care since tuesday this week. does anyone have an estimated time of how long until i can come home? is it related exclusively to weight, or does it have to do with behaviour attitude as well? i've been responding well had a bit of a cry due to homesickness, but that's about it. thank you ",

"how to learn to trust the body and feel safe? tips?. i ve had emetophobia my whole life and ibs d m since 2 16. i also have visceral hypersensitivity. a lot of my fears around food, food restriction and weight loss stem from my anxiety and panic disorder and phobias around body symptoms like an upset stomach, nausea, vomiting. i also have a lot of ocd tendencies to do with contamination and cleanliness. i also tend to repeat what i ve ate that day to myself over and over several times a day. i m not an unhealthy weight but it s a constant struggle and i feel like i m either constantly frightened or taking meds to suppress the feeling of being constantly frightened. problem is i just don t feel safe in my body. i don t trust body sensations, i don t recognise body sensations sometimes. hunger to the point of shaking and feeling sick sometimes comes out of nowhere as i feel like i ve felt uncomfortably full right up to the point of feeling ravenous. sorry for rambles. any tips on how to feel safe in the body? how to be at ease with sensations? anyone in a similar situation please feel free to reach out, it would be nice to feel less alone ",
"i think i ve developed an eating disorder from being with someone with one, is this possible?. tldr at bottom me and my girlfriend are both 19 f and she has had a really bad eating disorder anorexia nervosa since she was a kid. when we met, she was hardly eating anything at all and all i ve done is try and support her in getting better. the problem is, for the first almost whole year, she refused to get help and would shut down any attempt i gave at helping her doing all the research about every eating disorder including hers obviously, seeking out recovered peoples story s, getting my doctor therapist to help me in better understanding her and looking for more resources, trying to get her to do recovery programs nothing worked for a while and it took a huge toll on me emotionally to see her hurting herself like that. after some time, she agreed to get help but it s been a rollercoaster i know it s to be expected during recovery but it s really a lot to handle . she has started and stopped the treatment a couple times and every time she s getting help and doing better i get so happy and proud and then so crushed when she stops. it s to the point where it s affecting me physically as i m now struggling to eat, not because i m insecure about how i look food used to be my 1 source of comfort , it s because every time i go to eat now i picture her, and i wonder if she s eaten today and then my mind is filled with thoughts about her being so dangerously unhealthy and it makes me sick, anxious, sad and unable to eat. i ve lost so much weight strength and i ve noticed my stomach has been having a lot of problems. i try and eat and can t now and it feels like i have an eating disorder as well now obviously different than hers but it still inhabits me from eating . i want to know if it s possible that i have developed some sort of eating disorder and how to help my girlfriend and i. all i ever wanted was to be supportive but i m slowly becoming less and less because of how much it s affecting me and i need to know how to be more supportive through all of this, any help is appreciated. tldr; i think i ve developed an eating disorder after being with someone who refused to get help for so long, is this possible?",

"disaster first therapy session. i'm not sure if this is a request for advice or more like a vent, but i'm at my wits end here right now. my partner who has anorexia, not me , just got out from their first therapy session at a center specialized for eating disorders. the first thing they told them was to lose weight. i'm not gonna be specific here numeric wise in order to not be triggering. my partner has been in some kind of recovery for a year now on their own , and they have managed to eat much more healthier and gain weight. although, they're still struggling a lot mentally and that's why they decided to go for therapy. they have very bad experiences with previous therapists who should have their licenses revoked and it took a lot of effort and months of working on it mentally to manage to begin therapy now. and the first therapy session was a freaking disaster. who tells an anorexic they need to lose weight? they encouraged them to start going to the gym and gave them more efficient guidelines for some supplements they take so they achieve better weight loss. i tried really hard to convince myself that this was some misguided way to not forbid them to do things and attempt to coax them to a better way of practicing some things, but buddy, i cannot stomach this. why do we have to have such shitty mental health system in this forsaken country? not from usa . this is supposedly one of the 2 main organizations for eating disorders and they botched it so damn hard. and it wasn't even 1 psychologist, it was two of them. they also booked her an appointment for a psychiatrist, which i normally would encourage, but given how all this has already unfolded, i bet they will be one of those old school psychiatrists that prescribe anti depressants for a mere cough this was the norm here till around 1 y ago, now the landscape is slightly changing but at a snail's pace . they threw some psychology jargon in there from the first session , which confused my partner even more,something like masked anorexia, which i'm not even sure it exists as a term, but i didn't even understand the purpose of saying it cause my partner is already diagnosed so... the problem is they now kinda naturally don't want to ever attempt going for therapy again and they are really beaten from all this. i know i can't do much about it, i feel so darn helpless. i can't watch them suffer like this, giving up, being slapped in the face everytime they ask for help metaphorically by all those charlatans of therapists. i've found one therapist they possibly could be good for them, it was suggested by my own therapist which is darn awesome, i was really lucky there but they can't support it financially right now neither can i . the only reason i'm hoping it could be good for them is because my partner has loved my own therapist, hearing from me, and this one works the same way my own does, so i'm hoping it could be a good match. but not right now, and i'm afraid never. this is driving me crazy, i really have no clue how to help my partner. p.s.: sorry for the rant, i hope this isn't triggering for any of you. if it is, i'll gladly adjust it and correct it. edit: corrected pronouns for privacy edit2: added non us clarification",

"denied treatment twice. a few months ago i had an assessment with my local heathcare's outpatient program. they denied me because my weight was too low and told me to put in referrals for a few hospitals in the area. i had an assessment with one of the hospitals today and they also denied me bc of my weight being too low. apparently, their ed unit is residential and off the hospital campus therefore can't take the medical risk. the nurse said if i could gain x amount in 4 weeks, they would let me in. she was very curt with me and said that based on my history, she doesn't think i could do it. she really made me feel like shit because she said that if i didn't succeed in 4 weeks, then it would have been a waste of resources and she'd rather the spot go to someone else. i understand that but it still stings. my next option is an assessment for inpatient at a hospital. they don't have a weight requirement because they're a hospital. my assessment isn't until the very end of march, and after that it'll probably be 2 4 months before i'm admitted. timeline wise that'll put me at the beginning of my next semester, but for financial reasons i can't take a semester off. also, my entire current team is through my school so if i'm out before the next semester starts, i wouldn't have their support when i got out. there's a possibility i can do some courses online while in hospital but i'm not sure. i feel so hopeless. i know that treatment will happen eventually, but i've been on waitlists since december 2 2 . every day it just seems less likely that i'll recover. i've been asking for help for so long, and had i gotten it sooner it never would have gotten this bad. i don't have much confidence that ip will help me that much at this point. i'm going to try but everything seems so hopeless.",

"question about hunger signals amp; bloating 3.5 months into recovery. i ve been in recovery since the end of october last year amp; have been doing my best to honour my mental hunger since then. i usually eat 3 meals amp; 2 snacks every day, sometimes more. i m so bloated all of he time, to the point it s uncomfortable, from the moment i wake up to the moment i fall asleep. i rarely feel hungry amp; if i do i ll get full amp; bloated really quickly after eating anything. i m also still gaining weight near enough at the speed i was when i started eating again . does anyone else feel this? am i legit just eating too much for my body or is this normal? when will the bloating amp; feeling overly full all the time end?",
"questions possible tw for last question, please be careful.. i would like to start this off by apologizing for the length of this post. i started actual recovery four days ago. this time, i'm actually committed. it's not half assed, and i'm trying very hard to break food rules. i am very, very scared though. based on the information i have and have not gathered, there are numerous questions i have. please, if you can, help me with these. just to reinforce the title, the last question can be a little triggering, or maybe not. i'm not sure, but if i were to see that at my lowest point i would be quite triggered myself. ease proceed with caution :. 1 extreme hunger or binge eating? i read online that in the beginning of recovery you experience something known as extreme hunger. it makes sense, but then i heard someone referring to it as recovery binging. i did some more research and i read that i could be developing bed, that's not my end goal and i don't know how to prevent it. i don't know what it is, but when will this period end? how long does it take, generally? i feel as if it won't ever stop, it scares me. i don't want to call this binging but the more i think about it, the worse it gets. 2 how long does weight redistribution take to occur? i love joking about this but right now i look like vector, it's all fun and games until i realize how stupid i probably look to others. i know i should wear baggy clothing but the feeling of uncomfortableness from within does not go away by simply wearing something big. how long did it take for you guys? i know everybody is different but i would like to find an average. 3 when the hell should i eat? i don't know when to eat, i've been following my mental hunger cues even if i ate less than an hour ago and i've been following my rare physical hunger cues, but i don't know when to eat. how distanced should my meals be, and should i wait until i feel physically hungry before i eat? 4 how much should i eat? i don't want to eat beyond satisfaction and i don't want to eat below satisfaction either but there is no set point to satisfaction and it's making me extremely anxious. i don't like eating so frequently but i don't know why i keep thinking about food, even if i'm full as hell. tw inpatient treatment 5 i have not been sent to inpatient treatment but i feel like i need it, should i ask for it or is it too late? as i mentioned earlier, i started recovery four days ago but i have not been sent to inpatient treatment. for the past four days i have been eating like shit, and each passing day becomes more and more mentally draining. after doing some research, i learned that the refeeding system is what is generally implemented with beginning stages of recovery. as of late, i have been feeling increasingly irritable due to the amount of food i have been consuming and i am scared of developing binge eating disorder. i understand that this is just extreme hunger but i don't know what to do i'm so sorry for the length of this post. thank you to anyone who replies. i wish you all the best of luck ",
"smallest victories . so i've really hit restriction bad lately and i have gotten so used to the pain of hunger that i just ignore it most days because i don't even realize i'm in it. however, i had a wake up call a while back and decided to start small by drinking nutrient shakes drinking something feels way easier than eating anything . i'm a voice actor, and i drank a shake about 3 minutes before i went in the booth. i have not heard such strong acting come from me in a while and i realized after some mindfulness that wait... my entire body doesn't hurt? i don't have brain fog? i am in a good mood and having a great time? even just the smallest amount of intake changed the way i felt like night and day and it helped me realize that providing myself with the things i need to survive doesn't have to hurt and now i have solid proof that yes, i will feel better whenever i treat my body kindly. it felt like such an ""aha"" moment and i'm so thankful for it. i just had another shake this morning and am already feeling my body pains go away. any step toward progress is progress, period, and i'm really proud of myself for this. i am always inspired by the posts and support i see here and i'm thankful for this subreddit because it has helped me feel so much less alone. thank you all for reading and thank you for allowing me to be here lt;3 i wish you all many victories of your own, also.",

"finding self worth without an...is it even possible?. to start, i do not miss anorexia at all i do not miss feeling like a feeble animal because it s a torment to eat around people; i do not miss the mood swings and psychotic thoughts; i do not miss hiding in a bathroom to eat a cliff bar; i do not miss getting cold when it s 75 degrees out; i do not miss passing out after a jog; i do not miss buying children s clothes at 25 nor do i miss the confused faces people would give me when i d tell them i m an adult when my body looked like a sick child . i don t miss any of it. and i still hate what it did to my social life and how it made me lose 6 of my hair. but why is it, i m weight restored now, i m free and yet i still hate myself. i find no issue with my new body because i recognize it was inevitable and a matter of life early death but when 1 of all your thoughts,goals, and aspirations revolves around weight loss and calorie restriction, and your ed mind has finally silenced while you lost every speck of who you are in the process who the fuck am i now ? idk. i really don t know and though i hate my ed so much, why is it that i can t find anything interesting or enjoyable about myself anymore? ironically i cared way less about myself with my ed but felt so much more alive, real, and not as plain and depersonalized as i do now. i feel like anorexia erased me and i ll never come back . i want to feel renewed but i don t know how and fuck anyone who reads this and says you wont find yourself by posting on reddit; do something with your life . i m not looking for a self help. i m not looking for mantras . i want to know who has experienced this emptiness and sense of feeling lost and if it ever goes away or it s just the remnants of the disorder .",
"my anorexia recovery journey so far. hey guys i'm a 17 year old teenager with an ed that started may 2 21 that result me losing my period and went from me being slightly overweight for my bmi due to lack of mobility during covid to being almost to underweight for my bmi i am an athlete so i probably lost muscle and have a larger body structure which is probably why even at my lowest weight i never dipped into an ""underweight"" bmi anyways i ""came out"" to my parents one day about my eating disorder last december as i realize it was ruining my life. i had went from a slightly insecure happy teenage girl to a girl who would only think about food and be angry all the time. i was also cold all the time and when i went on a trip to las vegas where it was literally 11 degrees, i was cold. it sucked. my hair started falling out and i didn't feel like myself. in the end, i started scaring myself with the pictures i took off myself. i went to the doctor and she said i had lost a lot of weight and said thats why i had lost my period and she put me on hormones, which didn't even work. at this point i knew i destroyed my body and wanted to recover for myself. it was hard but i started to raise my calories slowly each week by 1 . i didn't notice a significant increase in weight and was just happy that i wasn't under a certain number. to put it in perspective, my lowest weight was the same when i was 12 years old. i have since then started recovery with equip health and it hasn't been easy. i be honest, i still count calories in secret , but have increased it to 2,35 . they have restricted my movement significantly which suxked because i weight lifted, walked around 1 to 2 miles daily and rollerskated every other day for maybe 2 to 3 hours making me moderately active. i've only been skating recently under supervision if i eat before and after which has been hard. the first days were especially hard, as they had me eat breakfast. i hadn't eaten breakfast for basically my entire life but taking it to the extreme during the height of ed doing intermittent fasting and not eating till sometimes 5pm. after the initials tantrums about not being in control of what i'm eating and when to eat, its been going great this is my second week and i already am feeling so much better i now have had breakfast everyday, poop everyday which is crazy because i've had constipation problems my entire life and just feel more energized and happy sometimes its hard to eat things that i don't feel are ""worth it"" or have enough protien, but i feel a lot freerer in general. i haven't been able to see my weight which doesn't bother me too much, it's just kinda of triggering when my parents hug me after weighing me because obviously i've gained weight lol, but the i dont really care and my body looks the same, if anything just a little more filled out but i have so much more energy i also have gotten over my fear of oil and its really weird because it only took about a week please keep in mind that this is my recovery journey and that everyone's is different and the quickness of my journey has been not only a shock to me, but my therapists. i've had some great motivators, like as soon as i get my period back, i can exercise more moderately lol and i'm very all or nothing so i put all the energy i focused on my ed into my recovery. i also feel that as i feel better about myself and in general l, its more of a motivator for me to get better. i'm just pretty proud of myself and i want to let everyone here know who is struggling that recovery is worth it and starting sooner is way better than never trying. another reason i think my review has been faster is because i was anorexic for less than a year. i know some people don't have that luxury, but just know that no matter where you are with your ed, its never to late to start recovery even if it is gradual. i hope this is motivating to you all out there and just know that weight shifts everyday and throughout life we are meant to grow and change. getting rid of weighing yourself and setting a calorie goal helped me get better but it might differ for you i just hope you all help yourself by treating yourself and making yourself a priority in recovery lt;3",

"a question for anyone else who didn t reach an extremely low weight. when you hear that you have to be severely underweight to qualify as anorexic, does it trigger you too? every time i hear this it makes me feel extremely invalid and want to start restricting again to do it right this time. i don t want to relapse, and i can t like i did before because i need to be able to function at work, but i hate essentially being told that i wasn t anorexic. the textbook that triggered me this time is basically saying my experience was only displaying symptoms of anorexia, this reminds me too much of how i justified it in the past by saying i had anorexic tendencies instead of admitting that i was anorexic. with my symptoms, the physical effects, and how little i was eating, how can it not be anorexia? i started at overweight and i started recovering before i was underweight because losing my period and my hair for as long as i was scared me, i had no energy to feel emotions anymore, and i was struggling to form sentences. it was affecting my personal relationships and i couldn t lose my support system because of something i was self inflicting. why does recovering when i did make me invalid in the eyes of other people? why do so many people reinforce the idea that i wasn t sick enough?",
"extreme hunger is ruling my life tw . genuinely listen to the tw if you're vulnerable firstly i want to apologise that all my posts are in a similar playing field but i still need to get this off of my chest i've had extreme hunger for a few weeks now and it's gotten way out of proportion. today its holidays where i live the largest break i've had was around an hour or two to go food shopping, otherwise i have spent all day either cooking, washing my dishes so i could use them for food again or eating. i feel intense shame. i go into the kitchen as litte as possible because i dont want anyone to see and judge me. honestly if i felt capable of stopping myself i'd go right back to restriction out of pure panic, which is also so so dumb because i have goals which i can't reach by depriving myself, even now i'm consistently falling back to safe foods and eating lower calorie options even though i know it could sabotage the process. yesterday i didn't eat for too long and i got so hungry that i detached from reality and the people around me. i cannot feel physically or mentally satisfied no matter how much i consume. i cannot concentrate on school anymore because all i think about is food and i don't want to meet any of the people i love because then i won't be able to eat if i'm away from home. i'm considering asking my doctor to do a leptin resistance test but i also think im just hoping i have it so i don't feel as guilty. the guilt is mind numbing i swear. by this point i think this can't be classified as extreme hunger anymore. what are your thoughts? and do you have any tips on dealing with this? have a lovely day ",

tangible goals. basically last summmer when i like went through my first round attempt of anorexia recovery and was able to get my weight up not restored but enough to allow me to play soccer a big reason was because i had a tangible goal that i needed to hit a set weight to play soccer. this time i don t have that goal because i m done with college soccer so i didn t know if anyone has any ideas or anything to kind of mimic that? p.s i know i wasn t truly recovered this summer as i was never weight restored and was not mentally recovered.,
"health problems that persisted after weight restoration?. i m curious to know if anyone on here faced long term complications even after they were weight restored ? i ve been weight restored for about 2 months now and my doctor confirmed it just this tuesday and i was ecstatic however, something i ve been realizing so far is a lot of stuff isn t what all the ed recovery blogs made it out to be. after 9 months of recovery, my hair continues to have the slowest growth imaginable and is still dealing with crazy breakage. i thought my bald spots would heal up and though there s new growth there now, it s terribly slow. my skin is a hell of a lot less dull and pale and i don t have dark circles under my eyes anymore, but my skin is now more prone to rosacea and acne . my lanugo went away but there s still hair on my nipples. i don t have mood swings anymore nor deal with psychotic and or ed thoughts but i still have no libido. i don t get joint pain anymore, but also think my bones are still pretty weak. surely there are far more severe heath complications post ed than this and i still haven t went to an endocrinologist or rheumatologist to check on my thyroid and joints but sometimes i get scared thinking what the future will hold with 1 years of anorexia. i m hoping for body resilience but i don t fully see it yet . though all my labs are coming out within normal range now, still somehow i wish i could see more progress especially with my hair . ultimate poor body image trigger rn.",

"i was underweight for 1 years and i really wonder what damage i did.. most of this time i d say i was mildly underweight bmi around 17 17.5 . other times i was at bmi 15. i grew up in a house with no food. mom was chronically ill and dad didn t give half a shit. that led to me scavenging and begging for food from an early age. by 7 i was always packing my own lunch, which was a scant mix of foods that weren t real foods, like a granola bar. i went to a tiny school and i think the teachers knew my parents were nowhere near poor, but they saw me constantly beg. i believe they said nothing because, how could i not have food? we weren t poor. my brother and i thought a delicacy was microwaving cheese in a bowl. my mom has had anorexia since age 17. she is now 55. she s damaged her metabolism to the point where she s at a normal weight and probably eats under 8 cal a day. i went through childhood seeing my very thin mother bawling her eyes out because she gained five pounds, and just not eating. i m pretty sure her diet these days consists of small mugs of ice cream and a few almonds. meals were not cooked. food was not available. the pantries and fridge had maybe milk and pretzels. i was responsible for 95 of my meals. i remember being 14 and in health class. my friends mom cooked us a pot of corned beef with veggies with a pressure cooker. i stuffed myself and was utterly shocked that other people got that. i told my mom not at all meaning to be spiteful that i had a good home cooked meal for the first time in months and was so excited. she cried. nothing changed. from about age 12 well, probably before to 22 23, i was at most bmi 17.5 and at least, 15. i got my period at age 12, at 4 9 and no more than 8 lbs, more like 75. i was bmi 15 for maybe two and a half years. i have been in recovery for another 2.5 years. i m a normal weight for the first time since practically toddlerhood. and i have chronic health issues. i wonder constantly how much was malnutrition and anorexia. i know some issues run in the family, but i feel like i got a shit start and i may be damaged for it. thanks for letting me rant.",

"i recognised a pattern. hi, i'm really sorry for posting so much lately but this community makes me feel so valid and understood recently i recognised a pattern. tomorrow is day 15 of recovery and so far i'm challenging myself by introducing ""new old food"" i liked but didn't eat in the past two years. last week for example i bought butter and milk because i loved bread with butter and salt with a glas of milk as a child, the other day it was cheese, today hummus. so whenever i buy something like this i go crazy. like i eat so so much of it. and then the next day i have some more but not too much, instead a normal amount. not because of restriction though, but because that's all i crave. i feel like my body's first instinct is to eat a lot of this new food because it is scared that that will be the last time it can have it, but then it realises that that's not true and i can enjoy it whenever. the first day of recovery i literally ate 4 pieces of cake or something obviously way more, i'm looking at you chocolate and i wanted more all the time, but now i'm satisfied with one piece of cake every couple of days. also, the first couple times i ate until i was stuffed. that doesn't happen anymore either. however this satisfaction only works with foods i reintroduced. new foods are still devoured as if i'm a wild animal lol. did anyone else experience this?",

"i m too broken over what anorexia did to my hair. am i always going to look this ugly?. when i was at my lowest weight, something crazy happened while i was in remission from alopecia. my hair was growing the fastest it ever grew before. i had a literal lion s mane of hair and unfortunately, my sick self was convinced my ed was healthy as my hair continuously bursted in every strand from a previous patch. now what i didn t know at this time was how short lived that growth spurt would be. hormonal imbalances in androgen levels contributed to the fast growth but then within 5 months, it contributed to the fastest loss ever. about 8 inches of my hair fell off ; i developed 2 new bald patches at my crown and guess when all this happened? 2 17. 5 years and you d think my hair would ve grown tremendously by now right? no. my patches are still visible and the extent to which all my hairs uneven in length makes me hate myself for what i did even more. thyroid damage stunted any possible growth. and i ve been in recovery 9 months and i m finally at a healthy fucking weight and im seeing breakage even now the new hairs are even growing in matted and just so fucked to where i think i might ve permanently damaged follicles? i m getting treatment from my dermatologist; i apply rogaine everyday plus topical ointments but my god, how much fucking longer do i have to hate myself like this? i can t even get hair extensions because my dermatologist said the extra weight and pressure to the scalp will lead to even more fall out. if i can go back in time and never have become anorexic, i d give the fucking world for it. why is it once i m healthy , i have to suffer from what anorexia s done? why is it when i ve overcame 1 years of starving myself, i have to still see the effects of anorexia on my head every day. fuck my life.",

"some days hungrier than others?. so i have a really stupid question. this is week two of recovery and i decided to do it by sticking to a meal plan after some initial binges which i believe were a direct reaction to the recent restriction before committing to recovery . so i eat three meals and three snacks, also hitting the recommended calories. some days i'm not hungry at all but still make myself eat all my meals and snacks, other days i get hungry just in time for every meal and snack and other days i'm hungry more often. that happened like twice a couple of days back. i don't think that it's extreme hunger since i can feel full after having a couple more snacks or going back for seconds or something. but i'm wondering, is that normal? like is it normal to be more hungry on some days and less hungry on other days even though i'm not ""moving"" more or doing more intense things than on the days i'm less hungry? i'm honestly confused because i ignored my hunger cues for like two years and i don't really remember what it was like before. thanks ",

"anorexia into binge eating story . guys... i don't feel like this is right. i have anorexia for quite some time now and complaced into the disease without trying to change anything. when my period would be missing for months and people started noticing i'm on the verge of trading an organ for one more day of living on body fat, they started telling me that if i don't change and fix it, they will take me to a psychiatrist at the end of the respective month. scared of consequences and knowing that an actual psychiatrist would possibly bring me a lot of good against any psychosomatic disease i would encounter, i tried fixing myself. so the binges started. my boyfriend would tell me how i desperately need the calories, the carbs, we spoke about ""cheats"" being what i afford to eat right now because i need to gain weight. i am terrified ,i spent my entire week every 2 3 days binging to the point where i am physically hurt. i can barely breathe and cannot move and i feel like what i'm doing to myself is absolutely disgusting. the next days looking in the mirror feels like gaining a ton and i'm very unhappy and crying about how i currently look while gaining weight.. i know i have to fight through but is this really worth the pain im taking my body to? i'm really scared and suffering and if i open up to my boyfriend again he would be saying the same comforting me through ""you need to eat you need it"" ... the binge episodes i never asked for this and i don't know how to stop myself without falling into episodes of not eating ,anorexia again. i have learned so much about nutrition these months and been healthy gymming for a while but i feel like this is all useless. the eating disorders are still there and won't give me any breaks or my brain for a fact to the point where i don't understand what's healthy and what's not.",

"the same morning i agreed to go home and work on recovery is the same morning i hit a new lw and now i dont want to. last night after having a very intense breakdown, i phoned my nan. she told me my options were either go inpatient again or go home to her and follow a similiar inpatient program except i get to prepare and choose my own food. i was excited. i was going to get better. until i weighed myself this morning and woke up the smallest ive ever been. now i want to keep it, i dont want her to help me get better. im so triggered i just want to be small but i dont want to live like this either. maybe i could maintain? but its too late. shes coming today and theres no way she'll let me back out without taking me to hospital and fuck i messed up.",
"it feels like my family s trying to prevent me from recovering. i have a crap relationship w food and i have to mentally prepare myself for every meal. ive actually planned it out so for this full week i could eat dinner. and a few of them including tonights meant i could eat before my family did so i wouldn t have to eat in front of them but i went downstairs to start cooking and then found out that my mum changed the dinner for tonight meaninh id have to eat something im not prepared for with my family. i had literally the safest foods together cause im sick to death of being scared and ashamed to do something that literally every person has todo. ik its not on purpose but ive got a body food shaming brother, and a mum who refuses to acknowledge how much things like this hurt me. everytime we talk about food i end up crying, and as much as i wanna get better i cant with my family",
"debilitating hunger. so i thought i was done with recovery because i had gained all the weight back and was feeling fine for a while. but i've been having stomach issues constantly ranging from food sitting in my stomach and not moving to now it feels like it's not staying in there long enough. i've started gaining weight again and literally cannot get full. my stomach feels irritated and even painful at times and the hunger is constant. i was thinking that maybe it could be gastritis and took antacids yesterday which helped. but today they aren't helping and i feel even worse. i am literally so done with recovery, i just want it to be over. i feel like i can't take it anymore, it feels like absolute hell. i'm starting to think that maybe my body is never going to work normally again. i'm supposed to go on a trip in a few weeks with family members and if this keeps going i'm propably gonna end up spending the entire time in a hotel room binging. i feel like i just want to go to sleep and not wake up anymore.",
"chewing and spitting ""binges"". i've struggled with chewing and spitting food every day for the last 3 or so years. i do it religiously at 5pm and at 9pm. it's like a binge except i don't swallow the food. i know i'm still absorbing calories, so to make up for this i don't eat outside these chew and spit times. i haven't actively swallowed food in a really long time. there is nothing i want more than to stop this, but it's such a ritual at this point that i spiral if i can't do it. even when i was inpatient i found food to hoard and use for c s when i was really desperate. i couldn't tell nurses doctors because it's just to gross and embarrassing. it keeps my head quiet for a couple of hours a day and it's the only thing that's comforting. it's disgusting, embarrassing, expensive, bad for my teeth and it causes me to gain weight anyway. i've tried gradually cutting down the amount of food i go through in c s; i've tried replacing it with other coping mechanisms healthy and unhealthy ones ; and i've tried distracting myself. nothing has worked. i do it even if i don't want to and i continue even when i'm not enjoying it. it's so hard to find info about this online, or to find other people who have experienced it. i'm sure there's someone out there who can relate? i would appreciate any contribution to this advice, personal experience with recovering, a comment saying that you struggle with the same literally anything",
"i feel like the only way to get rid of my anorexia is to let it kill me. i've been inpatient twice and both times i came out, i instantly invested all my energy into getting rid of the weight gain. ive been forced to recover, ive tried to recover on my own, ive tried it all. but it just doesnt work. the compulsions wont go away. the obsession wont go away. im trying again. have been for a couple weeks but my calorie intake is less than half of what my doctors reccomended when i was last discharged. i just cant increase it. i cant see my future anymore. i cant see anything i once planned. there is no way out of this.",
"support needed recovery day 1. i have suffered from disordered eating pretty much my whole life including some intense daily bulimia in my early 2 s and now very restricted eating for a long time. i m 35 the past few months things really went downhill and resulted in me being very severely underweight for my height and the lowest i ve ever been by far. i was an avid runner definitely over exercising but then got injured so my activity level is currently zero. i barely have the energy to go up the stairs. today i read tabitha farrar s book and watched a couple videos. i decided enough was enough and this afternoon i got the courage to just let myself eat. cereal, granola, granola bars, protein shake, popcorn, 1 2 jar peanut butter, etc. etc . of course, i m freaking out about it now. but i truly do want to recover and enjoy my life. i am terrified about binging and becoming bulimic again. and yes, i am 1 scared of gaining weight. i am so scared of all of it but i know i have to face these fears. i even had my husband take the scale away. how do i look at this as not a massive binge and as just letting my body heal. is it okay that i still want to eat more today even though my stomach is stuffed. i don t want to make myself sick. i don t know how i m going to function if i m eating like this i m also a teacher . can anyone who has made it past this point share how they kept recovery going? is it possible to recover after nearly a lifetime of disordered eating? thank you so much.

"tips from a recovered person.. hey all. i'm an ednos survivor and currently weight restored and mostly recovered. i still have my bad body image days, but i'd like to share how i made it this far and hopefully help someone. 1: stop weighing yourself. this seems obvious, but i mean never. not even at the doctor's office. i recently achieved my new years resolution of not weighing myself for the entire year of 2 21. if you are at the doctor, stand with your back to the scale and tell them you don't want to know your weight. tell them you don't want your paperwork when you leave. they will print your weight on it. or decline the scale altogether and give them the most recent weight you know. no nurse has ever questioned me and they've all been more than accommodating. 2: set functional goals. think of the things you never get to do because of your eating disorder. do them. mine was weight training. i always wanted to be strong, but i was constantly tired and malnourished. if i was tempted to get on the scale or restrict my intake, i reminded myself that i would never get muscles if i starved. your goal might be something different, like being able to hike without getting winded, or going out to eat more often. 3: donate your clothes. this one also seems obvious. but it's really easy to slip back into your old jeans and lament about what you used to look like. get rid of your clothes when they don't fit anymore, and you don't have to worry about the temptation to self destruct. 4: imagine the person you love most in this world. mom, wife, husband, sister, best friend. now think of all the things you love about them. not one thing on that list is their weight. 5: now imagine that someone calls your loved one an ugly, worthless burden on society. you'd punch them in the face do that to the voice in your head that's low key a huge bitch. punch it in the face. shut that shit down. 6: think of what your eating disorder has taken from you. precious headspace for hobbies. time with loved ones. freedom. sanity. take it back. 7: choose life. you have to want to get better. you have to choose to get better. every. single. day. even when it's hard. if i can do it, anyone can. i almost died. i have a permanent heart condition as a result of my last relapse. i literally had to fight for my life to get here. you, the person reading this. you can do it too. i hope this helped you.",

"to those in recovery: how much will getting help really change my life?. hi, everyone. i ve been struggling with i believe to be undiagnosed anorexia for about 6 years. i m ready to get help because i think it s impacting every part of my life. i dropped out of college this semester, partially because of the stress of attempting to manage whatever disordered eating habits i have. since the new year, i ve been trying to eat normally and improve my relationship with food, but i fear it s sunk so far into my life i won t be able to escape it. my depression and anxiety have been getting worse and i want help, i really do. i am just terrified of talking to my parents who both have disordered eating habits and are currently dealing with my brother s binging. i think i feel resentful. that he, at 13, is getting the help i feel i ve needed for a long time. and part of me is so pissed at my parents for never believing me when i mentioned my issues to them numerous times. but what i really wanted to ask is how much did recovery impact every part of your life, not just food? i think it s time, i m just so scared.",
"long time lurker first time poster. random thought, but does anyone else experience this?. i would say i m partially recovered, i still struggle heavily daily and still relapse for a few days but it s been about a year and a half since i ve been completely problematic. when i get hungry it s extremely violent. the problem is that when i do get hungry it s about a 2 minute time span that i have to eat.. in those 2 mins food is an obsession i can smell it, my mouth is watering and all i can think about is food. doesn t even have to be a specific food but i m craving it so badly and if i can get my hands on it i ll eat it. i get a pain before i eat of emptiness and it is physical but more empty feeling than pain but usually stops right after i finish eating. but, if i miss that 2 minutes though, i completely and usually honestly forget about eating, like don t even acknowledge it exists and i couldn t fathom even being hungry. the weirdest part though is how much excruciating pain physical pain i get when i do force myself to eat after those 2 mins. i m not sure why my body is so extreme with this maybe because my past of not eating but is this something that i feel is so out of my control so i don t know how to combat it but it s extremely debilitating because i m either happy and thankful i m eating or i m in so much pain i feel like i m gonna vomit so it s hard in the first place to even eat at that point. also does food better when you accept it because i also seem to convince myself that after those 2 mins pass and i m in pain that everything is suddenly going to make me sick or that it s gross? sorry for so much text. i never posted before because i never have a straight line of thought lol.",
