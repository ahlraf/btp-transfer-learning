"going through recovery, recently found out i'm gluten free. worried i will relapse. tw talk of binging restricting. hey, all. i started my recovery journey at the beginning of this year and it has been going rlly well for the most part . however, i've found out i have a gluten sensitivity and now all i want to do is eat gluten and i just binged for the first time this evening in a while. and i keep eating it though it makes me feel like shit. oh, and i get super bloated so my body image also sucks rn. i'm worried that i'm restricting by way of cutting it out of my diet and i'm binging bc of that. i'm still eating carbs, just not ones with gluten. i worry this is going to set me back. any thoughts? thanks. : ",
tw talk about weight . i m losing weight while in recovery and i m not sure if i count as recovering because i m being told that i don t even though i m eating like 5x as much as i used to be. im feeling really confused and upset because i don t know myself if i m recovering or not i m about to hit a new lowest weight even though i m eating 3 meals and 3 snacks ,
"started recovery, am i eating too much now?. long story short, i somehow spiralled into anorexia nervosa formally diagnosed last week about six months ago, from which i lost almost 2 kilos. i progressively felt more shitty both physically and mentally, and five days ago i convinced myself to recover. on the first and second days, i experienced what i think was extreme hunger because i just couldn t feel full and ended up eating about 23 24 calories. the following two days i didn t feel as hungry and ate 14 and 16 calories. today, again, i felt super hungry and only felt satisfied after 23 cals. i m worried that i m going to gain weight if i keep eating this much. i realise that to be in recovery i need to practice not caring so much about the number on the scale, but i just want to maintain my current weight unless it s from muscle gain. for context, i m a 17 year old girl, 5 6 5 7 and i weight 114lbs. for these six months i ve averaged most days at 6 7 calories a day and always clean unprocessed foods. i ve been too weak to exercise during these months of restriction but with proper fuel in my body i want to become more active. will i gain weight if i start consuming an average of 2 calories a day given the information above? also, i read about hyper metabolism after periods of restriction? i am seeing a specialised dietitian on monday but the doubts will haunt me until then, so here i am on reddit asking for your opinions experiences. much appreciated : ",
generally averse. anybody else struggle with picky eating strong food aversions before the onset of your ed?,
i m invested in my recovery but my doctor thinks i have irritable bowel syndrome. i m just so frustrated. i m 24f and have been on some type of diet binge restrict cycle for ten years. i ve really committed to letting that go this year and have been following the eat what you want so you don t binge mindset. i m not on a diet i m just eating foods that make me feel good and havent really been weighing myself. my doctor thinks i have some form of ibs and we re running a bunch of tests but i m just frustrated because i don t want the mental stress of being on a diet after i ve been working so hard to just live and eat and not be on one. i know it ll be good to alleviate the pain i sometimes feel but i m nervous i m going to binge foods that are going to trigger attacks simply because i m going to see them as cheat foods. i feel like i m never going to escape this cycle : ,
"just a nice message: . hey i just wanted to hop on and say that to everyone in recovery i am so proud of you. even if you relapse or go back to old habits, self awareness is great too if you're realizing that your habits are bad, that's already a start. as a person recovering, no matter how many times you feel frustrated with yourself, you're still doing great. i feel like people only view themselves by their flaws but look at the good things feel free to vent love you all ",
"i'm looking better and it's triggering me.. i know the title sounds dumb and it doesn't make sense but recently i came back from some holidays with my parents where i was forced to eat a lot everyone has been telling me i'm looking healthier, better or prettier and telling me i'm glowing. even though i know it's something positive i also know it's because i have gained weight during the holidays. i didn't care about recovery or gaining that much when i was the only one noticing the extra weight but now it's making me want to restrict again. any tips to accept this compliments or make people stop commenting?",
"help: exercise in recovery.. im currently trying to recover from a terrible relapse in my ed. this is probably the worst relapse i ve had, so bad that i almost feel as though i don t even want to recover. but im trying. before my ed, during my ed, and in recovery, i ve always been a very active person. i was mvp on my cross country and track team. i love going on hikes, walks, i ve been into lifting weights, i love physical activity. this genuinely isn t because of my ed, i love the endorphins i get from exercise and it makes me feel amazing. during this relapse, i gave up the exercise that i actually liked doing. i stopped running and lifting and my days turned into very long, boring, slow walks. i feel like i can t give up exercise since it s always been something that made me happy. but the problem is that i don t know if it would harm me to run, lift, or do any higher intensity exercises that i actually enjoy right now. but my mind has associated these slow and boring walks with my ed, and the more i do it the more triggered i get. my ed might have temporarily made me too weak for my preferred exercise so i feel like these walks are all i have. and if i don t walk, i get extremely depressed. i need the endorphins. but if i do walk i get triggered. i want to do what i love again. i need help",
"i m going on vacation soon and i am sick. i m frustrated that i m happy that i don t have an appetite.. i 28f have struggled with disordered eating my whole life. growing up in the 9 s and early 2 s made being skinny mandatory. i ve done a lot of work since then to dismantle my ed and build healthy habits. i have vacation coming up and that s a big trigger for me. i used to restrict heavily before vacations. this time around i ve been doing well viewing food and fuel and energy. then i hit a weird wall. i m sick with a cold, and i genuinely don t have an appetite beyond hot soup. eating more makes me feel sick. but the part that makes me sad is that part of me is happy about it. that old restricting brain is happy that i m basically on soup and crackers for a few days. but i don t want to be happy about it. i have to unpack that. it s just weird. and i wanted to get it off my chest somewhere.",
"it s just not about looks for me, anyone else?. so i think i look pretty good, even after gaining weight, better than before. basically i don t like the starved look, i just want to be. often times i feel like i m too fat, but rarely ever ugly. losing weight was never about getting a certain body or meeting beauty standards, it was a coping mechanism turned obsessive compulsive. i find that the most triggering comments i ve received are from being misunderstood by people who understand eating disorder as what we typically hear about the insecure, teenage girl who just wants to be beautiful . ofc i want to be beautiful, in my rational mind. ofc i m insecure, about my actions, not my looks.",
"can i 14f grow after struggling from an ed from 4 14?. i ve been struggling with my disorder for a while and still actively do, but as an athlete, i want to restore my health. it was at it s peak when i was around 12 13. i m a little under 5 , i think and my parents are 5 5 and 5 6. i am also lactose intolerant. i don t have much to go off of with genetics, but i d like to be at least 5 4. is it possible? for a little more background for those interested, i m a competitive swimmer of 9 years. most elite swimmers are 5 8 , which is something that makes me, as someone in love with the sport, very insecure as i m typically racing people a head or so taller than me. i have always been iffy with weight, probably from the exposure to movies at a young age. 4 year old me was messy with food and never had much of an appetite, and over time, i developed an actual disorder. i was exposed to social media through my mother s iphone at around 7.",
"looking for advice. i'm trying to understand my sister behaviour, she is bulimic and anorexic trying to recover even thought it's hard. i just found buckets of food not just food for her but also bunch of ham and meat. she is long time vegetarian and would never eat it. it's just for rest of my family. i know why she is hiding food but why is he hiding food from other people? thanks a lot for advice, it's the first time i just don't understand her at all",
"non linear recovery help exercising. hi so i'm 21 and have been struggling with my ed since about 16 17, i was at my lowest weight around then and am now at my highest weight ever. i started actually gaining weight around a year ago when i met my current partner and i think being with them has really helped me feel better about myself and weight gain but also we literally do nothing like exercise wise so i think that's also contributing to my weight gain. with summer coming up i've been trying to get new clothes because i went up a size from last summer and it's been so triggering for me and im really struggling. i want to start working out because i need to be more active and want to get into shape, but i'm scared if i start i will relapse. i also have multiple chronic health issues that i'm sure will take a toll on me if i relapse so i'm just struggling. does anyone have any tips on how to start working out eating healthier in recovery? thanks ",
"i need to vent kinda triggering maybe if u don t wanna read u don t have to. this is going to be a long story but i just need to put everything into words so i can figure out how to help myself. because i m so exhausted. anyways i m a 15 year old girl. i ve always been like chubby or fat just never skinny like my skinny friends or the people i saw around me, up until quarantine i was whatever about my weight idk i never liked myself boys were never nice to me but i guess i pushed away all those memories cuz idk. i don t remember much before that anyways i really packed on the pounds in quarantine. definitely was binging and or overeating daily with little to no exercise. considering i wasn t in school i mean i noticed the weight and i wasn t confident but i didn t track calories or worry about what i was eating until in 9th grade near the end we had a science unit on nutrition and began tracking calories as an assignment. i m guessing this is where my problem started but i honestly couldn t tell you when or why i stopped eating as much but i did. at first it wasn t much about calories and more just like idk loss of appetite not sure why, over the summer after 9th i was pretty normal with food id lost like a small bit of weight enough for people to notice but not much at all, yet i had discovered my craving for weight loss and i decided once i was back in school to start up my unhealthy habits again yet this time calories were involved. the months i did this are blurry. i lost enough weight for people to notice, yet i only received congrats instead of concern. my main motivation was that hopefully once i was small enough boys would be nicer to me, give me second looks, treat me like they treated my skinny friends and just overall look at me. but 1 pounds away from my weight goal keep in mind i m not skinny tbh i m smaller but still pretty big i had christmas break then march break then a week of quarantine and i completely veered off track of my restricting and exercise and all of it. the weeks following the disaster that was my binges and breaking every food rule i ever made have been treacherous. i m so exhausted of being obsessed with the number on the scale and the number of calories obsessed with how people look at me or how clothes fit obsessed with how much my weight fluctuates at the end of the day, i m not binging and i m not restricting i m at a horrible in between that makes every day feel dull if i m not getting the thrill of a binge or the thrill of seeing the scale at the lowest it s ever been, then what am i doing? anyways i ve maintained a weight that is 1 pounds away from my goal for the past month and such, never rising or falling and my body image is awful. i hate myself i want so bad to be the person i was before break but i also want a healthy relationship with food and i don t know what to do",
"my family is in town this week, and it a very rare occasion. however, i m scared i didn t lose enough to see my family.. i started seeking medical help, but i m not fully in the recovery mindset. i still need to lose a lot of weight. i m having a hard time losing weight. and my family is one of my trigger, and i m scared that if they think i didn t lose enough, then my diagnosis and mental health, are not to be taken seriously. should i still go ? i miss my sister and i would be so sad to not see her. but the fear and trauma are a lot to handle for me.",
"recovery while in a triggering environment. so i have an undiagnosed ed which is because of my dad who constantly comments on peoples bodies and is just generally obsessed with being healthy and all that crap. im tired of only thinking about weight, what im eating and how im gonna burn the calories ive consumed. how do i recover when im still in an environment that is constantly triggering?",
"4 years old and starting my recovery. i'm new in recovery and have had ed all my life. i'm now 4 and starting a ""real"" recovery for the first time with the help of a nutritionist, doctor and a mentalcoach. for me the only way to break away from my messed up mindset about food was to get a plan, what to eat. i haven't been able to do it on my own, bc i always end up on a different diet like atkins, zone diet, low carbs etc etc. i have tried everything. now my mealplan is made by a doctor. like a recipe to get healthy. i have a high respect for authority and when a doctor tells me to do something, i will do it. it also gives me a permission to eat, bc the doctor and nutritionist told me to do it. i feel that recovery is a real struggle. it feels good to eat normal food and i can feel my body starting to wake up. i still get dizzy, my stomach is like a balloon, i get cold or sweaty and the mental aspect is like hell. i think that recovery for me would be so much easier if my body would not bloat. bloating makes me feel like i have gained a ton of weight and is making my food choices more difficult. i have to eat a dessert every day. i'm finding myself to seek out the lowest calorie deserts like a fruit or the smallest candybar i can find, or skipping the dessert all together.. i feel i am slipping and i should take a grip. but as someone else just said here ""every day is a new day to recover"". i feel that. it's like having an addiction and you need to make the same decision to recover every single day. no one else can understand what we are going through. people with normal attitude about food and eating don't understand the struggle and frustration we have. thank you all for being here and sharing your feelings.",
"indigestion. hi there i m new here and am about 6 months into attempted recovery very slow and inconsistent from restriction, binging and then purging via excessive exercise. i m finding that i am unable to properly digest anything, i get a lump in my throat and regurgitate un digested food bits. also get super bloated and often achy in my forearms and thigh bones. this also happens when i get hungry instead of actually getting the feeling of hunger . i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and has any advice on how to get rid of it it started a little less than a year ago and has not gotten better so far in recovery.",
"recovery is definitely not linear. tw mention of ongoing ed: as of late i ve really been going back to my old ways, i won t name specifics as to not be a trigger for anyone, however i ve found it really hard to feel beautiful without the body i truly desire, every time i see a photo of myself that someone else takes i just see what i tried so hard to rid of i m only 17 which makes it so much harder. i feel that since i m not obviously struggling with an ed no one will take me seriously, i ve never had medical care for it, but i m not sure how to reach out and get help, i want to get better but i really don t know where to start.",
"exercise and nutrition and mfp and her toxic hold on me advice needed. hi pals, been in recovery for two years now and i m doing pretty good at it. one of the ways that i helped myself repair my relationship with food was to go balls to the wall on all my favorite fitness activities climbing, lifting, cycling mostly but now i m concerned that i am not eating enough again. i swore off my scale and calorie counting. i have a general idea of how much i m eating and know exactly how much i m burning. has anyone in the history of ed recovery been able to track calories without a total relapse? how do i make sure i m actually eating enough?",
"still figuring it out. covid has been so hard ya know. precovid i was really in the thick of it and once covid hit, i gained a lot of weight. something i thought i wanted and needed but once i got all the comments about my looks and everything, it really weighed on me. on one hand i was happy to have gained it but in the other i was frustrated that everyone seemed to have an opinion on it. this past year i have been exercising, eating properly, and healthily reducing my weight and finding happiness in it but i m terrified that this is just me masking and justifying poor behaviors. i m so scared that i m reinforcing horrible opinions about myself to my body and scared that i m back sliding. last october it was really bad because i had an event to go to on top of completely spiraling in life and with my college graduation coming up, i don t know if im in control or it is in control. i ve been avoiding big events that make me back slide like i did in october but im still scared. i know i got this and everyone else on here looking for support and help also got it but sometimes it s just hard. thanks for reading i know if you re here you re struggling too but it s one day at a time and now matter how far you fall you will always have it in you to pick yourself back up",
"seeing a different team?. i 15f was put into recovery on wednesday and referred to the hospital by the specialist there. she told me that someone at the office would always be available to call and gave us my family and i her number and said she would always call back. she also told us that she would meet with us at the hospital when she made her rounds on friday at noon. since then she has ignored our calls, never came on friday, and told the nurses that she had talked with us when she hadn t. i know trust is important with your recovery team and i really just don t think i ll be able to trust her. is it worth trying to find someone else?",
"seeking advice on starting recovery. hello everyone, i am a 2 year old agender individual born female, my pronouns are they she and i want to start over with recovery. ever since i was about 14 i would cycle between not eating amp; binging due to intense body dysmorphia and an obsession with junk food. now that my chronic pain that i've also had since 14 is getting worse i've been seeing a doctor to figure out the root cause so i can hopefully manage it better, however, besides the testing i need for any potential diagnoses she told me that i need to lose some weight eat better and start physical therapy. i'm really scared that i'm just going to obsess over it again like i have during past failed attempts to get healthy. to put it into perspective: i can't look at workout videos or straight standard sized models anymore without getting extremely triggered, and i still have the horrible habit of body checking which only makes things even worse. i've always been overweight, and it was something i had just begun to start accepting while working towards body neutrality before my doctor threw a wrench in it. i want to be strong and healthy at least as much my body allows with my other health issues , my focus is no longer as much focused on being skinny, but i'm just so scared of falling down the rabbit hole again. my first physical therapy session is on monday and i'm planning to bring my fiance with me so hopefully if they do take my weight measurements they can tell her instead of me so i can at least avoid that trigger. if anyone has some advice or kind words to give while i restart my recovery process it would be greatly appreciated. also sorry for any formatting issues, i am on mobile amp; i'm sorry if it's a bit rambly my mind is like in a billion places. disclaimer: i don't meet the full requirements for anorexia or bulimia but have a sort mix of the two, so i was diagnosed with general eating disordered behavior by my psychiatrist.",
"anyone else feel like they re faking it?. for more context, whenever i m in recovery i feel like i was faking the entire thing. i feel like if i m eating and gaining weight and not entirely freaking out about it, then maybe i could ve done it the whole time. and that i just wanted to have an ed. i don t know if anyone else relates to this but it would be nice to know other people feel this way",
"how do i explain myself??. throughout my entire battle with my ed, i ve never liked people to see me eat, ask what foods i like, talk about eating with me, none of that. especially if i ve just met the person. it s gotten easier with recovery but i still hate when i m asked on a date and the person suggests we go out to eat. no fault of their own ofc, but idk how to explain why i get uncomfortable even talking about it. i m not at a point yet where i can just suck it up and do it. so, how does one explain themselves to a new romantic interest without scaring them off??? this continues to be one of the biggest issues i have with getting close to people, and i just wish i could help them understand.",
i relapsed 1 week ago with my ed restricting too much and just binged my life away. i need some encouragement or advice to get back in the normal routine and eat intuitively. i was doing so good until i hung out with my friends a week ago who talked about not eating etc and it triggered tf out of me. which cause me to relapse,
"years of recovery down the drain. recently i ve had so much of my life fall apart for years i was doing so good with my recovery from my ed but right now i ve had a bit of a lapse. i ve been restricting for a little over a month. there are a lot of factors and there are points where i want to relapse really badly i haven t had this feeling in years. tonight i binged really hard because of something traumatic that happened yesterday. i almost never ever binge anymore, this is so uncomfortable and now i know why i fought so hard to recover. i m going to sit with this fullness because i desperately do not want to engage in those bad behaviors again. i m sitting here wondering what i need to do to help myself and i know i need a therapist but idk if i m ready to talk about my trauma i m really at war with myself. i m scared.",
"newly recovering. so im pretty new to all of this but i started getting extremely dizzy almost passing out and shaky and it started to scare me because i was finally experiencing physical cons to how little i was eating. i started eating a good lunch and, this is only day 2 of doing so, but each time i get very nauseous and crampy afterwards. is there anything to help this not happen as i get back into eating normal? any advice?",
"one day you will be okay, i promise. hey there to all of you who are struggling with your recovery right now. it has been about five months since i seriously started recovery and i just wanted to let you know that things actually get better. i didn't know what to expect when i started, i was scared and nervous and the first weeks were really difficult. leaving behind the behaviours that i used to cope and to simulate a sense of control over my life felt like leaving a good friend at first. although i knew, that my ed was not my friend and did not help me to live an easier life. but i suppose you get what i mean. the food rules i had made up for myself made me feel like i could get things right, like everything would finally be okay if only i stuck to them and reached a certain weight. but that wasn't the case. and now, that i am starting to leave it all behind, to break those rules and to reach out for help, i am starting to feel alive again. i don't have to torture myself to be pretty. to be enough. to be loved. i deserve happiness, no matter my weight. if you are starting your journey to recovery just now, all of this might sound so unrealistic or far away, but it will come to you as well. maybe it will take a while, but it will get better. you can love your body if you gain weight. you will start to develop a more realistic view on yourself and see, that a few pounds more don't impact your life and happiness. you will feel comfortable in your body. it will all be okay, i promise.",

"started dating a guy that works out 6 times a week and is super fit, and hes triggering me.. he knows i got out of treatment last fall. but what he doesnt know is that i still count everything and restrict myself from going over my tdee today we went out and shared a nutella pizza had to prepare myself and pep talk myself a lot to do this, because it was hard ngl. nutella and pizza is still a fearfood of mine . it felt good since we shared it and he and i seemed to enjoy the pizza at first. but then after a while he commented something really triggering. just imagine how much calories thats in this and then he took a full fork och nutella scraped of from the pizza and said like look . i dont think he has an ed, but he did sound a bit unsure about eating the rest after, which he didn t because he said he was full look, i couldnt finish my last bit because of his comment about the calories and the fact that he didnt eat all of his 1 2 pizza. now a few hours after our date he texted me is it just me or do you also feel a bit weird after that pizza? now im going to be quite honest. there were nothing wrong with the pizza and my stomach feels fine im wondering if he has anxiety over the pizza, bevause he gets a lot of anxiety in generall over a lot of things. how can i make this work? if hes too fixated on food because of his training he will keep being a trigger for me because he reminds me of all the things i used to do. we really connect with eachother overall and he is truly like no other guy ive met, so i reallt want it to work between us. my plan is to tell him about me being triggerd when calories are mentioned. but then thwre is this knowing thought of mine that know that just his lifestyle will keep me thinking about training, body, etc. i even sometimes feel like i need to be as fit as him because thats pherhaps what he likes since he works out so much, or that he should be with someone that also works out as hard as him.",

eating disorder recovery interview. hi i m wondering if anyone who has recovered from an eating disorder be interested in talking to me in an interview? it s for a college module and i m really interested in writing about peoples recoveries but only if they are comfortable and feel safe doing so it would be through zoom but can also be through texts too if you re not comfortable calling of course. it would only be for a few minutes and a handful of questions and of course if this insensitive in any way at all i will happily take down this post ,

"will my hair ever grow back? feeling very discouraged. hi guys i m a 19f who has had anorexia for a year. i have been recovering for the last 3 months. i have restored my weight and eat 2 cals per day. about 6 7 months into anorexia, i started to see clumps of hair come out. large chunks of hair from sections of my scalp would fall out. once i started to enter recovery, the biggest difference i noticed is that less hair falls out. however, my scalp is still bare and naked in places where hair used to be. before my ed, i used to have thick wavy hair and a lot of it too. now, even after being in recovery for 3 months and the shredding stopping, my hair is thin and there is not much of it. i m concerned that the hairs that fell out will not grow back and my hair will remain weak, and thin. for those of you who have recovered or know someone who has recovered: 1. did you grow back your hair to what it looked like before thicker, healthy ? 2. what did you do to support the growth diet, vitamins, oils etc ? 3. will my hair grow back or is this demage permanent? please feel to share your thoughts and any advice. my hair was my favourite feature and i m very anxious about if i will get it back.",

"idk what i m looking for here.... about 5 years ago i started struggling with ed, i was never formally diagnosed as my therapist wasn t very professional and seemed to ignore my symptoms. she was focussed on my anxiety and depression more so, and i think my parents adults around me just wanted me to keep it to myself. i lied my way out of any diagnosis, and just didn t see a doctor or bring it up to anyone, so my issues were greatly ignored. i had intense problems for a year, the typical symptoms we all know about, i won t mention because i don t want to upset or trigger anyone. afterwards, it lessened but i still struggled a lot for a long time. two years ago, 2 2 , it started up pretty rough again, i had moved out on my own and couldn t afford much food so i spiralled and was very sick again. once i got a job and my partner moved in with me, it did get better. now, i m starting to get worried. i weigh the most i ever have, i can see it and i know other people can do. for a while, i ve been happy with it, but it s getting harder. starting to hate how i look, having trouble finding clothes i feel okay in... idk really what to do. i should be honest with my partner, probably, but i m not sure if they d take it seriously. i have too much anxiety to see a professional, i ve never really seen a doctor on my own before. last time i recovered is because i was too anxious that i d need to go to a hospital, i don t want to waste anyone s time. i think this was just a vent, i m sorry.",

"is this normal?. okay so i am basically recovering from the cycle of binge eating junk fast food then restricting on things that are good for me. it really backfired on me in august 2 21 where it was complicated to eat much of anything which induced my restricting side a whole lot more. i fell underweight. drs noticed it. been forced onto recovery ever since. the first month was okay, definitely hard mentally. second month, started to have weird issues. in october, i ended up having a cyst in my left breast. thankfully benign and possibly came from hormonal imbalance. third month came, november wasn t any nicer. i had symptoms of a uti, got tested for that and it was unclear if i had one but they still put me on the antibiotics. two days later on thanksgiving day i was pretty much balling my eyes out in pain from my lower right side of my abdomen. my fianc getting stressed and it also being a holiday, she took me to the er. what i appeared to explain sounded a lot like appendicitis or even gallbladder issues. so they did bloodwork, urine test and ct scan. the ct scan was all clear, except an ovarian cyst on my left ovary. then i definitely had a uti. the uti went away, cyst was still there. my fianc took me to an ob about that, got put on birth control in december. got taken off of it 2 weeks later due to psychological effects my psychiatrist got concerned about. so basically had to just push through with pain killers. today i got to see my ob, good news the cyst is pretty much gone. bad news, symptoms didn t go away with it. i basically have pain all in my lower abdomen, still stronger on the right side. along with nausea, semi bloating and fullness. my ob was leaning towards possibly ibs? it s not really clear. i won t know until i see a go specialist. my biggest battle right now is my anxiety. i was just curious if this can happen through recovery being 4 months in? and does it ever go away as i recover? i ve been trying not to stress myself out but i m just so overwhelmed by everything.",

"just a little rant and maybe, hopefully, a few words of hope. heyy i really just have a few bits of juicy bs to get off my mind, maybe posting it here could help a little. after ""recovering"" from a restrictive disorder, i gained weight and had a mindset that was a lot more functional. i am not going to mention mumbers but i haven't had a single bite i haven't tracked and counted for about 3 years. i have been counting since i was 14. after that came another low, lost period again, and then boom, i decided to check what other disorder we got in the mix and developed a binge habit. then right on top of the binge habit came the realisation that i can get rid of the dinner of 4 i have just consumed via toilet. what a fucking breakthrough, it set me up for a bulimia ish period. i always end my binges with a fresh new plan to get better. to eat healthier. to maintain my weight, which is perfectly healthy. to make peace with food, to banish it from my thoughts. i don't want to wake up and calculate my day in my head. i don't want to starve an entire day before and after a night of heavy drinking, only to end up binging. i want to get my energy back, my thoughts back. i really really wish, from the bottom of my heart, that every single person who struggles with eating related problems manages to find a way to roundhouse kick that shit. it is unbeleivably hard to accept that you are no longer ""skinny"". you don't get the comments or the high from restricting. you no longer have the safe little mental palace built of lies and numbers and low calorie recipes. or maybe it isn't like that for you. maybe you are struggling because your only solace is food, maybe you are binging beacuse your palace is made of hatred towards yourself. all i can say, that this entire system of addiction, fear, safety and hatred we built around food is only in our minds. guys, we have no idea how many treasures this world holds once we leave the fucking mental palace and turn towards life, not eds. we gotta grow up and move out.",
"my recovery. i didn't know where to post and wanted to share. i have been struggling with this for years. at 17, i had to cut my hair into a pixie cut because it was thinning and falling out so much. this made me realize i needed help. i've struggled for years with trying not to relapse. i have been doing good for a few years. today, i noticed how much thicker my hair looked. i was shocked. i went to look at old pictures to see if it was true.. sure enough, my hair is thicker so, now i'm crying about my hair lol. my body recovered quick but my nails and hair seem to have really taken their time to get back on track. anyways, thought i would share. i feel real stupid crying about my hair, but i remember how bad it was while actively partaking in my disorder... sorry for the long gibberish, i just wanted to share and didn't know where to.",
"in a rough spot right now.. this is mostly just a rant, you can respond if you want to. just sort of trying to prevent myself from losing it. so i have had hip pain since like mid november. it was taken very lightly by my gp as if it was muscular. pain escalated thanksgiving day which required a trip to the er since my fianc , out of stress from the breakdown i was having, took me up there. a ct scan was done to rule out more severe things. i was diagnosed with an acute uti and a cyst on the left ovary. the uti is now gone, which was shown through my gp. i attempted to ask my gp about the pain involving the cyst and it was easily brushed off. now i m back in the situation where basically my whole lower body is aching. i have bad nausea and it s basically just a lot of shit going on right now. i ve learned i have to go out of my way to see a obgyn since my gp refuses to simply give a referral. thankfully i am somewhere where it isn t required. although me and my fianc did find one thanks to our upper coach that helped it s going to possibly take possibly a couple days for me to actually see one. so i have just been doing every remedy known to man to help. the whole thing that pisses me off tho is that i feel like if my doctor would have taken me seriously, this would ve possibly never escalated as bad as it is currently. also pisses me off since she s a woman herself. i have been straight up overwhelmed by pain and emotional distress since monday. i ve had to step down from dancing once again. mental health is just falling back down with all of this. i m just so tired. i don t want to give up on recovery but i do believe i am at the most stressful point for myself. i have never experienced anything like this my entire life. i am only 19 with no family history of things so i just really hope this is shortly lived. i can possibly be put on something that helps with hormones, possibly? anyways that s really all i wanted to let out.",

"my story, advice?. i d like to say back in february march was when my eating got bad. i had just got out of a very bad relationship which led to me barely caring about myself. i basically used to binge eat a lot of fast food and unhealthy stuff. it wasn t until august where it backfired. i had severe heartburn and temporary acid reflux causing me to be very restrictive. my doctor noticed the weight drop from when i recovered from that and obviously raised the concern about my old ed relapsing i used to be very restrictive in the past years . my girlfriend was in the room with me when that was mentioned so basically ever since the end of august, i have been recovering with the help of her and also some friends. it s been about 2 months. the first month was easy for me only because i was determined and also because my metabolism wasn t able to keep up with me. little detail, i have a fast metabolism which is what triggers the spiraling affect of my ed mostly because i will give up with trying. now that i am in the second month, it is getting hard again. my metabolism has definitely caught up with me. eating 3 meals a day with a couple healthy snacks doesn t exactly do much. it ll stabilize my weight but it doesn t go up. the biggest thing that interferes though is that i work in the performing arts, specifically dance. i do eat healthy meals for the main 3 which works fine. the issue usually is between lunch and dinner. i am back to full out working and rehearsing things, so it s not that easy to eat something then go back to what i was doing because it would be easy to make myself sick. i m not sure if anybody else works a job like that, but if anybody has ideas or advice of what i could eat during that time period that also helps me get more calories, feel free to comment. it s been beating me up a little bit mentally because i want to be able to get ahead of my metabolism since i ve spent years letting it cause me to be underweight for years. even if you have any tips to naturally slow it down that ll be nice. one last thing i m curious about, when does your hair stop falling out significantly? it s not as bad as it was in the beginning but it s still there. i know my stress levels did play a role not long ago but is there like a way to fix it or does it just fix itself on its own?",
"just curious.. so i ve been recovering. i haven t restricted any foods lately but one thing i can t help but to notice is my allergies. i do have seasonal allergies, no food allergies. but i was just wondering with anybody else that does have allergies, did yours ever get like really bad during recovering? it sort of drives me crazy especially with everything else going on.",
"life has really been shitting on me lately. first, i went to a treatment center where a girl hated me and said she d ruin my life. then, i lost my girlfriend because her parents didn t support our relationship and now im no longer allowed to see her or talk to her. then, 2 days later i lost my bestfriend because she said it was exhausting being my friend. then i was told by my other bestfriend i looked like i gained weight. then my other friend completely threw me under the bus and i no longer speak to her. after that, my brother told me i dont exercise enough. now, the friend who told me i looked like i gained weight won t speak to me. i need to gain weight in order to play lacrosse, the one thing i love. im feeling so discouraged. i have no one left but my eating disorder. im going to relapse. i know none of you care about my problems but i d at least like someone to answer.",
"1 years in recovery. it s been so long feeling free. sometimes i feel trapped and scared and engage, but i catch myself and i do better because i know better. i don t want anyone to think it isn t possible to recover. i m not there yet but i see hope in doing and being so. ive never felt more free from my ed, most days it feels so so far away from my minds it s as if it never happened. but it did. 1 years in recovery, 1 years since my first step towards fixing, 1 years i admitted myself into treatment. my family didn t help me, my friends didn t help me, it was all self driven admittance because i finally realized i could be saved. it was so scary, for so long. no one in my life had ever heard of anyone going to treatment for their ed, or at least no one ever talked about it. my teachers were so confused with what to do but i guided them even through my mania. i guided everyone through this on top of doing it for myself. it was so uncomfortable, so emotionally exhausting and physically too. i never thought i d get out of feeling so shitty, full of anxiety and anger. but i stuck with treatment, i stuck with making sure i was taking accountability and not rewarding myself for bad behavior. i made sure that i was eating and sticking to my meal plan. no one policed me, no one was looking out for me so i did it myself, going to therapy, seeing my nutritionist and doctor very frequently to track my progress, taking my meds and writing my thoughts. it s been and was hard. lots of times i lapsed, so many times. but i have yet to relapse and it s also my biggest fear. i never want to be as deprived as i once was, lifeless and mean and horrible. seeing death was the wake up call for me. living life in a wheelchair was absolutely rock bottom and i never want to be her ever again, looking at yourself from an outside perspective really helped me. i love life, i love enjoying life. at this point, i haven t had or owned a scale in 7 years. i haven t counted a single calorie in 2 years. i haven t abused laxatives exercise in 6 years. i haven t been on a diet in 4 years. and i feel so so so good most days. i feel free, i feel so normal and looking at my old journals are so scary that i fight everyday as hard as i can. i looked at my old ed tumblr and i didn t even recognize my posts, i don t even know that person anymore and it feels so good. i indulge in food, i enjoy my food, i sit with my feelings and the fullness and i love it. i ve never felt days like this until now. no one will probably read this but i really needed to reassure myself tonight after a very hard month that i m still in this and i m still dedicated to being better. i love life, i love recovery no matter how many times i scream and cry about it. it s possible and i hope other people can find their reasons to keep going because all you need is one, mine was art.",

trying to recover and eating out every day. i ve been trying to recover from a restrictive eating disorder and i haven t counted calories in over a week which is the longest i ve gone in a year and a half since relapsing. i know i should be accepting of weight gain but i eat out every day. i don t cook and i don t feel ready to grocery shop for non safe foods. i only have safe foods in the house and i am afraid they will trigger me to count calories restrict. also i just want to eat out because obviously it tastes good and i don t like to cook. i m just worried i am going to gain so much weight so fast and obviously that is terrifying. did does anyone else s recovery look like this? i m trying really hard not to limit myself on anything and let myself have whatever i crave but it also feels like i m just giving myself an excuse to be gluttonous.,

"i know i need to recover but i am terrified and don t feel like i can do it. lss i was anorexic and got to a very low weight and lost my period for a year, it became very hard to maintain restriction so i started what u thought was bingeing but realize now was probably extreme hunger. this made me gain a lil weight which made my existing depression unbearable and i had a suicide attempt. after that restriction was even harder so i quasi recovered and gained what felt like a lot of weight and was also drinking every day and still felt bad about myself but had a more normal relationship with food. i stopped drinking nearly as much and that made me lose some weight which triggered my ed which i slowly fell back into full force. coupled with starting to be really active skiing i got back to my lowest weight. since ski season ended i have slowly been gaining weight and also drinking more which it s the only way i can eat without restriction. i am at a point where it is so clear to me how miserable my eating disorder makes me. i am constantly depressed and all i can think about is all of the life i am wasting out on and wish so badly that i could be normal but i am so fucking terrified to recover. i would rather not be alive than face recovery is pretty much how i feel. i want to be alive but not as myself. which feels so pathetic because outside of my ed i am so happy with my life but it feels impossible to enjoy it. i ve already gained a little weight and so the thought of gaining more is terrifying. i just feel so so so stuck.",
hid my bathroom scales today. i've been trying to get over orthorexia and red s for years. i was governed by what i weighed for years and have been struggling to overcome it even since i 'faced up' to it and started trying to fix myself a few years ago. today i put my bathroom scales somewhere that it's gonna take me about 5mins to retrieve them minimum . i hope that having them out of eyesight at least is a starting point to me getting over an obsession with what i weigh and then that trickling on to my obsession with what i eat. just wanted to share.,

"re introducing peanut butter during recovery i m freaking out. hey everyone, i ve been in recovery for a few months now. i was a little underweight, b p multiple times per day before i sought help. now, i b p a lot less and eat regularly. my meal plans have been changing slowly; the biggest challenge for me was an eating schedule. once i got that down mostly, only then was i given a new plan. well, my most recent plan included an huge fear food of mine: peanut butter. now don t get me wrong, i love peanut butter. i just haven t eaten it in so long because i avoided it. i am still deathly afraid of it, but i can t stop eating it. and i can t purge it either because i m working on cutting down my purging and, well, if you know you know. anyway, peanut butter was only added to my plan maybe a week ago. i ve already gone through three full jars. three. it s like my body and brain are just screaming at me to eat it. i m binging on it nonstop, and i m never full. and you know what s weird, i don t crave the same foods i would typically b p on. it s like none of those matter anymore. i can have my regular meals and i still want that peanut butter and sometimes whipped cream . it s like my brain knows i can t purge this, it s going to stay down, and that it s craving fat. i ve been reading recovery blogs where many people are saying this is totally normal, but it s not stopping me from feeling like shit, and feeling so frustrated. has this happened to anyone else? any advice? does it go away? i can t eat this much peanut butter regularly.",
"struggling in recovery probably rlly triggering. so i don t really have anyone to talk to irl. i need to know if anyone relates or tips to recovery. i ve regained my hunger so like i know when im full and i know when im hungry because before it would be i either didn t eat at all and never got hungry or i ate and didn t know when i was full. i know it s good i ve regained that balance but it makes me feel incredibly guilty that i get hungry easily again. also, im not able to see my ribs or my shoulder bones and it s making me extremely upset and i know it shouldn t but it is. my jeans are beginning to fit me again. when all of this should be positive it s so negative to me and making this harder and harder.",

"warning: big rant vent sesh because i'm triggered af. cw: numbers in relation to kcal, exercise behaviours. hi massive apologies in advance for this rant, i'm very panicky and i just needed to rant in a space where people will understand that i'm aware its irrational and makes no sense but also can't think a different way right now, so i could calm down and sort myself out lol so i'm trying to recover after a massive lockdown triggered relapse last year, and i was doing really well. but i'm also moving country and just got put in a strict mandated isolation facility which is fine ofc, i knew what i was getting into, and i made sure i did loads of research and had a plan to cope because if anything could relapse me, locked in a small room with limited exercise opportunity and no control over my food is a def risk. the plan has a few aspects but really hinged on me renting a crosstrainer for my hotel room, which the website for these facilities said was allowed and i found a rental that would do it. facility rundown i got a menu and was able to select foods for the next two weeks. i chose the healthiest lightest options and opted out of desserts. i calculated the first two days as best i could and even then i'd say we're looking at 2 kcal a day. my maintenance when i am active locked in a hotel room so not so much here... is 18 . so ofc i'm freaked out and made a plan to obvs just eat certain bits, leave things like rice etc out. i'm allowed half an hour outside a day but i am not allowed to run. my room is small and i can fit the xtrainer and could slide it aside to do insanity but cant really run in here or get meaningful walking pace. note here.. i have behaviours associated with exercise. i workout obsessively but my brain refuses to count anything as calories burned unless it is a crosstrainer or a treadmill. like i can literally run for an hour outside but if i'm not on a machine no matter how much i consciously know i burned calories, my brain will just.. nope. not on a machine, doesn't count. calories burned do an hour on the treadmill xtrainer . treadmills i lkterally have to use for 9 12 minutes before my brain counts it but for reasons unknown to me as to why this is a thing, x trainer i can use two lots of 3 mins in a day and i'm fine. so my plan so i could eat was: yoga am, 3 min xtrainer heavy cardio am, shaun t insanity workout, and then just ''walk'' gently with no resistance on the xtrainer all day while watching tv or whatever so i'm in motion. then 3 min cardio again before bed. hotel just denied me the xtrainer. i was so confused, website said it was allowed and they've just turned around and said i can't have it. what really pisses me off here is i had a welfare meeting on arrival where i was very clear about my issues and concerns and specified i was hiring a xtrainer and the nurses were like 'yep thats fine keep us updated on how you're doing'. so this ofc just sent me into complete panic mode. now they've said i can hire an exercycle. obviously i have immediately changed my order and i won't hear back till tomorrow if they have one available and i'm really hoping they do but if they don't i'm fucked. even if they do my stupid ed brain which is now in total overdrive will refuse to consider it as calories burned and the only option i can see is to call the kitchen staff and ask them to not send me any food.. or just not open my door to get any or chuck it all or don't eat it and spend all day every day doing fuckin insanity videos and cycling as fast as i can on a bike. i'm just straight up freaking out at this point, i know once i calm down i can reassess and i'll call the nurse to talk about what to do but i really needed to get it out, sorry guys. thank you for .. just having this space for me to panic so i can calm down and actually go deal with it haha. ugh, wish me luck, this is going to be a hard 2 weeks",
"identity and who i am. who am i if i'm not skinny. i feel so shallow to care so much about how i look. if i was alone and the only person left in the world it would be so easy. as a former long distance runner and skinny my entire life i feel like being skinny is my identity. when i gained weight in college i immediately thought about it all the time and felt worthless. how do i let this go? how do i not care what other people think? i know my worth is in my kindness, my actions, how i treat others and myself. my worth isn't the way i look yet it matters so much to me. i keep thinking that if i'm not skinny people won't like me. obviously that's not true and i know that, but gaining weight is harder in actual practice. i think i need to work on my self worth. i don't think i matter much at all for some reason. when someone likes me i get scared because i don't even like myself i think. i have a deep rooted sense of shame and feeling like i'm never enough. i'm not quite sure where that stemmed from. i would never admit to my friends and family that i had have a eating disorder. it's just so embarrassing to not be able to do such a primitive behavior. it's been less than a year and i'm going to get through it. i know i am capable. i've done hard things. i commit myself when i want to see results. the results i'm looking for is zero control over what i eat. i want food to become unconscious for me. i want to eat to eat. no deeper meaning nothing. just food. a few billion people do it every day. i can do it just as well. well, this was a great time. i usual write this out in my journal but i'm posting it on here spontaneously. if anyone relates, please comment.",
"tw family triggering ed. so i ve stuggled with disordered eating since 12yo i m almost 16 now. ever since seeing my mom make jabs at my sister who has bed due to my parents somewhat abandoning her not really but in a sense to take care of my health issues as a baby. she gives her a side eye and says you don t need that when she gets more food than her. she constantly says she s being lazy, and always encourages her when she wants to diet which results in relaps after being shown a video in school which vilified obesity i developed anorexia thinking that there was obviously something horrible about weight gain. i ve since gained all that weight back and then some because i m still getting taller and... you know, growing. but the problem is my moms newest thing. she s so exited about keto. she just bought a ton of new keto safe foods, and guilted my sister into joining her. she s been eating cereal bread rice fruit, bc diet starts sunday . but the whole thing is sooo triggering. restricting food groups was a big part of my ed and i ve felt in an ok place recently. but this has completely blown up my head. i ve tried to talk to her about how competitive eds are but she always responds by saying our situations aren t the same and your sister wants to lose weight she s not happy which further engravings the weight is bad thought in the back of my head. and besides that i know my sister, we are very close. i haven t said anything to her bc she seems to have a bit of hope in it. but i know it won t last for her... that s not how you cure bed. and she s already cried a lot over it. there restricted sugar and dairy to, so it makes me even more competitive... i don t know what to do or say.",

"please help how to recover while in a abusive house?. tw: abuse, neglect, restricted kitchen, food policing .... hey, does anyone have advice on how to recover from your ed while living in a house with a restricted kitchen? my grandmother has really bad untreated ocd and polices the kitchen and will scream at anyone who ""makes a mess"" in her kitchen. the only time anyone is allowed in the kitchen is when my mom cooks dinner and she is only allowed to cook what my grandparents want. i have been struggling to eat for the past 6 months, 4 and a half of those months i lived on my own but now i am back living at home. i thought it would be better cause someone else was cooking but since my mom only cooks what my grandparents tell her to it's been even harder to force myselfto eat. all my grandparents wants to eat is usually really heavy foods pizzas, pasta, fried breaded foods, beans, tacos that i can't make myself eat. i am a adult with my own money but i can't drive so can't shop for food myself or go out and get something. the one time i tries to use doordash to order something i was yelled at for ""being ungrateful and rude"" because i didn't order everyone food. if i lose anymore weight my doctor will make me go to treatment and i don't have the money for that. and not only that, but i also promised my girlfriend i would start eating again and i really want to keep that promise it's just so hard when i can't even go into my own kitchen without getting screamed at i really don't know what to do at this point.",

"how did you get out of the binge restrict cycle?. for me i am not very sure if i am stuck in the binge and restrict cycle, but for me i think the main thing is that i always deny myself of what i want to eat, purposely not finishing my food, not eating what or when i want, starving myself from time to time, denying hunger etc. i am not sure if it's restricting but i definitely feel very deprived. then there will be one day where i give into one treat and then i just end up eating lots of snacks or food at one time. is this the binge and restrict cycle? how did you get out of it?",

it really does get easier the more you do it . better nutrition really does halt the obsessive thoughts a lot within even a couple of days this is your sign to give your brain the energy it needs to stop that thought loop you've been stuck in,

"eating but also keeping healthy. i m not sure if i m looking for advice or just to rant a bit. and i m not sure if this is the right place to post because i don t have a traditional ed but rather arfid which just means i m a very picky eater, but with deep psychological triggers behind it. i have seen a lot of things mostly on sites about recovering from depression about how it s always better to eat something than waiting around to eat the perfect thing or what have you. i have a very busy schedule and my selective eating means that there are very very very few healthy options for me anywhere but at home so i ve been just snacking a lot and grabbing a lot of food out. this has resulted in breakouts and a yeast infection. this is what always happens when i ve been eating poorly but sometimes i forget until it actually happens. and when i m busy like i have been lately it seems my two options are to not eat enough or to continue eating poorly and do this to my body. i feel kinda stuck. i m not sure what s the best thing to do. again, this is partly just a bit of a rant but if anyone has any advice to offer i d be happy to hear it.",
"panicking. i just realized today i have consumed over 2 calories and i am not particularly active. apparently for a woman who isn't active the recommended caloric intake is 16 . if i were theoretically consuming 2 calories a day and not burning the extra 4 calories off would the extra calories cause my weight to continue to go up indefinitely or would it stabilize assuming i continued to consume the same amount of daily? i'm skinny but i've gained like 15 pounds in the last 4 months and i think i gained 1 within a month and a half and it worries me. i used to basically starve myself because i was too depressed to eat and in the past few months i've started eating more which i would assume accounts for the weight gain but it terrifies me how quickly i put it on, especially this month. i have no idea how many calories i regularly consume on a daily basis and i'm terrified that if i don't count them my weight will never stop going up. is this rapid weight gain normal for my situation? or is it attributed to my antidepressants? i am terrified of my antidepressants will or are making me rapidly gain weight but i'm also terrified to go off them because i was even worse off before them. i think i've been on them since september of last year but no weight gain since recently and the weight gain seems to have coincided with me starting to eat more is this my antidepressants ruining my metabolism or my body trying to adjust to eating enough? how the hell do calories work? sorry i'm all over the place. help also i'm really hungry right now like my blood sugars are low and i'm getting hunger pangs but i've already eaten over 2 calories today. should i eat now or wait until tomorrow?",

"why i did it. i always felt like the reason i went into an eating disorder is my complex with my tits. i have super small tits. i'm 5'11"". i was trying to shrink myself out of shame. shame because i didn't look womanly and shapely and short and beautiful.",
"i need help. i need help im sorry if this is poorly written. i am extremely tired, and it is taking all my energy to concentrate on writing this. i relapsed badly. i had been in quasi since 2 18, but 3 months ago i snapped and i am at a worse point than i ever was before. i cant think well. i can only think in short sentences. i cant walk or stand very long. i have to concentrate and make an effort on breathing and it feels like my heart is tired of beating. i cant talk for long. i cant watch shows. i cant sleep. i feel so much nausea. i am in pain, my head, stomach and body hurt. i dont have anyone to talk to about this and no access to therapy or treatment. i was on a run a few days ago and then i simply could not take another step. i havent been able to even sit up for long since that day. it's like my body and mind entirely gave up. i know i need recovery but i dont know how to do it. i dont know what to eat. it scares me. all i can do is lay in my bed and cry and sometimes i eat a fruit or rice cake. my family is mad because i am so tired. my mom has terribly disordered habits and sees thinness as the ultimate beauty form, and she resents me for my weight loss bc she cant do it herself. i need some guidance or comfort. anything. how do you start recovery? what can i eat? how do i break a food rule?",
"no appetite nausea 1 year into recovery??. i had been anorexic for 4 years and last year entered treatment. i had extreme hunger and went against my dietitian's advice to decrease my intake and ""not get so big past my goal weight"" pretty fatphobic of her imo . i had been reading a lot of tabitha farrar's blog and ""the f ck it diet"" and was hugely inspired by the ""all in"" method. so fast forward a year. the past 8 1 months i've been struggling with almost zero appetite. all foods are neutral to me now, but they are now neutrally nausea inducing. i have to force myself to eat. i struggle to eat regularly my job doesn't help . i have no idea why. i am depressed, but honestly have been better than i've been in a long time. i take wellbutrin, so maybe that's suppressing appetite? i am stressed living at home with my parents while i prepare to go to an accelerated nursing program. maybe it's stress? maybe my body is making me not hungry to lose all the overshoot weight? i overshot by a looooooot. but that doesn't make sense because i just keep gaining and gaining. maybe i'm not eating regularly enough to keep my metabolism running and my body shuts down and goes into starvation mode? i have no idea. does anyone relate or have a solution? also what can help in the meantime to actually eat? i'm so sick literally of being nauseous when i've been working so hard on recovery ",
"feelings of guilt. this is my first time ever posting on a reddit thread but i need serious advice or something. i feel so alone. i have been in anorexia recovery for almost 3 months now and obviously, gaining back healthy weight is not bad at all. but seeing the weight gain.. and gaining more weight than you expected.. how do you cope with the feelings of guilt.. i feel extremely guilty and it makes me want to relapse all over again. to be more clear i am happier in recovery so much happier. i feel better and i have more energy and i m glad i chose recovery. but seeing all the changes in my body is what really gets me. any words or advice helps. i thought i would give this a shot. thank you.",
"tw: cal ries, p rging, we ght l ss, exe cise. hi everyone, i ve been struggling with p rging since the beginning of the year as a way to cope with my generalized anxiety disorder and body image. i ve been struggling with my weight for my whole life, and p rging has become a more frequent thing for me. i m in counselling to seek help for my mental health, and i ve been trying to eat 12 c ls a day to lose weight. it s been working well for me the past few weeks, and since i don t work too much of the day, i have a lot more time to be mindful of what i m eating. the problem is, i m always tired and i never have energy to exercise anymore. i m taking random naps in the middle of the day, and i m still tired at night. my body s so used to my cal rie intake now, that if i eat any more, even if i don t force myself, i will v mit reflexively. of course, it makes sense that i have less energy to expend now that i m eating less, but my constant fatigue seems so excessive, i m wondering if i m imagining it or just being lazy. please let me know if you have ever experienced this before or you have any advice. my best wishes to all of you beautiful people ",
you guys are my only support system right now. i ate breakfast this morning then i had a higher calorie lunch than im used to. i know its stupid to seek validation from strangers online but i need some support because i can feel the guilt creeping up.,
"scared of relapse. so some background: i have been in therapy for the past year and it was really great: i just had my last session this week because i m going on a 4 ish month road trip so continuing treatment wasn t an option but i feel like i ended it in a really good place. generally i m happy rn. i think. i talked a little bit about my body image and disordered eating habits with my therapist but only a few times because he doesn t specialize in eating disorders. he expressed concerned when i told him about what i was doing at my worst, and how i was doing currently. then he checked in a couple more times in the past three months since i d told him. so here s the dealio: i m so worried about relapsing quotation marks because i ve never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder into my old habits. i automatically have a limited diet for the road because of space and money and i know that i ll be hiking a lot and there s a really high chance my weight will go down and then i ll go back to harmful behaviors to keep whatever lower weight i end up at. there s a chance nothing will happen but i ve only recently past 3 4 months been eating three meals a day and not counting coffee with milk creamer in it as a meal i already feel my skin crawling at the thought of it. no ones going to be with me to see if i eat or not and i m so scared that i ll just wreck my body. i want to be healthy and happy and love my body. eventually i want to talk to a ed specialist if not to get a diagnosis just to get some advice. i don t know what i m looking for here other than maybe like, some helpful words? idk i m sure others feel similar?",
"scared ill be stuck in between forever. my relapse has just been a constant battle between wanting to be sick and wanting to be well. it's been around three months since i started to notice behaviours coming back and my body has reacted quickly. i dont like feeling sick and tired and i dont like obsessing over food constantly. i dont like not having my period and losing my libido and sex being uncomfortable and feeling unable to think of anything but calories. but it seems like my behaviours are so weird and in between and honestly not very severe that if i don't spell everything out, no one would think i have a problem by the way that i eat. my meals seem like normal things to eat and honestly they kind of always have. i was only skipping meals for brief periods and my restriction just looks like someone making ""healthy"" low calorie choices. i can't seem to stop being afraid to up my intake though, and i keep doing things to cut corners and avoid gaining weight. i'm at this weird stasis where i'm really fine with not losing but terrified to gain, not wanting to get worse but not feeling i'm allowed to get better. i feel like because i never gave in and tried to go all the way, eating as little as possible, this addiction to restricting and keeping my weight low makes no sense and i know i could hide it so easily. a lot of people eat more than me and are healthy and so i feel like that means i don't deserve to eat more . honestly i feel like i made up the ""eating disorder"" in my head and now i'm just stuck in this cycle of doing little things to prove to myself i still have one.",
"i feel like we never truly recover. it's been years since i was at the worst of my anorexia. i gained an incredible amount of weight even too much to be honest and my life has changed a lot. yet, all the issues are still here: everyday i struggle to look at myself in the mirror, everyday i feel sick to my stomach to even acknowledge a body that isn't my idea of perfect. does that ever goes away? it feels really lonely to be in recovery, all treatment seems geared at people at the acute phase but how am i to keep from falling back if my mind never heals?",
"feeling like i have to hold onto some of my behaviours while waiting for treatment?. im currently waiting on an intake appointment for outpatient treatment for my eating disorder. things have become pretty bad with my weight quickly because i'm on thyroid meds for hypothyroidism which, when i lose weight, end up overmedicating me until i'm able to adjust them, so i lose weight kind of exponentially. because this outpatient program treats ""mild to moderate"" eating disorders and bmi is one of the criteria for marking an ed as ""severe"", i really want to take recovery as seriously as i can on my own and stop behaviours like compulsive exercise and skipping meals. however, i feel constantly in my head like i have to self sabotage and prevent myself from recovering ""too well"" because otherwise it will be embarrassing to go to this appointment which my doctor pushed so hard to expedite. she asked me to go to the er this week mostly to see if the ed clinic would see me sooner, and while i was hospitalized the psychiatrist at the hospital sent two different requests for someone at the clinic to see me. i feel like if i am able to keep from using these behaviours for three weeks, the team is going to feel that my doctor and i wasted their time and harassed them for no reason and so i feel conflicted about getting better : if i come in and they ask me ""do you do x y and z"" and i say no, its not going to make any sense ",

my binge eating is tearing me apart please help me.. i can t stop binge eating and even though i practice all the self help advice i find i keep failing: i 21 f grew up in a household where i was constantly told i was fat and my guardian even started rationing my food when i was around 8 yrs old. i was also entered in dance classes when i was 5 and stayed in them for 8 years until my guardian mentioned that they only put me in those classes to keep me from getting fat. throughout my life they would make comments about what color clothes made me appear thinner and about how much i ate and telling me overweight girls at school would be so pretty if only they weren t to fat . not only that but they also talked about my appearance in my face. one time not letting me wear glasses at the dinner table because they can t stand to see you looking like that . they died when i was 15 years old and since then i haven t stopped binge eating. it s like having freedom to eat whatever without having comments about it made me go from underrating to overeating. i have never been skinny but now i m at an all time record. i m 5 2 and weight 16 . possibly even more now but my brother banned me from looking at scales because i would get so depressed after weighing myself. i also was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my medication makes me gain weight and it s destroying me. i hate mirrors and the way i look. i love beauty and fashion and it breaks my heart that i will never be able to wear what i want without looking like a whale.i find myself wishing i were anorexic because i at least would get to be thin. now i just have an eating disorder that i gain weight from so i feel even worse every day. i watch videos about recovery and how my worth is not connected to my size but to me it does. i can t afford therapy. what can i do? i know i m sick and i know my mentality is wrong but every time i look in a mirror or try on clothes all i see is a gross person unworthy of other peoples gazes. please help me any advice is welcome i just want to crawl in a hole and disappear : ,

"those who have overcome an ed how have you changed your relationship with food in a way that has allowed you to recover more easily?. i used to, and i guess still occasionally do, suffer from anorexic impulses where i d go days or weeks at a time not eating because i didn t want to gain weight, because i hated the feeling of food in my stomach, because it was easier than trying to count out calories, because i hate being seen eating the list, as i m sure a lot of not all of yours do as well, goes on and on. however for the past few months i decided that in order to counteract all those things and stop hurting was to change my relationship with food by trying to work out and gain muscle. it s helped me a lot because it gives me a reason to eat, aside from because i have to, and a reason to gain weight, and now the calorie counting has a purpose. i m not advocating this as a cure all for everyone, i m just saying it has helped me. i still hate the feeling of food in my stomach, but keeping my mind otherwise occupied helps a lot. this question goes out there to anyone else who has or has temporarily recovered: how have you changed your relationship with food? what has helped you stop avoiding it? thanks in advance for your time.",

"a little victory : . i posted here a bit ago about how distressing food had become. today i took a few little steps to start rebuilding my relationship with it i deleted my app that i was using to track calories which is the biggest thing , decided to stop keto and reintroduce snacks i can find joy in without restricting, and finally got my mom to agree to help me look for a therapist. i m a bit nervous to stop keto as the restriction felt like a safety blanket, but i think that in and of itself was a sign that it was doing more harm then good. i still feel intense guilt when i do eat, but getting into therapy again and focusing on enjoying how food tastes while still eating appropriate portions will hopefully help me get better with that. i think addressing the anxiety that i believe the eating disorder grew from will help most. anyways, i m going to find a way to cover the caloric information of foods so that i can see the portions without fixating caloric content too much. i m very nervous but i m equally excited to start getting better.",

"triggers ""not hungry"". my biggest trigger are all these posts claiming: i'm not hungry, please help. from my experience, that's a competitive thing hurting people say to make you feel bad. like that they're better because you're fighting off hunger but they don't even have to try. i'm in recovery now, but it still upsets me. because no matter how much i put myself through with my disorder, i just got hungrier and hungrier. anorexic, bulimic, whatever. it was always a fight against hunger, because my body did not want to be tortured, it wanted to live. i'm always hungry. i'm never not hungry. unless i'm severely depressed and it's very very obvious that depression makes you lose interest in things...and not that you're not hungry. and it's triggering for me to see all these people bragging about not being hungry, because we all know ed's are about competition. who can be the best at self harm. who can talk the loudest. can we talk about being healthy instead? because if you're not hungry...you know the answer is you just have to force yourself to eat. sorry...i don't feel bad for you. recovery is hard and it's important to stick to meal times and go for it. the psychological issues or supportive words i'm here to help work through. but none of this bragging about never being hungry. i feel like you're trying to garner sympathy while being cutesy. i hate that feeling of: i'm not as sick as them. i wish i was that sick. no, none of us need that nonsense. that's mid disorder talk and not recovery talk. i just want to be encouraged to be healthy.",

"wanting to relapse after over 2 years of being recovered. anyone have some similar experiences?. hi, this is my very first reddit post despite having been on the site for years my account was created only recently . i am brand new to this subreddit because i have been very steadily recovered for over 2 years at this point. honestly, i consider myself very lucky as my recovery has been fairly smooth with minimal bumps and bruises in between. i won t go to into my past because i d like to keep this short and get right to the point. this past week has been a bit rough for me mentally and emotionally and i have recently begun thinking heavily about my weight and food. this is super surprising to me because i have not had these kinds of thoughts for at least a year. i am disgusted with myself because, put bluntly, i want my ed to come back. it makes me angry to even type that. i can t explain it very well. i am upset because i have worked hard to get to this point. i have worked hard to dismiss my old mindset and move on from the past and yet, i feel myself willing to go through all it again just so i can be underweight. here are somethings i think have recently triggered me: because i have been confident in my recovery, i have been following the subreddit r eugeniacooney for a bit now. have never seen her as thinspo and it was never my intention to see her as inspiration. having gone through an ed myself, i just find it fascinating to see someone so publicly go through one. the comments on the subreddit also point out the awful health side effects of not treating your body right, which i actually see as inspiration to stay recovered. still, seeing this content has made me more aware of the ed mindset i have in the back of my head. my old friend who openly has an ed has started to drop weight. we don t talk anymore, but i still see her occasionally at school and i can tell she is going through a rough patch right now. for some reason i am beginning to see this as some sort of challenge. i almost want to prove to our mutual friends that i am sicker than her. that i can practice more self discipline. i recently told this guy i ve been dating that i love him. he said it back and i felt on top of the world. i have been open with him about my past history with my ed and he was very understanding and caring and sees no reason to be concerned because of how well i ve recovered. knowing that he loves and cares for me as much as i care for him has made me want to be the best version of myself possible. i ve started to think that he deserves me dainty er and skinnier. i have no idea why i have begun to correlate my self worth and lovable ness with my weight again. i am curious about any thoughts comments on this and if anyone has had a similar experience deep into their recovery. any advice is also welcome thank you guys. much love to anyone and everyone in this community ",

"loved ones dieting while i'm in recovery. one of my friends is always complaining about her weight and she's subtle trying to lose weight. she knows about my ed and she's aware that i'm recovering... idk if i should tell her that those things trigger me, i feel like it would be egocentric or selfish. also all my classmates are really influenced by diet culture, so them often make that kind of comments... for example, before the easter holidays, one teacher gave us a little easter egg to each one of us she's a cutieee , but after picking mine i heard someone saying ""oh, no, i'm on a diet"", and then someone like ""i'm being so bad, i should go and work out after this "". really triggered me : lt; not all of them know about my ed, but... i don't feel confident anymore around them. then, lastly, my mother often eat too little or skip meals :' lt; it's usually because of her job she has little time to eat, but even like that... i hate it when we are dining and her plate is ridiculously little compared to mine... any advice? thank you for reading boo, have a nice day ",

"why does my body react so badly when i go back to past behaviour?. i would like to say i'm completely better, eating has somewhat gone back to normal; however, whenever i try to go back to running everyday, my body sometimes has a bad reaction, like feeling a lot weaker than it should especially when restricting . even when i'm not restricting, sometimes i get the side effects that i used to get despite not missing anything e.g. hair loss, dizziness when getting up or binging . is it related to running, restricting or something completely different like stress?",
"how do i tell my partner about i'm concerned about some of his behaviors things he says?. the first few things he said were very small, things about skipping milk in his coffee because of the calories and that he didn't like being heavier in college, so he watches his calories. while i don't think anyone should feel the need to count calories or feel bad about being heavier, not necessarily anything disordered. recently though, he's started forgetting meals which could be real, although i have trouble believing that this is truly innocent if it's a common occurrence , as well as saying he's lactose intolerant, while still eating cheesy foods, ice cream, etc. to me, that's a huge red flag and i've seen it in myself and others as an attempt to restrict foods, and could very easily be the start of a cycle of restriction and guilt. he struggles with depression and anxiety already, and has been unable to exercise or socialize a whole lot for the last year, due to covid. to complicate things, we are currently long distance, so i can't really observe his daily behavior, i only hear what he tells me. am i just projecting, or is this something i should bring up with him? if so, how do i even go about starting that conversation?",
"is there when privacy .... so i made this recovery tiktok page apart from my main and posted this video of me and it said how i didn t wanted to live with this ed and that i have relapsed and i even used my middle name so no one i know from my main account t found it, especially one of my friends . and she liked the video it s so embarrassing, now she ll probably show her 3 something sister and body shame me again for having a small butt and not being bulky or built like them. they have to get a thing straight also, i was in a swim team for almost 3 years and swim basically takes away your and . i m just... i don t even know why i m writing this. all i know is that when i tried to have my recovery page on instagram, she stalked my account and she s like are you okay? and anonymous name found your account and sent it to me like ugh i just can t.",
"food shop rant long term recovered . i ve not had any ed issues in quite a long time and it s been over a year and a half since my last relapse, most of the thinking doesn t occur to me anymore and i generally eat well however i was trying to help my mum with our online food delivery the other day and we were looking at snacks, she was quite stressed because you have to finish the shop in a certain time to keep your slot and she was trying to make dinner at the same time, so when the oven timer went off she just handed me the laptop and told me to choose for her. admittedly i was very tired at the time and don t react well to being yelled at anyway, but i just took one scroll down the page of breakfast bars and snacks and burst into tears. why does everything have to have the calories on the front of the box?? it s such a hard habit to kick looking at the back of the box but it s impossible to ignore the big bragging number on the front, and all the different labels and numbers was just so overwhelming that i had to have a little cry. i ended up adding just one box that didn t have the calories on the box and then went to the cereals page instead. anyone else deal with this frustration?",
"sugary fatty foods. hi: does anyone else who is attempting recovery follow through and just eat what they want? i don t want to but i do at the same time if that makes sense ? i m so scared of doing it and feel guilty if i eat anything more than my meal plan, i m also so scared of the weight gain but i don t know what the right thing to do is? people have reinforced the idea that the meal plan is a minimum but i am scared of bingeing and i feel that all the food i want i shouldn t have as in my head i label them as foods to avoid even though that is not the best thing to do realistically... it will just make the restriction binge cycle stronger however, i ve not binged in a while, i ve felt more in control which i m pleased about but at the same time i feel a sort of guilt around that because part of me the disordered part feels that i am in control of eating bad food which i shouldn t be eating what advice would you give ?",
i've been in recovery from anorexia bulimia for 4 months now but i am wondering if i have longterm effects. if i eat a substantial amount of food like a sandwich or something then i get very dizzy and throw up. i've never had this before. is this because of my old habits or do i just have a weak ass stomach,

hospital food?. i wasn t sure what to name this post but whatever. since my school is slowly closing up again and online school becomes more of a daily thing i ve noticed my ed is getting bad again. i m having a hard time eating full meals without feeling sick. my mom doesn t know a lot about eds but she asked if i wanted to try ordering in some hospital food . like the blended up smoothie things they give patients that can t eat normally at the hospital so they get all the nutrients and calories that they need. is this a good idea?,

"food doesn't give me pleasure. tw food, weight mention but no numbers on the whole, eating doesn't give me pleasure anymore. and it absolutely sucks because this lack of pleasure, this ambivalence i have towards food as a whole makes it really difficult for me to want to eat and enjoy the act of doing it. it's not even connected to wanting to lose weight, i don't obsess over food anymore, it's just a lack of interest on the whole. when i do eat it's difficult to eat a normal healthy portion of food because of my stomach being so shrunken, i often don't finish meals all the way. it's hard to say if i'm even struggling with an eating disorder anymore. i mean surely there's something wrong with my food intake but my anorexia before i went into recovery was characterized by obsessive thoughts, weighing, you know. food and my body was all i could think about, and now i don't think about food as much as i probably should. don't know what to do, don't know what to characterize it as either. if anyone has thoughts or advice on the matter please drop a comment as i'm pretty lost",

"this is making recovery difficult for me, has anyone else experienced this?. tw binge , bulimia tldr at the bottom hello all, first time poster here. i feel very dumb but i haven't found the rules for this sub not used to reddit so i sincerely apologize if my posts breaks any of them. i'm a woman recovering from bulimia binge ed and i'm in a place where i'm almost completely fine mentally in regards to the ed. it's been several years now since i had a bad episode. however, i gained a lot of weight because of binging, and even though i lost some of it when i stopped, i'm still very overweight. i'm in this dumb situation where you have to lose weight to be healthy but you're too scared you'll fall back into your dangerous habits. i get anxious even just thinking ""i have to exercise a little for my health"" because it just gives me flashbacks to when i was deep into my ed. i'm trying to come up with reasons to exercise and eat healthy other than losing weight, that way i can focus on those reasons instead. anyways, here's the problem i recently noticed. whenever i see a woman who looks fit and beautiful in my eyes, i get the urge to binge. i would look at instagram or at a youtube video and see a pretty girl, think ""damn, she looks good"", and then immediately get up and go eat an entire pack of cookies. it didn't occur to me that those actions might be connected until not too long ago. you'd think ""duh, classic case of comparing yourself to these girls and that triggers your ed"". but... the thing is, i am attracted to women. so when i do this, i just think i'm checking them out. i didn't even feel like i was comparing myself to them. but i think deep down, i can't help but wishing i looked like them as well. the binges are not extreme compared to what i experienced in the past, which is why it took time to dawn on me that that wasn't healthy. does this happen to anyone else? what do you think could help with coping? i can obviously limit my instagram intake i have been unfollowing a lot of models or celebrities that i noticed made me feel bad about myself or even delete it completely, but there are still a lot of pretty girls out in the everyday world and it would be unrealistic to think i can just avoid all triggers. tldr: recovering from binge eating disorder, get urges to binge automatically when seeing pretty girls. anyone else in this situation? thanks in advance guys.",

"i need your advice . hey, everyone. i have been dieting from about march of this year. i've lost 2 kg now i weigh 51kg and i am 171cm . with this, ive lost my period for about 6 months. i've been severely restricting my calories for about 4 5 months and eating about 3 65 kcal a day healthy food but small portions and lifting weights 3 times a week at the gym 2 times per week cardio. but i feel like i cannot do this anymore, because of the extreme hunger that i have been feeling. all that i can think about is food: i watch lots of eating challenges, look through restaurant menus and pics of their food at my free time. i dont want to feel this way anymore. unfortunately, i am 17 and i cannot get professional help on my ed at this moment. tommorow i am planning on buying all of the foods that i was restricting on: chocolate bars, a pizza, donuts, cookies, ice cream and just letting myself eat however much i want for 2 4 days and then going to eating about 1 12 kcal a day on a healthy diet ""to not get fat"" and stay generally healthy. i am scared of gaining weight, thats why i am not going ""all in"" and just planning on giving myself a break for a few days, especially because from this week the gyms are closed because of the coronavirus.i am also scared of gaining weight, because a lot of people have been commenting on my weight loss.the comments have been negative though, my friends and family say that i look too skinny, but for me it gives me a sense of pride and a feeling of control. ok, i am getting distracted here. i just wanted to ask, whether letting myself to satisfy my extreme cravings and hunger for a few days and then going to not restricting my calories so severely, be an alright approach? and would i not gain a hugely noticible amount of weight? english is not my mother tongue, so sorry for the mistakes ",
i love you. im so proud of all of you for choosing recovery. everyday that you choose to eat or challenge yourself is a big success. youre all doing so great and you all encourage me to keep going. thank you ,
"exercise. recently, i made the decision to stop the exercise that i had been doing in order to further my recovery. i knew that my body was completely shattered, stressed and just needed a rest. it's been 2 weeks as of today, and while i am extremely proud of myself for allowing myself to have this rest and not restrict and have had very little guilt around food, i really really miss exercise. i tried on tuesday but i didn't even get 1 minutes in before just breaking down and crying. i'm in this horrible limbo of wanting to pick my weights back up but also being scared i burn myself out and end up going through a phase of hating being scared of exercise just like i was at the peak of my disordered eating: any advice?",
breakfast. i ate a bowl of cereal for breakfast and im feeling really guilty because i followed my meal plan yesterday and i didnt go to bed with a flat stomach. ive been feeling really guilty about eating in general lately but i try to push past those thoughts and im getting better. i was approaching a relapse but ive tried to do my best to avoid it. some encouragement would really do me well. ,

"first steps?. sorry for the long post, i've been avoiding this topic because i told myself i don't have a problem. i 2 f haven't been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder but last year an acquaintance mentioned how he thought i was ""getting fat"" and that sent me into a year long spiral, i started dieting and counted my calories. i planned my meals days in advance and would refuse to eat or drink anything that ""wasn't planned"". i also insisted on working out several times a week even after i injured my leg i pulled a ligament in my ankle and couldn't walk properly but still went to the gym . i tried to cut out sugar completely for half a year. for a little backstory, i've always been on the smaller side, and i even became underweight as a teenager not intentionally, my metabolism was just high . once i started university and was on the pill for a year i started putting on a bit of weight and finally looking healthier. i don't know why i took that guy's comment to the heart, especially since i was basically a size 8 uk at that point. after stopping the pill which made me gain weight and crave sweets a lot i went down a size now i'm a 6 but i still tried to only eat twice a day for a couple months because i was terrified that i will ""get fat in lockdown"". what i do have is ocd and that's probably what caused this episode, and after talking about it with my therapist i've been feeling more calm and even eat 3 proper meals a day. but some days it's harder, and i think i'm gaining weight and i'm afraid of people pointing it out my family and gf are very supportive and compliment me a lot but sometimes i have this really twisted view of myself and my brain thinks that being overweight is the end of the world, when i should be thankful i'm not underweight anymore. but ultimately i think i'm in the right direction to recover : i feel bad for complaining about this to people since they just look at me funny and say i have nothing to worry about because i'm thin.",
finally making a breakthrough. i have been in a severe relapse for about 18 months now and the other day it hit a real rock bottom when i had a heart episode outside a grocery store and was taken to the hospital and resussed spent a few days in icu. since then i have been feeling pretty out of control and paranoid anxious due to my weight partially i know as ny brain no longer thinks rationally . but yesterday i got up and had food for breakfast and didn t vomit. it s been about a year since i kept any food down and i can t believe it. the urges to be sick were insane but i rode it out. and i can t believe i did i then ate at lunch. and again and dinner and no vomiting. i am now 48 hours purge free and i feel a little hope. i just wanted to share this somewhere because i don t really have anyone in my life who would be proud of this or care. i really am feeling determined for the first time in about a decade to kick this and get my life back.. and finally give in to my hunger and actually heal my body. i m scared but more scared of staying in this ed hell. hope everyone is well. love from nz ,

"there s more to life choose recovery . i d been trapped in an ed mindset for the past 4 years. i have had highs and lows but for the past 6 months steadily, i have actively engaged in ed behaviors. i ve lost weight and have achieved, yet again perhaps, the perfect body to some. but am i happy? nope. shocking, right? so, i m taking a new approach to life. an eating disorder robs you of your identity, ultimately. 95 of your thoughts, in some cases, may be focused and centered around numbers, tracking, restricting, pure obsessiveness, and ultimately, discontent. i feel as if i have no peace; i m not living fully. an eating disorder takes your peace. you will never be fulfilled while engaging in ed behaviors. you may find yourself asking, when will this end? when will i finally be happy with myself? the answer is not to be found in your physical appearance or numbers. you are so much more than a body; you are a soul. in fact, you are your soul. your body will deteriorate; your soul will not. take a moment to think about your crush. do you have a crush on them merely for their body? think about it. if you answer yes to this question, then you have got some thinking to do. most of us would answer a big no we re attracted to true beauty. perhaps the essence of beauty is compassion, gentleness, strength, and selflessness. can we truly be any of these things, these virtues most people desire to possess, if we are constantly fixated on our eating disorders aka, ourselves ? the simple answer is no. true happiness results from dying to ourselves and finding purpose in living for others. we cannot be this wonderful human we, ourselves, dream of meeting someday if we choose to focus on our eds, folks you are more than a number. you are more than a body. your beauty is not skin deep. you deserve to live a free, beautiful life. now, read that again. you, yes, you deserve a life ed free. please, choose it so you can be entirely authentically yourself. choose recovery so you can have a personality again. choose recovery so you slowly learn that food is nothing to be scared of; it s a true gift that brings people who care for each other together. choose recovery so you can share a dinner in town with your date and not panic over the thought of it. choose it so you can eat anything and not feel immense, debilitating guilt after doing so. having been on both sides of the spectrum, recovery always wins. so much more joy is to be found in letting go of your ed and being truly free. there s so much more to life than being stuck in your mind. i decided to choose life and you need to too. i pray you choose life today. choose recovery. choose you although it may be terrifying, i assure you it s so worth it. you are not only worthy, but deserving of the most incredible life you could ve ever dreamed of living. if you re not living it now, what s stopping you from trying a new approach to it? what have you got to lose? the truth is you have nothing to lose, but possibly everything to gain. after all, everything you want is on the other side of fear.

"fitbit. i had pretty heavily disordered eating four years ago. i was in high school, too anxious to seek help and never saw a doctor. after some time i was able to recover to a much healthier state. i ve since been to therapy and my overall mental state is much better. i m considering getting a fitbit to double as a watch for work. i also want to get myself into a healthy relationship with exercise and track my progress. does this seem like a bad idea? i want to trust myself, but are these sort of things too easy to become obsessed with?",
"i ordered pasta. idk i was depressed today so i ordered cheesy pasta and boneless bites. i already ate it and feel really gross because dairy is awful for my skin. i feel like i m going to have an anxiety attack over it and i m making coffee even though it s almost 3pm. i would purge if it wasn t so gross, and last time i did it i strained my throat and couldn t speak. a guy who wanted to get with me works where i work now and i don t like him but i wanted him to hate it. i wanted him to hate how good i look and now i m probably going to break out really bad. i wanted to feel too good for him instead of avoiding eye contact. i m already at a higher weight than usual and everything has been triggering me lately but i m trying to lean towards recovery at least.",
"recovery plateau. hello all. i am not a very seasoned redditor, and i am new to this group today so i'm not sure if this is the place for me or not yet. i am 28. i have been considered ""recovered"" from my bulimia by most of my friends and family for about 6 years now. what they do not realize is that, just because i managed to pull my face out of the toilet most days does not mean that still don't struggle with disordered thoughts and body dysmorphia every second of every day. at my worst i was purging around 2 5 times a day on average. sometimes it was a full blown binge, others just after a snack i didn't think i deserved. i had horrible acid reflux, tooth decay, and scars on my knuckles. now i would say i purge only about once a month, and only in a moment of weakness after overeating. i never intentionally binge and purge anymore. that being said, i have lost a lot of the support i once had from those close to me. not like it's a choice they have made, just that it's not as in their face anymore so they don't think about it as much. while i have come a really long way, and i am very proud of the progress i have made, i still have a long way to go before i can honestly say that i'm comfortable in this body. i feel like this part of the recovery doesn't really get talked about. the part when if feels like everyone but you has forgotten that you were on death's door not that long ago. my question is how do you continue to push? what are some things i can do to improve my mental state? i have put on some weight in the last few years and i am very uncomfortable with my body right now. it's been so bad lately that i dont even want to be naked to shower, let alone be seen or touched by my husband. i worry that this will hurt my marriage unless i get myself together, because i am constantly turning him down. what is that doing to his self esteem? any advice will be appreciated.",
"what to expect from ed specialized therapy?. my boyfriend has been pushing recovery hard. we re canadian so most things medically related are free for us but not very good. my bf amp; i have good health insurance through his work and he said he s willing to pay the extra for a good recovery program. he recently found a privately funded psychotherapist who is specialized in eating disorders. i ll admit, their website is impressive with how serious they seem to commit themselves to their patients. i agreed to make an appointment, thinking i d be put on some super long wait list. my first appointment is next monday i m really nervous. like most people with eating disorders, i crave control and i don t know what to expect here which really has my brain working overtime. help, any insight on what to expect would be nice. thanks guys",

food quality during recovery?. i just began my recovery very recently 2 f . i am very active i do martial arts and weight training and for the past 6 months i have been significantly reducing my calories. before recovery i was eating 8 calories a day. i know recovery is about eating fear foods and just more in general but what am i supposed to eat? the last couple days i have let myself eat dessert and more carbs but i feel like i should be eating more nutrient dense food. what do you do?,
"how do i recover. hey. i'm really scared to post this but i just don't know what to do anymore ok where do i start.. i'm a 13 year old girl. this summer i kinda starved myself, eating first about 8 cals a day, then about 4 , and sometimes even less. i lost about 6 kg. now, school started, and i really wanted to recover, so now i think i'm eating about 1 12 ? maybe more, maybe less, i don't even know. probably less because i still lost 2 kg since school started.. but i'm scared to eat more because for example yesterday i ate more than usual and i'm pretty sure i gained half a kilogram. my metabolism is so bad right now and i get so bloated no matter how little i eat. i'm not even that underweight, i also have a big bone structure, i'm literally sedenary like the only movement i do is walking to school everyday, some days i don't move at all because my dad drives me. i lost my period and i haven't grown taller in months, also i'm 145 cm so i wouldn't like to be this short my whole life. i don't even know why i posted this, i just really need some advice. and i don't want to gain any weight because whenever i do my day is ruined and i'm not motived to do anything, and i'm angry at everyone, i also can't tell anyone about this and can't ask for help because i know my parents or doctor will make me gain weight. i don't even know why i posted this i just need some advice",
"ways to deter obsessive thought spirals about food and weight before they get bad?. i am looking for ways to calm my mind and move onto other thoughts when i notice i'm going to get into an obsessive thought spiral about food, weight and my recovery. right now i'm trying to repeat to myself ""you're going to look back on this as an amazing year, don't let it be overshadowed by your eating disorder"". i'm just maybe looking for cbt tactics to remind myself that my weight and obsessing over calories isn't important and that i could be much happier and healthier if i direct that energy into something else. what do you guys do tell yourselves in order to move on decrease the severity of or even just distract yourself from these thoughts?",
weighing more on your period?. have you experienced weighing more while you re on your period? how many pounds have you noticed your weight fluctuate during that time? i m probably just being overly paranoid and telling myself nobody gains this much on their period. but some reassurance some other people who have experienced the same emotions about this would be really nice.,
"struggling with reality. so yesterday i went with this person to this eating disorder hospital place because i was struggling and i really thought i was doing better bc i was eating 12 calories but when they weighed me i asked not to look and they told me later that i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa i was so shocked and it just didn't make sense to me and then they told me that i was ""significantly underweight"" bc my percentile was .91 and i just stood there in disbelief bc ... i'm not significantly underweight... i'm too fat to be underweight... and the weird twisted thing is obviously i didn't like to hear that but a small part of me was happy about that and i don't think i have a problem. however they then told me that my height to weight was 77.31 and that i couldn't go to school until it gets to 8 bc they're worried about the strain it might have on my heart. and i now have to eat 3 whole meals and 3 snacks for god knows when and i have to gain weight and i'm terrified and i know have no control over what i'm allowed to eat anymore and i feel so confused. i'm 14, in year ten and i'm preparing for my gcses and i'm a target grade 9 in everything except re in business where i'm a 8 and i had two tests today and a story i had to finish writing. and i just feel guilty for all the stress i'm putting my family and friends and boyfriend through. none of this feels real... i can't have anorexia... i'm not thin enough...i don't have a problem... i don't need to gain weigjtit doesn't make any sense whatsoever...",
clothes shopping triggers. i bought some jeans in my usual size and they are too small. i know that all companies make their clothes differently so the fit is different depending on the brand but even though i am aware of this it is still a huge trigger for me and i don t know how to deal with it. does anyone have advice ?,
"advice?. so i posted on an ed forum and nobody answered so... i was asking about advice based on my eating disorder and asking if before trying recovery again i should go ahead and have the binge food i was craving for the last three days. i ended up ordering it and thinking i could let this one roll off my back. now that i m waiting for the order i m getting anxiety and wondering if i just really fucked up. basically i restrict and binge eat, both separate eating disorders developed in different points in my life with different triggers. which is why the just dont restrict and you won t binge method seems to not work. but i need to get physiotherapy and my mom wants to help me make a meal plan tomorrow because i texted her crying and scared to go to work the next day because i binged and i am at my highest weight in years. fashion is a creative outlet for me but also a huge trigger there are tons of great pieces i want but am too fat and too broke to do so. my restriction has lately gotten so much more comfortable and the binges have gotten so much more addictive and i m a bit afraid of how my food is going to affect me emotionally after i ve eaten it. i had food delivered 3 times this week already, the delivery lady knows me by name and said hi to me where i work because she recognized me. i threw away most of one of my 73 dollar order and just ordered almost 5 dollars of food tonight. she doesnt seem to mind at all and i used to work in food service and relate.. we like reoccurring customers who aren t complete assholes to food service workers who typically order the same things. edit: they gave me regular soda not diet so i guess i ll give it to my mom because despite being able to inhale pasta i cant drink regular soda ever",
"recovery tips. i really want to get better and i just wondered if anyone has any tips or anything or ways to distract yourself. so i'm a 14f and for a couple years i've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that i was fat and i've always been trying things to lose weight because i was only in the 49 5 th percentile for my height ""5' "" i'm very small and even though i'm 14 i've basically stopped growing i tried things like i've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired i barely ate lunch at school in the past two three years and rarely i would make myself throw up. i ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but i usually just binged on toast by the time i got home anyway. i never really thought of it as a problem i guess bc i never lost anything i just thought of it that it was normal and the most i ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days. that was up until 4 months ago. so, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend i started to become determined that i would do something about the fact that i was fat because i simply had to lose weight. i don't think this had anything to do with my bf and i'm not entirely sure what triggered it. but i started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... and it worked although ocassionally i would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days i would eat normally. food became my obsession and it controlled my life i couldn't function properly and i was so... so hungry. i felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. but no matter what i wasn't rly skinny enough i mean i think at some point i made it to around the 1st percentile i don't know what i weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that but i wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me. my bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. and i also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. last thursday i finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad andyesterday i broke down and asked for help even though i've been eating lunch thanks to my bf help and he explained it to my mum... i think and i rly want to get better... for me... my bf... and so i can be finally happy.",
breakfast and lunch ideas. ok so i restricted so i was mostly eating one meal a day with a couple binges and a few days of eating more and now i'm kinda terrified of food and i'm trying to eat more healthily and i don't know how to eat normally anymore and i guess i need someone to tell me what to eat and how much exactly of it to eat and i guess i don't rly think i have an eating disorder because i was never sick or thin enough but i wondered if anyone has any ideas for breakfast or lunch or the amount of calories i should eat for those meals which would rly help because i'm struggling.,
motivation. i guess i rly need someone to tell me that i deserve to eat more than one meal a day,
"wanted to give some good news . this time last year i was in the grips of my ed and for a time believed it would be that way forever. i started uni and had a sudden loss of a close friend happen within a couple months. i was devastated and stressing out but i realized i needed to take care of myself. i have seen from my friend what not putting your body first and running from issues can do. since then i have been doing a lot better. the first few months were hard because i was gaining and didn t think i could ever feel full again i was just sooooo hungry . those fears are mostly gone now. i can feel full and do so after every meal. yes i ve gained but i ve learned to love my body because it allows me to succeed in what i want to do, i would be nothing without it so i give it love and food . i didn t keep gaining forever my body has just been chilling around a weight it likes more. my brain has been healing too. i feel more focused and motivated in my studies and almost all the irrational things i used to believe about food are gone. i just wanted to share some positivity and proof that recovery is possible, even in the direst if times.",

"first major relapse since inpatient 2 15 trigger warning . i'm not sure where this is going, but i'm scared. i'm 26 and have been struggling with anorexia with b p episodes for most of my life. it's related to trauma, which i am currently working on with an amazing therapist and support group, but my ed has come back with a vengeance the last few months after almost two years of being able to eat pretty normally and feeling ""recovered."" i was in inpatient treatment for the first time in 2 15 and even though the road was a little rocky for the my first year out, i really felt like i had a handle on things and basically had my ed urges on the back burner. i had a major trigger may 1 th and it's just been a slow descent since then. my weight has dropped significantly, i'm actively restricting again every day, and i had my first b p since 2 16 last week. i passed out at a concert with friends, which was humiliating, and i know i should take that as a sign that my body is telling me to cut this shit out, but all i could think was how ashamed i should be and how i'm no where near thin enough to have warranted that reaction or to receive any help. i've tried to review old treatment materials, read through old journals full of reframed statements when i tried to fight ed brain with healthy logic, but the voice and urges are just so strong right now. i've only told one friend that i'm truly relapsing, and he's supportive but poorly equipped to help. and really i just felt like i needed someone i could admit this shit to in the hopes that revealing what is going on might slow things down. instead, i feel like it's sped up my decline. now i feel like i have to ""follow thru"" or i'm just weak and whiny. i went into treatment with the goal of never having to go back. i worked hard, went to every group, took notes and tried to learn from my team and the recovering people around me. now that i feel like i'm in free fall, i feel like a failure, like i'll be a disappointment to my family, like i'm too old now to be going back to this horrible life and doing even more permanent damage this time. i don't want to destroy the life i've finally been able to build for myself, but it feels so strong right now. it's taken over and i know this leads to even darker place. i really just need some reassurance that relapse isn't the end? that i can still pull myself back out before it's too late.",

"anyone else find psychedelics to be beneficial in recovery?. tw: drug mention and ed stuff, as implied in title i've been recovering for the past 2 years or so but have found the disordered mindset quite difficult to shake off. discomfort over my weigh gain and fantasizing about being thin again took up a lot of headspace and i never felt recovered mentally. although not a solution in themselves, i've found that using shrooms has helped me look at my disordered thoughts more objectively and since tripping i've been able to ignore them more easily. i think that they showed me that i didn't need to remain stuck in this mindset and that it was a thought loop that actually could be broken out of. in some ways, it feels like they've reset my self image and allowed me to re evaluate my sense of self worth and create goals that aren't focused around trying to manipulate my body in a destructive way. i also think that it has helped me process feelings of discomfort more constructively in the 'afterglow' from my trip i felt amazing in my own skin, and had more positive feelings towards my body than i had ever expected to have. while i was aware that this would fluctuate and would not be permanent, i'm trying to hold on to the idea that good days like these are possible and actively work towards remembering how these days feel on the not so good days. has anyone else had similar experiences? what are your thoughts?",

"new podcast about the hard, stressful, overwhelming reality of ed recovery . hi everyone i just started a podcast today where i plan on sharing my experience with eating disorders, mental health, and general life drama. i decided to start it after a few weeks of shame filled and stressful binge eating that followed a year or so of intense calorie restriction. i felt there was a need for podcasts and other content that talk about eating disorder recovery from the perspective of someone going through it, rather than someone who has already recovered and is giving advice from the other side. i'm going to talk about the struggles i face, especially those of self shaming and anxiety, along the road to recovery and the road to feeling ""good"" hence the name, waiting for good. : please give it a listen here https: waitingforgood.podbean.com and let me know what you think if there are any topics you'd like me to discuss link again: https: waitingforgood.podbean.com https: waitingforgood.podbean.com ",

"what i have learned from seeing a registered dietician. there was a post on r askwomen https: www.reddit.com r askwomen about having a healthy relationship with food. seeing so many people struggling there, i felt compelled to write up what i have learned from seeing a dietician. i just realized it may be helpful here also eat at least 15g of protein within an hour of waking up. whether or not i do this is the biggest indicator of my mood, hunger cues, and eating habits the rest of the day. please try it. it has changed my life. amount is based on bmi the plate model for lunch and dinner: 1 2 plate vegetables, 1 4 plate carbs, 1 4 plate lean protein fish, chicken, beans, nuts, seitan, tempeh, tofu, wheat gluten, etc. meal planning: plan out your meals for the entire week on one day gets easier quicker after a few weeks and write a shopping list for only what you need. shop one day a week max two if you forget somethings and stick to your list. helps keep your grocery budget low and eliminates impulse purchases. your relationship with food and your body is the longest relationship you have. it is an ongoing process. that is okay. eat a snack in between lunch and dinner that contains a lean protein and a carb. 7 1 g protein beans protein and carbs; nuts protein and fats. fat you need healthy fats in your diet for important biological processes. nuts, fish, avocados, olive oil, dark chocolate, coconut coconut oil, small servings of cheese, etc. if you are faced with the option of high fat, low sugar vs low fat, high sugar choose the first one. try for consistent meal times each day, including weekends. roughly the same time this one is so hard eating balanced meals, eating a good amount, and eating consistently throughout the day helps way more than just how your body feels. it helps your mind, your mental health, and mood. i cannot say i have achieved perfection or anything close to it, but these steps have really helped me a lot. edit: please do not give yourself more food rules because of this post i wish i had put a trigger warning and now i feel terrible. these ideas are not right for everyone and not right for every stage of recovery it may also be good to note that i implemented these things one at a time over many months all at once would have been impossible.i posted this because i know some people do not have the privilege of seeing their own dietitian. i personally was not able to afford it until recently.",
they are taking away my scale. i am trying to process that the nutritionist and therapist have asked me to turn in my scale. i know this should be something that is dumb and i should be ok with letting it go. but i am trying to grasp my emotions and i just can't. i know the number does not define who i am. i know that in the end this will help with my recovery. but i feel that i am losing a part of me when i turn it in anyone else have had this happen to them or weigh themselves daily?,
started iop and it has not been easy. hello all i have been diagnosed with depression and binge eating disorder just recently. i am a 37 hispanic female who has probably had a problem since puberty but because of my culture and mental health something that is usually not talked about i never knew anything about it. i started iop last tuesday and it s been extremely overwhelming. i started a blog to write my day to day process in recovery but also as an outlet for me to express how i feel. even sometimes make fun of myself. hence my username. and i also excited that i found this place as well. certainly looking for another outlet and find some support from others going through the same thing. my blog www.donuttouchmymazapan.com ,

"feeling extremely warm after large meals during recovery?. i've been in recovery for several months now with slow but general progress . something that i'm finding is that often times after eating a large meal, i become like a furnace. my palms become red, by face feels warm, and if it's at the end of the day i'll wake up in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat. it usually lasts anywhere from 15 45 minutes, and sets in anywhere from 3 9 minutes after eating. has anyone else experienced this? since i've started recovery i've stopped being freezing cold constantly, but i still run a good deal colder than most, which is why it's so noticeable. for what it's worth, at my lowest i was floating at a bmi of around 17 and i'm currently at a bmi of 17.5 18 or so like i said, slow but general progress .

"can anyone tell me if this is normal, and when i can expect it to stop?. i'm a 19 year old female. this is my first post on here, but i've lurked for a few months. i've suffered from anorexia for about 2 years now. recently, i finally decided that enough was enough. i've been underweight for approximately a year, and severely underweight for about 6 months. for the past month and a half, i have upped my calorie intake greatly. before, i was quite restrictive and i've been told i was close to collapse. my question is... is the extreme constipation and gas i experience on a daily basis normal? at the risk of giving too much information, it's not uncommon for me to have a bowel movement every 3 days despite feeling painfully bloated and knowing that i'm putting a lot of food in my body. the gas....well it's unlike anything i've ever smelled. it literally smells like i've shit myself, and it occurs 1 times a day. this makes it really hard to continue eating when i feel so full, and as if my body cant process the food fast enough. is this normal? will it go away? when? any replies would be so appreciated as this is a huge setback for me, and quite frankly it's making my life hella awkward. by the way, this thread is amazing and has been the inspiration for me to start this journey. stay strong beautiful people. lt;3",
"tips for the holiday period posted to r edrecovery too . gently ease into the holiday season by focusing on activities that don't involve food, such as putting up decorations, or sending e cards. check in with your body before and while you are eating am i feeling hungry? am i feeling full? remember that all food is neutral there are no good or bad foods. if it makes you feel better, organize your own food to take to a function or a meal, and let the host know that you will be doing this, in advance. stay away from any kind of good food bad food diet thinking or conversation. if things don't go as planned, remember that one meal will not make a significant difference to your body. if you are hosting a meal, allow people to bring food that they feel ok eating, if they wish to. try to shift the focus away from food and counting calories, to celebrating, and spending time with loved ones. work out your own support system in advance identify close friends and or family members that you can reach out to for support, if and when you need it. or ask a friend if you can text her him to check in, if you feel you need to. plan some alternative activities that you can do when you are feeling stressed or over whelmed, e.g. taking the dog out for a walk, take a drive somewhere or call a friend. take care of yourself if this means not going to a function, or going to a function , then do what feels right for you at the time. surround yourself with people who have healthy relationships with their bodies, and who do not focus on food and weight. or when attending gatherings, bring a trusted family member or friend along with you, if you can. most of all, try and enjoy yourself, whatever you choose to do ",

"a question about subcultures. in the social circles that i travel anarchism, feminism, punk, other identity political groups there is the common belief that followers of these subcultures are immune to eating disorders. that because these folks are outside of society and are fully capable of seeing through societal advertising lies these subcultures are free from some of the pressures and root causes. however, i know feminists in recovery from an eating disorder and the feminism queer politics person as the case may be was ""in the know"" prior to recovery so this is clearly a lie. while eating disorders are intensely private and personal in their root causes, it seems to be in vogue to blame the media. these folks prove that if the media is taken out of the equation there can still be eating disorders. is it just me that's noticing this? this is more of a discussion topic than a direct question, i know. it's just something that i've been thinking about lately.
