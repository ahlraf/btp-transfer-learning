"i am very depressed because of this... so about 9 days ago i ate something and it made me feel really sick.. i have a phobia to throwing up i went to the hospital because of this and they did an endoscopic procedure and said everything looked fine. however i was admitted for inability to eat or drink. so my mind kind of screwed me up because i am no longer on any psyche meds and i ended up not being able to eat any food for about 4 days because of this, and on the 5th day i was able to slowly eat jell o italian ice, basically nutritional value. on the 6th day i drank a cranberry juice, and ate 2 fruit popsicles, and half a can of ginger ale, and i starting having very bad acid reflux. which i am now on 3 medications for. on the 7th day i introduced saltine crackers, and every time i eat i just feel sick, nauseous and kind of painful. the doctors at the hospital said i was anorexic, and severely malnourished. very underweight . i was released today after being in the hospital those 7 days and i ate a piece of toast, and 6 crackers, but i just feel sick every time i eat. it is making me very depressed because i don't wanna feel sick anymore, and when i eat i feel sick, and when i don't eat i feel sick because my body is starving itself. i guess my question is has anyone experienced something similar? and if so how long was it that you were able to eat without pain or nausea after going an extended period of time 5 7 days without solid food. will it ever go away? i feel as if it won't and i just eagerly searching for some reassurance that it will go away and sooner then i think if i continue eating at least some toast and crackers every day to try to train my body again to take food. if anyone could please share with me something similar and how it went or if you have some idea if this will go back to normal and how long after not being able to eat normal food. thank you.",

"3 years of severe an seeking treatment that was unavailable to those with asd combined. i went to organisations and anyone i could to beg for help, i welcomed it and received discrimination towards a diagnosis.. living with autism amp; anorexia https: livingwithautismanorexia.com everywhere i went; i was cornered and on the path to death. i never gave up, the rigidity they said asd brings stopping me from getting treatment in their eyes was what gave me the mentality of no shades of grey life or death. i chose life and i am here today to advocate that no matter the challenges, we won t be forgotten or removed from a treatment because of a diagnosis they feel makes it harder for them. it s not easy and still is not today, like many; i battle every day. i publish my work on a site who gave my a platform for my voice. i have gone to organisations who sent urgent letters for support to mps, ministry of health, and so many more places that unfortunately let me down. i didn t give up there, after 9 or so months i created my own platform for advocacy and where people can use their healthy voices to advocate or just tell their stories, share their art, use writing to help process their emotions or share their support companions for a break away from eds. to seperate yourself from that identity and form a healthier one and thrive. they gave up on me but i made sure i created a place where you won t be forgotten and you will feel heard. i welcome anyone with a healthy voice to share their story. there are rules; no hate speech, no numbers, i do not allow pro ana or any other form or pro ed content, this is a safe environment for recovery, no slandering and naming of people or places. because we can voice our needs without the negativity we were shown. that s how you make change. you can live the way you deserve, be loved and be heard. i did this at my worst and you can too. i do not exclude any form of ed or mental health. i truely wish everyone well. all submissions go through editing for safety and polishing, this will prevent any negative or pro behaviour. i also have dr june who i submit through her site to edit along side. living with autism amp; anorexia https: livingwithautismanorexia.com ",
"do i have an ed??. so this has been going on for over a year now, not my whole life. i basically go through these episodes of eating a lot, eating normally, and eating very little or nothing at all. i ve noticed these episodes can last months, weeks, days, or even hours. over a year ago, i suddenly lost my appetite one day and i started starving myself because of that. then when i started gaining my appetite back, i started coming up with reasons for myself to not eat, and i managed to convince myself that i didn t deserve food. i remember going back into my room after eating very small meals and straight up breaking down each time because i ate something. i would just feel this intense guilt, and i still feel that same guilt to this day whenever i eat. so after that i went on and off with my episodes. although back last may it has gotten a lot worse. and i didn t think much of it until i realized i couldn t fit in some of my pants anymore, they were too big when just months ago they fit like a glove. then in june this whole situation got even worse, i couldn t fit in any of my pants without wearing a belt, i started noticing my body becoming skinnier, i would either eat a meal a day or nothing at all, and even then i don t know if i d count those as meals since they were such small amounts. i ve slightly recovered since then, i ve gained most of my weight back but now i ve felt so overweight and fat even though i m on the brink of being underweight. my body image used to be really good just months ago, and now whenever i look at myself in the mirror i cringe and tell myself that i look fat, i m almost never hungry. so now i find myself skipping meals and just overall trying to avoid food cause i want to loose weight even though i know i shouldn t cause what i m doing is extremely unhealthy, but it s so difficult. cause now whenever i eat i m only doing it for the physical energy, and half of the time it takes me about an hour to even eat a small meal. i throw away a lot of my meals because i can t bring myself to finish them, i just feel extremely full once i sit down with my food and it s like this voice in my head telling me to stop eating don t eat that don t eat until you re overweight you get the point. so basically i m asking if anyone thinks this could be a possible ed. and if so what should i do? nobody in my personal life knows about this, although i m sure a couple of them suspect something is up since some of my family has expressed concern about how little i ve been eating, but also i can just kinda feel a few of my friends and family s eyes on me whenever i eat really slowly or very small amounts.",
"best ed recovery tips? i gotchu. 1. impersonalize yourself as you would to another human being. instead of telling yourself things like ""bruh why cant i just do it"" ""im so stupid"" ""i hate that i keep relapsing im a failure"" imagine yourself to be your bff and now would you tell them the same as ""bruh why cant you just do it?"" ""youre so stupid"" ""i hate that you keep relapsing you failure"" or even better if its the 5 year old version of you 2. be kind and self love is key 3. remember that relapse is normal and everyone goes through it u just have to get right back up 4. if youre scared youll eat too much or binge when youre already full but still keep on eating try intuitive eating it really helped me on my recovery 5. allow all food remember that that restrictive voice will only try to make you not eat you have to go against it so next time when it says ""omg thats too high in cals"" tell that voice to shut up and ""im exactly gonna eat this bc wow it looks fancy omg yasss ima queen king"" fun fact you are 6. remove stress by meditating, do your fav hobby activity which could be dancing, gardening,art writing, reading wattpadetc cuddling to ur partner or a teddy bear, wearing makeup, kissing yoursel ok maybe not the last one hah 7. tell the food rules and that ugly police that it can kiss its own barbie dolls ahole and that youre not listening to it trust me when i was in ed recovery i thought i was weak af but once i got that feeling of challenge even your ego wont quit even if u decide to ty for reading them and omg ur already on it you goo adorable human looking at my text rn from behind the screen hey i see that smile you got and ah wow i sense some positivity yay",
"dealing with weight gain. so i ve been struggling with body image and food for about 6 years, since i was 13. back then i was reallyy skinny, but since then ive gained a lot of weight. and i know i shouldnt look like i did then, i was a bit underweight anorexic, and the weight i have now is average normal and healthy. but i cant shake this feeling that i would be prettier if i lost some weight, maybe, my boyfriend would even love me more, or be more attracted to me if i lost a bit of weight. he hasn t shown any signs of not being attracted to me, nor that he doesnt love me. in fact he tells me he loves me etc all the time. but his ex was reallyy skinny, like almost ed skinny and i m not overweight but i have curves, which he tells me he loves but idk. seeing all these skinny girls on tiktok without any fat on their bodies getting praised does something to me. i dont want to be a constellation price, but some part of my brain tells me that i will always be one unless i become one of those beautiful girls. at the same time i know that it would be bad if i tried to lose weight again, cause every time ive done that, i ve never gotten satisfied with my life, body and especially i always develop a very unhealthy relationship with food. so yeah, idk what to do.",

"empathic trauma?. i'm a binge eater but managed to lose weight and got to a healthy weight for my height. but i went up the past 2yrs and couldn't figure out why i would have done that to myself after working so hard to get healthy. a moment ago i figured out why. without getting into too much information because it regards a minor, my daughter was sa by a family friend and was arrested, 3 days later he posted his 1 k bail and was free as of today the court charged him finally and he is on the list . according to my weightloss app and it's stored data, my weight gain began the very next day after he was arrested and i steadily gained every month. i am no longer at an unhealthy weight, managed to get down to something manageable so far and still working on losing more. i guess my question is, do you think i absorbed the trauma by being a victim's mother? my daughter is 1 mentally healthy and has a therapist helping when she needs it but overall she is weirdly fine. i'm the one that ended up with the trauma and not her, and i ended up binge eating after it. has this happened to anyone else?",

"not sure if i m struggling from en eating disorder or how to fix this.. i don t know if i have an eating disorder but it feels like it. i relate heavily to most symptoms of arfid. it all started when i was little that most food just became so unappealing, especially food i used to like. my parents divorced around that time. for years i ve been so skinny. i hate looking at my stupid skinny arms. i hate that i can t even wear most bracelets because of how skinny my arms are. i hate that people are scared to touch my arm in fear of breaking it. i hate that i feel jealous of people who look healthier. i try to want to eat food, but i don t like anything. most stuff i ll eat is the unhealthy garbage from fast food restaurants, and i can t eat that every day. i feel like crying because i m so hungry, all the time. school is hell because i have even less opportunities to force myself to eat something. the only stuff i bring is a granola bar and some small candy. that isn t enough. it s never enough. eating for me is the worst. i can t understand how people can say they love food. i look and feel awful. i don t know what to do. i don t know how to make this feeling go away. i m scared i ll never love food again and i ll be stuck like this forever. i m wondering if i have an eating disorder so i can figure out how to treat it, i don t know what to do anymore. sorry if this is an unorganized mess, i just feel like crap.",

"i hate the process of eating?. i'm not sure how else to word this, and i'm having a hard time finding any advice or anything about this online. i've struggled with anorexia off and on in the past, and am extremely picky to the point where i've considered bringing up the possibility of arfid at the doctor, but this is unrelated to that. i'm not sure if this is perhaps more related to my adhd but i'm just hoping to gain some insight. my issue is that i range from disinterested to very unhappy with the process of eating. like even if i crave something and am hungry, i wish i could just taste it and teleport the food onto me. the process of biting, holding, chewing, and swallowing food makes me really unhappy. it gets to a point where i'm so tired of the action of eating that even if i am still hungry or am really enjoying my food, i will stop eating because i'm just so tired of doing it. it also sometimes is so unpleasant for me to physically eat that it makes me nauseous. it sucks because i am still definitely actively restricting calories often, so when i do feel mentally well enough that i'm willing to eat properly, this gets in the way of that. when i'm struggling with this, it really is simply about boredom anxiety of how long its taking or how much effort i have to put onto chewing and swallowing and everything, not about how the food will affect my body or anything. any insight on where to go from here or if this is something i should speak to a medical professional about and a better way to phrase it would be very appreciated ",

"what does this mean. so i ve struggled with eating disorders for about 5 years now and i would really like to know what this means and what i can do to change. my ed story actually began with me being a very dedicated athlete and feeling little to no hunger which led to me getting injured constantly. i never knew this was an eating disorder until about a year later when i noticed signs of restriction and weight watching. during this time though, i was never a calorie counter or a number watcher, i just couldn t eat. during quarantine i fell back in love with food and began cooking for my family every night as well as enjoying the meals then flash forward to about a year ago from now, i started to obsess with the numbers. in a couple weeks i lost a number of pounds and woke up to not being able to feel my hands or feet. i was already underweight so losing that much took a toll on my body. i knew i had to change something so i began to self recover. i felt like i had recovered to a very healthy point so i stopped focusing on it, now though, i am at an even lower weight than i was at my rock bottom and i just can t eat. i don t want to lose weight or anything, i just want to be healthy. i feel hungry but whenever the food is infront of me i get nauseous and can t eat it. i m scared of letting this get too far, and i m worried about my body. my family doesn t understand this and it s very hard to get help when those who can help you don t understand or listen. i m not sure what to do, i appreciate all advice. sending love",
"relapsing. hello all. i am new posting here. here is a background of my ed. in high school i developed and eating disorder. my family always made comments about me being thin since i was a child. my nana would call me a little colt, my parents would always talk to others about how i was itty bitty and how i stayed in small sized clothing for such a long time between ages 7 9. as a young teen my friends always said how jealous they were of my thin body and so did my family. i was discouraged from saying how i felt fat because all my family members and boyfriend were bigger than me and it hurt their feeling and made them feel fat. i wasn t allowed to diet when my whole family was allowed. i was very controlled in a strict religious household as a child and i resorted to controlling the only thing that i felt i could, and that was what i ate and my weight appearance. fast forward. i am going through an incredible amount of stress right now. i don t even want to write about it because it s too much. i feel like my whole life is out of control right now. i am feeling the need to control my food coming back. i am obsessing over losing the weight that i put on this year. i m nervous but i m also getting so many feel good hormones from controlling my food intake, exercising, and seeing some changes in my body. i just need to talk to others who understand because i know i m not going to be able to stop this.",
"i know i m undiagnosed but i feel constantly invalidated and it reaaaaally hurts. i 18f have been struggling with my body image and eating for around a year now, but it got a lot more severe and restrictive in the last 6 months and i m now dealing with a lot of side effects of weight loss and under eating. after a long struggle trying to get treatment in the nhs i was told that my bmi isn t low enough to meet the criteria for the ed clinic but that my local services literally did not have the facilities to try to help with potential eating disorders. i was sent to the doctors to get blood tests to see if i had any nutrient deficiencies came back that i did and also to get weighed, they took the bloods but didn t weigh me. my dad is lovely but completely clueless as to the extent of my problems and keeps making incredibly invalidating and demeaning comments which i know he doesn t mean anything by but they really hurt eg: when i first told him i thought i may have an ed he said but you eat loads . i know that i m not diagnosed with anything but i don t really know what to do because it feels like not a lot of people are taking me seriously and like i m constantly just slipping through the cracks but nothing i m doing is helping. i feel like it s just pushing me to get worse to kind of say look i told you, which i m scared of, but i also don t feel like i can choose recovery because i don t feel ill enough because if no one around me and the professionals aren t worried, then i can t be bad enough to need recovery. i m just kind of at a stand still and have no idea what to do because i know i don t want to get hospitalised but i m terrified of getting help and having to gain weight. i just feel constantly invalidated by so many factors and it s so hard to want to get better when constantly being told that essentially i m not that bad.",

"does my dad have an eating disorder?. i moved in with my dad a few weeks ago. beforehand he did have moments where he would eat a lot, especially when binging something. but i thought it was just mindlessly eating and since it wasnt that big of an issue at the time i ignored it. but im starting to notice him binge eat a lot. its gotten bad enough for me to point it out. it has been worrying me lately so ive done some research, though im hoping i can get better answers here. here are some symptoms he has: he eats even when hes full, eats more than planned, he hides his food from us, will snack when hes bored, eat large amounts while binging something, and avoids the issue. this has gotten worse ever since hes quit smoking. he has had a couple addictions in the past and i dont want this to be another one of them. im sorry if calling an eating disorder an addiction is wrong, please correct me if thats true. i dont know much about eating disorders but i have a feeling this will escalate if i dont spot it out first. does this sound like an eating disorder or is he just overeating? how can i help him? and if you do know, are there any numbers to call to ask these questions? thanks.",

"did i used to have an ed?. hi i m just thinking about my past eating habits and i m confused. when i was around fifteen sixteen i had severe constipation so i started using laxatives and eating greens. after that i guess i started abusing?. i was obsessed with the feeling of an empty stomach. i would eat greens always, avoid meat except for seafood and sugary foods. i would always eat the same meal cooked spinach and chicken for so long or some sort of prawn meal weight gain was always something on my mind. i was definitely obsessed. if i had a fatty meal i would detox until i thought i was skinny enough. i remember punching so many belt holes but thinking it was not enough. i definitely had body dysmorphia because i always thought i was gaining weight while everyone told me i looked thin. i remember once it was my friends birthday and that s when i ate properly. and i could not stop eating, i just couldn t feel full. would this be binge eating? the thing that confuses me though is when i realised what i was doing, i just snapped out of it. i read back on my journal entries and i noticed how i was obsessing over food or was always scared of weight gain. i gradually started eating normally and gained weight healthily. so what was actually going on?? i m twenty now, and i eat whatever i want most of the time. i still do feel guilty when i eat sometimes but it s rare , and i wouldn t have certain meals such as pancakes for breakfast or cans but i m definitely nowhere near as bad as i used to be.",

"recovering from ed but fear bf is at risk at getting an ed. quick history: i had a restrictive ed, currently trying to recover, still struggling with binging and having a healthy food intake. still has a lot of food fears, incredibly picky regardless and lots of food anxiety this is important. i recently admited to my bf about my food anxiety. he doesn't know im recovering or that ive ever had an ed. i explained how chosing what to eat gives me loads of anxiety as my parents have always made given me food and ive never had choice, not telling about how the only time i did have choice and control was during my ed so chosing food during recovery stresses me out . this was in context to eating out on dates and stuff, and how id prefer if he just chose the place and ill happily go along and it would be better all around. he's always had body image issues, even though he is quite skinny and definitvely not fat or anything, even though he thinks he is. i don't care about what he looks like in the regard he is insecure about, and i do find him attractive anyways and ever since i started dating him ive known of his insecurity from sending like, shirtless mirror pics and from when he takes his shirt off. i always comfort him and say all the things to make him feel better etc, all while thinking how hypocritical i am as im tetering on the edge of my ed . i want to tell him about my ed and everything, especially as im attempting recovering etc but i don't want to like, trigger anything or incite anything in him, as he seems to be very vunerable to such an introduction to a sensitive topic. i wouldn't wish an ed on my worst enemy and especially not my bf and i don't want him struggling with food. my disordered mind watches what he eats just out of curiousity, and also in recovery a technic i use is i try to match what others eat so i know im eating enough etc and he doesn't eat disordedly i was worried for a moment he had an ed bc of the body insecurities but i forget not everyone is disorded and has that mentality and i have that assurance he still has a healthy relationship with food but just isn't happy with his body. this all just comes to me not being able to share this part of myself with anyone, bc none of my friends or family know and he would be the first. i am willing to do this on my own, and to help him love his body. if anything, it might help with recovery as i am trying to convince him to like his body, etc. but i dont know.",

"no. it s not a choice.. no. it s not a choice. have you ever walked barefoot on the wet grass, in the early hours of a morning, to an apple tree upon which the fruit hangs low and sways heavy with juice, dew dappled, like sequins of a little girl s bow? and then, have you reached up, as easy as one, two, three you tugged it off the branch, the droplets slid down your fingertips, down your elbow, your teeth snapped the skin with a loud crunch. for an interval you simply stood there, relishing the burst of juice that filled your mouth. i have. our apples come out late summer, early fall, when the incessant susurration of cicadas that always herald summer heat, dissipates, and the air is then held by the gentle trilling of crickets, and the occasional screeching of blue jays instead. our arkansas black are tart, sweet and tangy. their flavor is sharp, with nodes of vanilla and cinnamon. they are small, swarthy, with flushes of yellow on the sun shy bits. there is nothing like the freshly picked apples in the early morning of a day. my life is that apple. it has everything one should want: sweetness, crispiness, tang, crunch, spice, sourness, with cherry notes on top. there are endless possibilities, and the whole world is laid out before me, for my picking. but most importantly, i have freedom. i have the freedom, to choose. i could just reach out, and as easy as one, two, three i could pluck that apple off of the tree. i could have it all, should i choose. so why? why am i not making the choice to choose it? why am i not choosing life? why am i choosing death instead? why am i not choosing to feed my body, why am i choosing to feed the hunger instead? it is so easy, just swallow that apple. swallow it, damn it why can t i simply let it go? one day, feeling largely discouraged, ron reached out to one of the therapists we were working with, sharing his frustration with her. it is her body, her life, her decisions. she told him. but that is, quite literally, an insult to anorexia. and it s dumbing it down to the highest degree. because no. it s not a choice. no one chooses anorexia. not conscientiously. no one chooses the hurt. the deprivation. the torment. the despair. no one chooses to cut, to purge, to starve, to break yourself anew every day. it s not a diet you can simply turn on and off anytime you ever so wish. it s not an act of attention seeking. it s not a pastime hobby. and you don t do it just for the heck of it. you don t choose to lay in bed for hours, with hunger pangs so bad that they twist your stomach into knots. you don t choose to chew your food and never have it. that proverbial cash register sound dings in my head, every time any food item finds its way into my mouth: 1 medium sized strawberry cha ching x calories 6 blueberries cha ching x calories 3 almonds cha ching x calories 1 oz chicken cha ching x calories the bill adds up very quickly for a serial anorexic s daily intake. stay in control. the echo blares as loud as a bugle sounding reveille in the early a.m. it buzzes deafeningly in my ears like a blood feeding insect: bzzz weight weight weight weight weight weight weight weight gain you lost control, you big fat loser you bzzz chaos starts with this one bite, and then, like dominos, you ll see, a panoply of perfectly awful results will ensue. one, after, another. this strawberry tastes like heaven. i am chewing it carefully, slowly, methodically, with intention. and the smell, oh, the smell. my mouth engorges with the juice, a rush of saliva. i know i already had my allotment for the day, but god, i want to have it too. perhaps just this once. perhaps just this time spit it spit it out you fool i apologize for screaming, but you know, that s how i roll. and the rules must obeyed, for this is how you stay in control. you have a choice, you idiot, right here, right now, let yourself slip once, and it s down hill from there my friend, like the gemini viii tumbling end over end . there is always a moment, a fragment of a space, that gray area that swings between possibilities, the moment when opposing voices swirl in your head, coalescing to a blur like the ochre yellows and blues of starry night; it s the moment wherein lies the choice. you can choose to spit out the food, or you can choose to ignore the echoes in your head, and nourish your body. i have been so malnourished, for so long, that my body literally does t know how to eat naturally anymore. it actually requires a conscious decision and effort to do so. i am fighting it every waking moment. i think, it s like attempting to overcome a drug addiction. because you can t stop. you want to want to stop, but you are so severely constrained, restrained, chained to the spot by the echoes of this addiction that is anorexia, that making the right choice is virtually impossible. when you are in the bottom of that chasm, bridging the gap to wanting recovery, is like leaping over the san andreas fault. it s like jumping across continents. wanting to want to make the right choice, is the difference between galaxies. the truth of it is, that it is a dilemma everyone encounters, at some point in their lives, to the lesser or greater extent. maybe its deciding to break some insalubrious habits; perhaps it s biting your nails or skimping on sleep, or a couch potato turning gym rat cue in new years resolutions , to something more detrimental such as overcoming a severe, lifelong addiction. but really, what it boils down to is the inability to make a different choice. more precisely, the incapability of wanting to make the right decision. although, deep inside, we know what we ought to do. so no. it s not a choice. not at the moment, anyway. but i hope, that one day, in the early hours of a morning, walking the damp sward and with the fringes of my pants sopping wet, i will finally be able to reach up, as easy as one, two, three and pick that sour sweet apple from my arkansas black tree. crunch. https: medium.com nefritelor no its not a choice 17d23537 dd1 https: medium.com nefritelor no its not a choice 17d23537 dd1 ",

"bulimia question. does anyone else get offended when your siblings eat a lot of food that your parent made? is it cause you're ashamed you wasted your parents hard work and by binging on the food and then purging it which lowered the quantity from the over all amount and left less for everyone? but you see the other sibling just not care of the lower amount and just keep eating? is it guilt that cause of you, your parent will have to make more food again? is it cause you think it's unfair that they can eat so freely and you can't cause you will purge? i love my parents cooking and i hate myself for this is it cause you're angry at yourself that you want your siblings to eat less as well? or maybe because they don't help in the process that you want them to not get the same amount? maybe it's cause they always eat the food with meat in it and not the vegetables which pisses you off because then only the vegetables are left and it's unfair to your parent who then says no to the meat because she sees how less it is by the way, it's an older sibling i'm not abusing a younger one ... why did i have to clarify myself?",
hair loss. i lost a lot of hair due to malnutrition. my bmi is currently in lower end of normal weight but still normal weight. i never lost my period or was never that severely underweight anyway. i've been eating really well but i don't seem to gain anymore weight i've always been pretty skinny naturally . do you think i need to gain even more weight for my hair to grow or is a healthy bmi okay? of course i could eat a lot more and gain weight but at this point i'd rather eat intuitevely already and if i end up gaining more weight then fine but if this is it then so be it. all i really care about is getting my hair back so i just want to know how much weight has to do with it rather than eating enough and lots of fats and protein.,

"i just can t bring myself to eat without spiralling beforehand. throwaway for obvious reasons. i apologise in advance cause this is gonna be more of a word vomit thing cause i feel absolutely lost on how to handle it. i ve had issues with not eating before due to weight insecurities, but over the past year, i d been consistently binging. i gained a lot of weight and it started wrecking my self confidence. up until about a month ago. something irrelevant to discuss here triggered me to completely stop eating. this lasted 3 days until i had a wake up moment where i saw myself slipping back into my past habits. i forced myself to eat and after a few times of eating and puking, i was back to normal . instead, i decided to hit up the gym. i did so consistently every single day, but somewhere along the way, i didn t realise i d kept my eating to a minimum throughout. i did not have any desire to eat and the few rare times i did eat, it was something rarely considered a meal though in my mind, i fully considered it so like protein bars, fruits, etc. this is only further fuelled by seeing a difference in my body. i reached my goal weight today and i m still dissatisfied. i wanna go lower and this just stops me from eating. and it s not like i m forcing myself not to eat .i just don t want to. i don t feel like it. i know the rate of loss i m going at is scary and this is why im posting this here. i just have no idea what to do. i ve been to therapists haven t helped. started meds recently too soon for any substantial difference. i m just lost. i have no idea what to do. i want to change but part of me is terrified to gain the weight back.",

"my boyfriend triggers me, and i don't know what to do.. my boyfriend triggers me, and i don't know what to do. amp; x2 b; my bf and i met in college and have been dating since may. we lived separately when we started dating, i was in catered accommodation, he had his own place with a friend. he's pretty skinny, which is something i'm kind of insecure about. he doesn't know this is something that makes me feel guilty, as it's not an issue definitely not his issue , and is not something i want him aware of, or knowing him, feeling bad about. it is simply something i'm working on regarding my own perception of myself. i've never dated a guy who has thinner thighs than me. i know this sounds dumb, but sometimes when we're sat beside each other, and i look down, it makes me feel super insecure. anyway, thats not the problem. past my own insecurities about my own body, i really think that everyone else's are beautiful. my issue is that i used to have an ed. nothing super severe. i don't even know if my issues would be considered an ed. my cousin is the only one i've spoken to about it, and suggested i had one. i still don't feel super comfortable calling it that, and wouldn't generally. i just didn't know how else to refer to it, or where else to ask. it's been something that started most prominently during my teenage years, and got especially bad during covid. i always felt proud of myself when skipping meals, or going extended periods of time without eating. i would exercise extensively for days, then get burnt out and stop. recently, i've been making steps to overcome this. it gets bad sometimes, especially when i'm not occupied with things like classes, but generally i've been getting better. i've been actively forcing myself to not feel guilty about eating. i've actively been making myself eat three meals a day. i still get some serious guilt surrounding snacking, even when i'm hungry, but like i said, i'm working on it. my friends all eat very healthily, and they are who i had most of my meals with in college. it was actually kind of easy, especially in the dining hall, as portion sizes were given to us rather than serving yourself , and there were set meal times throughout the day. the issue comes with my boyfriends attitude towards food. he barely eats. this was something i kind of noticed when we first started dating. he has nothing against eating apparently , but thinks as hunger as nothing but a mental thing that you can ignore, and food as barely maintenance. sometimes he would offhand mention that he hadn't had breakfast or lunch that day, and i would ask ""are you not hungry?"" and he'd just shrug and say stuff like ""nah, i can just ignore hunger"". i'd urge him to eat healthier, and make him promise to have dinner when he got back to his place, but feel guilty for the rest of the day. i'd often skip meals after we spoke about it, despite myself knowing better. i know that his eating habits should not influence mine, but i hear him say that and i think somehow, like it's some kind of competition. like, he hasn't eaten anything all day, but i've had two meals, so better skip dinner to compensate. if he can do it why can't i? i would get super upset by his ability to just ignore hunger, because i couldn't. it was something i wanted desperately to be able to do. i would try everything, but just couldn't. but he can. he doesn't even seem phased. why couldn't i do that? also, i've tried to mention it a few times, subtly, to see if he was struggling somehow, and i might be able to help, but he assured me he has no issue with eating. he just finds it boring and wishes he didn't have to do it. he says sometimes he'll just eat loads in one go at breakfast so he doesn't have to eat for the rest of the day. he says it's inconvenient to have to stop what he's doing to eat if he gets hungry, so he doesn't. he doesn't get any enjoyment from it either. he says his attitude towards most flavours are neutral, or negative. there's no particular meal that he's fond of. i think the bigger incident for me came a couple months after we got together, and i went to his place for the weekend once classes ended. it was saturday, and we decided to go do some tourist y stuff. whilst we were out, it got a little past lunch time and i mentioned grabbing lunch. he seemed unfazed by this, and we went to fast food place since it was close by. he was talking enthusiastically to me the whole time, but barely touched his food. he ended up finishing like half, then looked down and said ""oh you're done? we can head back out if you want"", i asked if he was hungry and he basically said ""nah, i'd rather go back out than waste time eating"", then we left. later that night, we went to his place and watched a movie. i didn't have it in me to mention getting snacks. it was past the time i'd normally eat dinner. it was already dark, and i'd only had lunch that day. i was getting really hungry, but i just couldn't bring it in me to mention food. the guilt was too strong. about 2 hours later, once the movie was over and we were just talking, i had to mention it, motivated now more by the fact that i didn't want my stomach making noises. i still feel guilty about giving in and saying something. he didn't have any food in the house, which made sense because he'd been visiting his parents for like a week and a half before this, and his roommate had gone home for the summer. so i suggested we ordered something. he seemed reluctant. or maybe i was paranoid. he said he wasn't really hungry, so i can just order what i wanted. i couldn't. it just had to feel mutual, otherwise i don't think i could fight off the guilt. after a while, we ordered something for us both. two separate meals. neither of us finished them. the next morning we woke up and just hung out for a bit, chatted, watched some youtube, etc. he never mentioned breakfast. we were set to go out around 2 3pm ish and meet some mutual friends. i was starting to get really hungry. even as i got ready to go out, i didn't have it in me to mention lunch. i snuck a few fries from yesterday's leftovers to ensure my stomach wasn't making noises when we went out, and still felt bad. i went back to my own place after we met our friends, even though i was meant to spend another night with him. we hung out a few more times before i went home for the summer. i was distant for a while. i didn't mean to be, but i just was. now, i have a lot of anxiety surrounding going back next semester, and one of the issues i keep thinking about is the guilt i feel eating around him. it's not his fault, i know that, it's my own issues that are getting in the way, but knowing that doesn't make it any easier. i've had a kinda bad summer with it, counting calories and stuff, but nothing too bad. i'm just worried that being back there will make me bad again. i won't have a dining hall either this year. i'm cooking for myself. i know there's not really a clear question that i'm asking here, i just don't know what to do. i really like him, a lot, and he's not doing anything wrong. i'm the problem. i need to be stronger. but it's just so hard. surely, what's he's doing isn't healthy either? but when he explains himself so confidently, i can't help feeling like i'm failing somehow, and i'm weak for not being able to do the same. amp; x2 b; if this isn't the right place for this kind of post, just let me know. i've never used reddit before, and didn't know who else to ask about this. amp; x2 b; amp; x2 b; some side information: i haven't really spoken to anyone about my relationship, besides a cousin of mine who i'm pretty close with and has similar struggles. but this never went beyond guilty confessions and an agreement that it was unhealthy. family and friends are aware of how little i eat and i think my sister knows i have some guilt surrounding eating, but i've never mentioned this specific issue to anyone. also, my ex often hinted at me being fat. i'm average weight for my height, i know this logically, but a lot of his influence still impacts my mental process. i won't mention specific quotes, since i don't really want anyone finding this, but they're hard to describe. all subtle and yet super obvious comments on my size, especially how clothes looked on me.",
"any tips on how to stop body checking?. i ve been in recovery for a year now but shit is still hard. i keep body checking, may it be with my hands or looking in the mirror. i can t stop, sometimes i do it without noticing. it ruins my mood, for example: i was feeling ready to go to the gym today and eat my breakfast but i spent a good amount of time body checking and now i feel like i m getting bigger by the second and that i don t want to feel how my workout wear is sitting on my waist and that i do not want to go to the gym bc of it. i feel like i can t escape my stomach. i try hard to not do it but it s so fucking hardddddd. i also have this habit when i do this where i look in the mirror and i m like wow maybe i am getting more toned from my workouts, so i get so excited i look at myself from all angles so many times only to end up feeling like shit bc it looks like i keep getting bigger with every look and touch also this makes me question if i really am in recovery bc i ve gotten so much better with intuitive eating and my binge eating has stopped but still i do this and i get excited seeing results . i also question myself if it s bad for me to actually want to gain muscles and get toned i m going out of my mind, i just want to be at peace working out and eating and feeling good in my body.",
i think i may have a binge eating disorder?. when i was younger i was a bit chubby but started slimming out when i hit 13. ive always eaten a good amount maybe a extra snack than the average person but nothing close to binging. i ate like this and continued to maintain a healthy weight. for the past couple of months though i ve been wanting to lose even more weight in order to get a slimmer waist. i did this by skipping meals and eventually eating in calorie deficit. when i eat like this i get strong cravings for more unhealthy foods because i always try to eat cleaner food when eating in deficit. but due to this i get really strong cravings and end up over eating. then i feel guilty and skip a couple meals and the cycle continues. is this a ed?,
"restrict so much that i'm hungry but can barely eat more than a few bites?. i'm curious as to why this is. sometimes i have these more severe episodes in which i restrict for days to a few weeks. i find this happens when i'm really stressed or anxious about something too. and throughout the day sometimes i get the feeling that i'm starving. but i can't take more than a few bites out of anything without feeling sick or getting full right away. and so i'm walking around places feeling this horrible pit in my stomach. it's an odd feeling i can't explain, and i haven't had one in a bit so i'm having trouble remembering. it gets hard to function and try to go back into a somewhat normal state. i've been regularly hungry before but this feeling is something else. it's like i don't even feel half there. it's so odd. i'm trying to figure out what this is or if theres terms for it. i want to know why this happens, and if anyone else experiences it too?",
"i think i m developing an eating disorder and i don t know how to stop.. i ve always been overweight. my own father told me to starve myself when i was in high school because nobody would love me if i was fat. it s been over 1 years since that day, and it always stuck with me. but never to the point i listened to him. and then about a week ago i got food poisoning. i lost a significant amount of weight in 2 days. sure, i felt like shit. but i was happy to see a lighter number on the scale. since then i ve been eating less than the amount of calories i m supposed to eat in a day to keep it down, i lost more pounds this last week because of it. i know it s bad. i know i could get sick, or pass out if i push too hard. but i don t know how to stop. i m getting compliments about it, and i feel more confident. i genuinely don t want to stop because i know that it s working. but at the same time, i m scared. im scared my family will find out, im scared once i reach the point i ve lost a lot of weight the compliments will make me sad because of how it was done. most of all im scared that my dad was right. where do i go from here? edited to remove numbers of weight and my specific calorie intake.",

"don't know what to do. i have been struggling with my relationship with food for 5 6 years now ever since i had anorexia. i went through phases of restricting, binging, overexercising, purging, chewing amp; spitting, etc... i'm at a normal weight for my age and height right now. i want to lose a little bit of excess weight and try to maintain a balanced sustainable lifestyle, but i keep on relapsing into bad habits. i would download calorie counting apps because it seems like the only thing that worked for me when losing weight. however, i became too obsessed with it to the point that i memorize the calories of ingredients and my meals without tracking them. so, it's really hard for me to eat intuitively when all i could think about is if i'm eating too many calories to the point i'll gain weight. even when there's food with no nutrition facts, i still guesstimate or have the urge to search for the average amount of calories it has. now, if i don't track calories, i start losing control and overeating. it doesn't help that when my parents buy take out, i have the mindset of binging and starting over the following day. when there's ""unhealthy"" food at home, i have the urge to eat it all so it's out of my sight. i've also started going to the gym, but i feel so overwhelmed with trying to make everything a ""healthy"" lifestyle. learning to eat mindfully and going to the gym at the same time stresses me and my body out. i've tried downloading intuitive eating apps and considered getting a dietician nutritionist, but i feel like i already know what i have to do. however, i think i just lack the support system environment and need guidance. i'm honestly just venting at this point, but if anyone has had a similar experience, how did you get through it?",

"so tired and confused by this advice please. 21f so i ve been dealing with this for the past year. i am not really sure what s going on besides when i get stressed i completely stop eating. this used to be a trend in high school, but never this severe. last august i had been waking up everyday feeling sick and nauseous and would throw up everything i put in my body from the day before. i wasn t trying to throw up but it felt like when i would wake up it was an almost immediate reaction, unless i slept in way past the morning. this caused me to dramatically lose a lot weight to. i was unhappy about my weight at the time, but now i am scared i ve lost too much. it feels so cyclical and unavoidable. i haven t thrown up like that since last october which is an improvement but actually putting food in my body is such a struggle. i feel absolutely ill sometimes when i consume food lightheaded, sweaty, nauseous, and like almost immediate heart burn and burping. i m at work right now, i ve been unable to eat a full meal for the past 4 days and my anxiety has been haywire. i feel like absolute shit and i am scared. does anyone have advice for re introducing food to your body or how to get through this? i have a therapist and i ve been trying to it but i ve never asked people who have dealt with it first hand",

"losing sanity. i've been in recovery for about half a year now and the whole time i've been feeling like i'll make it to post recovery but these last couple of days have been super stressful for me mentally. my parents have started to become concerned, almost randomly, about my weight and diet. this new stimulus has been extremely difficult for me to take in for some reason or the other; maybe i just don't like people i don't trust to try to control my diet? the funny part is my dad weighted me and admitted i was at a ""healthy"" weight but continues to inquire about my eating habits every time we interact. it's becoming extremely emotionally and mentally debilitating. i've been losing sleep over the possibility of falling into old habits especially because i've voiced my concerns over the behavior and how it affects me yet it's still not taken seriously. i really don't know where to go from here. i feel as if i'm at a crossroad with my sanity at this point. my eating hasn't changed yet my mental state is becoming a growing concern. i guess my biggest question is how can i let someone who has never experienced something like this know that not taking my concerns seriously is a really bad idea in terms of not slipping back into hold habits and losing my sanity at the same time.",

"my mom body shaming me when i was literally underweight, and now again when i m at healthy weight.. i have suffered from a really bad restrictive disorder that made me really underweight, ever since i was a teen. it mainly was caused by my mom for body shaming me and telling me to exercise. at my worst, when i was literally underweight, my mom told me that my body looked like a young boy, stick thin, and that no one would love me if i so skinny. of course, i ignored what she said as i thought this was what she wanted. that was when i was at my lowest, i felt miserable for a few years. but, i decided to recover for myself as i didn t want the huge side effects of restriction to affect me. a few months ago, i started eating more, letting myself eat foods that i loved that i never got to eat because of my disorder, and then, started to gain weight. at a visit to the doctor, i gained to a weight that is literally a healthy teen weight for my age and height. yet, my mom is now commenting about how i should now lose 1 pound a week, and that i m starting to look like a pig, even though i didn t drastically change that much. my moms constant bickering and body shaming is starting to affect my mental health and i m really starting to hate my body. i don t know what to do, as i have no one else to talk to about this. any advice will be helpful ",

"trouble maintaining recovery while alone. hi all so i ve been in recovery basically recovered for several years now, and i even do body activism very very often. every once in a while, i ll deal with urges to act on old restricting behaviors, but i d typically either be able to talk myself out of them or i could lean on my husband or others around me for help and support typically distraction or reminders that, hey, it s time to eat i need food to get through my day . however, my husband recently got a job that keeps him out of the house for most of the day, and i ve been struggling with not falling into old patterns. i work from home, so i m completely alone most of the time, which also makes it hard to like, just eat when other people are eating as a social thing. it s waaaaay too easy to just push meals back a little since i have absolutely no accountability, and somewhat accidental behaviors are begetting real thoughts, which sucks. like, i ll not eat lunch on accident because my hunger cues are still kind of busted, and then the eating disorder voice in my head will be like ooh this is just like when you were skinny, we should keep this up . has anyone else dealt with this? i also don t really feel like i have a good support network to talk to about this kind of thing, because either people don t know about my having had an ed or they do know and i m scared they ll be worried or mad at me since i m supposed to be so far past this. it just sucks too because i feel like my ed is a cockroach at this point that s just so hard to kill because it s like i talk about recovery and my reasons for recovering all the time. things that used to be anchors for me feel like they re just dissipating or aren t as effective anymore and i don t know why. i feel like i ve made an ed superbug and idk what to do.",

"after a lifelong battle with food i found a solution that works....if i work it . basically i got beat down by my binge eating amp; wt loss attempts. i started as a child to use food for comfort, boredom, entertainment, lonliness and any other reason. i started dieting at age 12. i tried the things most people try. i'd have success and wt loss. get patted on the back and feel good, but it wouldn't last. why? hadn't i arrived? hadn't i achieved what i worked so hard for. for reasons i didn't understand and put much time into therapy trying to unpack i would go back to compulsive eating. it would get worse overtime. i would go to exremes with food eating wt. at times i was morbidly obese, other times i looked like a fitness insructor. to compensate for my eating i would compulsively exercise, throw off my hormone balance and gave myself a hernia. i cut out all carbs at one point and then started to compulsively eat salad. i worked in a career where i needed to model good health why couldn't i do it for good and all? with all this i came to realize i was screwed between the ears when it came to managing food wt eating. i tried all the options normal eaters try. i'd have temporary success. eventually i'd go back to compulsive eating eating outside of nourishment . i was baffled. why did the things that worked for normal eaters not work for me? i learned in the 12 step program that i have an actual illness of the mind and body, but it centers in my mind. my mind will always take me back to compulsive eating as a solution because i am just wired that way. at rest my spirit is disturbed and it's only a matter of time before i compulsively eat. that is why i keep going back to it even when i swear off and have every reason to stop. i could stop compulsively eating, but i could not stay stopped. also, i could not stop myself in the middle of a binge i'd lose control and go on a spree eating way more than intended. i wondered if i was doomed? it sure felt that way. then i came to oa. i got on a meeting amp; listened. later spoke with a sponsor, heard her story and it resononated with me. i asked her to sponsor me. the vital actions i took were getting a sponsor someone already recovered who could guide me through the steps and help me see things my sick unrecovered mind could not see and work the 12 steps quickly out of the big book of aa, adapted for compulsive eating to get recovered. oa was definitely the last house on the block for me and it needed to be. how else would i know how powerless i am. i had to hit rock bottom with my compulsive eating before i'd have the willingness, open mindedness and humility to say i can't do this on my own. my logic amp; willpower can't fix this i needed help and became willing to do anything to recover. my behavior was leading me to a life full of health problems and an early death if i stayed on that path. today, miraculously i can eat for nourishment. i no longer turn to food to ""fix"" the way i feel or ""to deal"" with life stressors or situations i feel i have no control. i am free. i am grateful to have the 12 step program and work the steps because life is so much now. i'm a saner, happier person. when i get disturbed by life or whatever happens i work the steps and i stay free. i'm grateful i have a solution that works.. if i work it i'm a recovered sponsor and happy to chat more if you like. feel free to dm me.",

"struggling with chronic gastro illness amp; being trans. i think i have an eating disorder. i ve always had a bad relationship with food esp now that i have a chronic gastro condition that causes me to throw up on a pretty regular basis. thus, i ve become really avoidant of food and always feel nauseous. in many ways, i do genuinely try to eat but struggle a lot. i ll have little interest in food or when i try to eat something i typically like it can feel wrong in my mouth and almost make me gag. but i really realized that this might be an actual eating disorder after yesterday; i hadn t eaten much in the past few days so i got a bagel. i pushed myself to eat half and was proud of myself, but then the whole day went by and i didn t eat anything else, and when i realized that late at night i was kind of felt happy? powerful? which obv is bad. i ve been small the entirety of my life and plenty of people tell me i should bulk up to try to help me pass as a man, so i would try harder to eat and start working out with a trainer, but every time i went to weigh myself and check on my progress, i would be relieved when i was still under what s considered a healthy weight. when i was a girl, i was always praised for being petite and having a perfect female body, and for a while it became that if i had to be a girl i wanted to be the most attractive of girls, and i guess a lot of that still lives within me. i m not really sure what to do about all this since i have no job, no insurance, and have just moved state so have no established relationship with any medical professional. who knows how much longer until i m homeless too, which makes it worse; the less i eat the more money i save. i know eating disorders can be pretty rampant in the trans community so i d really just appreciate some thought and ideas from others who have been through this.",

"i think i have an ed and i finally reported it to my doctor before our appointment this week. 28f anxiety, depression, adhd amp; pcos i would like to know what some options for treatment or recovery are if you ve dealt with the same things as i have.. i ve avoided seeking help because i was overweight and anytime i was trying to get help for my pcos doctors told me to lose the weight. this started at age 16 17. sometimes i genuinely forget to eat and because i have adhd i can zoom through the day on nothing but the power of whatever excites me. i loved school because of the structure for eating breakfast or breakfast programs but when i hit post secondary onwards everything fell apart. i would not eat, come home, and eat everything with no control. the adhd would have me hyperfixate on one type of food and luckily last year it was healthy foods, but now i can t seem to eat enough at a consistent rate and make up for it by eating too much at night eg 1 full standard bag of chips because of this it would affect my pcos and then insulin and it becomes an ever ending cycle. when i am particularly anxious or burnt out i have no urge to eat which has been detrimental to my adult life 1 years have gone by and i ve not gotten much done with my life meanwhile my peers and friends with similar struggles have moved on and found strength and courage to push forward. i don t think people at home take me seriously when i mention i may have an ed because they still continue with the fat jokes. i have a close friend who i love a lot, and grew up with and she s always been slim and fit but since we were kids she d always point out her pot belly and hate on it so much. i ve always been the fat one but i know her comments are self directed but i feel like hearing that kind of dictated how i started to see my body as it was growing and changing. i still get triggered by it but i don t have the guts to shoot it down, instead i try to keep it lighthearted. i do want to lose weight so my insulin levels are stabilized and my periods can regulate themselves but the biggest blockage in my future journey is my ongoing eating struggle. the anxiety doesn t help, neither does me wanting to eat in privacy. i found strength training to be amazing for my body and mental health, but without the right eating habits i won t be able to fuel my progress. my brother, someone who is very precise about things advised i use a scale to measure my portions but as i do that i m worried i may trigger a new set of eating issues. i would like to know if you ve experienced something similar if so how did you work through it or what supports were available to you. because of my health i do fall under the low income category and i am canadian so if you can keep this in mind when providing solutions i would greatly appreciate it. i would like to make some lifelong changes in a sustainable way because i ve lost my 2 s and hope i can actually live a live and become a person in my 3 s. things i ve tried good and bad : looking up things online,portion control, alarms, exercise, dieting which i regret so much, cbt counselling which wasn t the right fit, texting crisis lines incase it got bad. my next step is finally telling my doctor and see what is available through them. i know i can change my life if i can learn to balance everything, including being kinder to myself.",

"r antilookism: subreddit dedicated to challenging lookism in society. hi all, i've recently started a sub dedicated to challenging lookism in society. i suffer from body dysmorphia and developed binge eating disorder as a coping mechanism for trauma. i believe that we are victims of both our own psychology and society's unattainable aesthetic ideals. body image distortion is not a new phenomenon, but society's hyperfixation on beauty and body image has intensified the condition for many, and worsened morbidity. bdd and ed's are actually becoming more commonplace. their prevalence is rising among adolescents. airbrushing, selfies and the normalisation of advanced photo editing tools are all , in part, responsible. the result is an escalation of body shaming, and self hatred. i started r antilookism because of my bdd. it led me to self harm and suicide, and it has wrought mayhem in my life. i believe that, while neurology plays a part, we also have to challenge and question lookism in society, as this is a massive contributory factor. r antilookism encompasses eating disorders, facial difference, bdd and the plus sized. the idea is to create a space for activism and mutual support. i'm hoping that people will be able to use it to promote protests and matches. certainly we have just cause to protest about appearance based discrimination in the workplace; the total lack of legislation and the media's perpetuation of beauty myths. society expects us to achieve a kind of aesthetic perfection. for many of us it is this impossible demand which led to our conditions. at r antilookism i'm hoping we'll be able to raise awareness. come and share your story ",

"how to stop obsessing over food?. these days it feels like almost all of my thoughts and actions relate to food and my weight. i always think about the amount of calories i consume, how to get away with purging, how many hours should i spend on exercise in order to burn as much calories as possible. it's like almost my entire world is revolving around that. things i used to enjoy too are taking the backseat. not to mention that i'm entering my last year of highschool, dedication to my studies will be more important than ever. so while my current habits haven't brought any consequences during the summer, i have no doubt that they'd show themselves soon. so yeah, i'd be glad for any advice on how to set my thinking straight.",

"hard time picking things to eat?. cw: food, making food, not eating, food craving, health, food denial?? i have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, and i'm not asking anyone here to confirm or deny the possibility or diagnose me. i am having an issue that i feel like this community may have experience with and could offer some advice. i am having a hard time picking something to eat or making myself eat something that is not the food i am craving. many days, i really really crave fast food, but i want to limit my intake due to health concerns. diabetes runs rampant in my family and the older i get, the more concerned i am with the direction my health could go if i don't start eating foods more suited for diabetic or pre diabetic people. also, eating fast food all the time is expensive and i'm trying to save money. i mean, look at this economy, amirite? additionally, i've realized that i've internalized some judgement now that my significant other and i are living together and they have never been one to eat fast food a lot. they are smaller and i am a big person. they've never judged me for my body size or commented negatively on what i eat, but i accidentally created a dialog in my head about it anyway. the problem is, if i can't eat what i'm craving, picking something else feels impossible. i feel frustrated and angry and sad that i'm not eating the thing i want to be eating. i want to cry. my partner tries to help by suggesting things i could make, but that honestly makes me even more frustrated and want to cry more. i see everything that i can make. i already have gone over every possible thing i could make in the house and none of them are going to replace what i really want to eat. on top of this, whenever my partner leaves to visit parents or hike or something, i always immediately go out and get fast food. and then i freaking hide the evidence like i committed a crime or something. on top of all of that, i have huge anxiety with cooking. so trying to foods, new recipes, etc is so stressful for me. i look at a recipe and i want to break down in tears. my mother never taught me how to cook so as an adult on my own, i've always ordered in or just ate chicken nuggets. i feel so inadequate compared to my partner whose family has always cooked meals at home. i'm so lost. i've tried explaining some of this to my therapist but i don't think she understands or is qualified to offer coaching on eating disorders??? that's what i'm starting to feel like this is becoming . is there anyone who has been through something similar? what helped you? does this sound like something i should explore with a therapist who is educated on disordered eating instead of asking for help from reddit?",

"wondering if i am developing an eating disorder. greetings everyone, i am 2 years old and i think i may be developing an eating disorder. i used to be pretty out of shape and recently lost a lot of weight. although now i feel in good shape and look the best i ve ever looked. i feel like i may be damaging my mental and physical health through eating. it all started with simply lowering my calories to lose weight which worked out in my favor. as time went on i started to be more and more detailed with what i ate. i completely cut out unhealthy foods and only ate things that deemed healthy to me. i get in a cycle of eating healthy for 4 5 days then completely binge eat out of control. i recently started weighing my food and tracking it to the exact calorie. i seem to also have a fear of gaining all the weight back that i lost. i get very upset after a binge eat session and i feel like they re happening more and more frequently. i also feel the need to do excessive amounts of cardio to burn off the binge. hopefully i am simply overreacting about all of this but i figured there is nothing wrong with some extra opinions. thanks everyone",

"realizing as an adult that my parents taught me bad relationships with food. hi, i have struggled with disordered eating all my life. in high school i became obsessive after a traumatic event and developed anorexic habits. after a year i couldn t stand the comments and the low energy anymore so i started to eat again but this turned into binging. and that turned into taking laxatives. to this day i wonder if i severely impacted my health putting myself through all of this. i remember being angry with my parents because i was obviously hurting and they couldn t help me. as an adult i realize the eating habits they passed down to me and the environment that created for my eating disorder. and now, i m at my healthiest concerning my relationship with food, but i still get triggered by my parents comments. it is difficult to eat with them. they often eat large amounts of food in one sitting and designate or justify it the meal of the day . this is unhealthy because they will go long periods without eating and then eat something relatively unhealthy. they also have developed bully habits possibly out of insecurity and will make comments about how much food is left on some one else plate. even mine after all we have been through, they continue to make comments about what i choose to eat and how much i eat. it s frustrating to say the least. my goal with sharing this is to hopefully point of that our families can teach us the foundations of our disorders without really realizing it.",

"do i have an eating disorder or disordered eating?. hey guys i wasn t sure where else to go, so i m just popping by on here. i was wondering if i have an eating disorder, have disordered eating, or if what i do is sorta normal. i typically stick to one meal a day, and i usually eat less than a healthy recommended amount of calories when i do eat more. i don t purge, but i do fast. the longest i ve gone without eating is three days. if i do binge this is rare, maybe a couple times a month i can eat about double the recommended caloric intake for someone and it s all junk food chocolate, chips, candies, pie, etc. if you guys couldn t tell, i count my calories. it s gotten to the point that my weight fluctuates a lot monthly. i have food guilt every single time without fail when i do eat so much so that i ve been contemplating purging via vomiting or dieter s tea. this all probably stems from food insecurity throughout my life and my mom s own dieting habits. i ve told my psychiatrist about this before, but it was sorta waved off and not talked about in depth. i would just like some answers for some peace of mind. thanks for your time lt;3",

"i obsess over food and i don t know how to frame this to my therapist.. hey i m a 17f. i am very active in that i workout and play soccer. i ran cross country for several years, play outdoors with family and friends, and i spend lots of time in nature hiking, fishing, and kayaking. because of all this, food intake is really important to me. i log everything i eat. i weigh foods out when i can, and i consult nutrition guides at restaurants. if i eat it, i will track it. i also weigh myself at least three times a day when i can. i know it s not a good measure of how much i ve actually gained or lost, but i track it because i want to know how it affects my performance. i am a healthy weight, and i don t have plans on making big gains or cuts. therefore, i try to keep my weight within 2 pounds of my preferred weight. if i m up or down 2 pounds, i don t see it as a problem as long as it starts trending back to where i want it. i think i m done growing or at least close to it, so i don t want to fluctuate too much anymore. i m not bulimic or anorexic, i just monitor how much to take in very closely. right now, i attend monthly talk therapy sessions for anxiety and depression. it s been helpful to just talk things out with someone who won t use my mental health against me. i just don t know if talk therapy is helpful for how much i obsess over food. i think about it literally all the time, not in a way like i m hungry, but i just can t get it out of my mind sometimes. like, i need to know how meals, gum, certain kinds of water, or whatever will affect me. i need to know how my weight fluctuates so i can time activities better. is this making any sense? i don t feel like i m spiraling out to control, but i also want to make sure i can capably explain this to a mental health professional.",

how to help adult child with anorexia?. hi all i hope this is allowed. my 19 year old has struggled with anorexia on and off for 3 years it usually gets really bad this time of year. right now she hasn t eaten for 2 weeks. is there anything i can do or say to help her? we talk about it every day and i ve encouraged her to at least get an ensure or boost shake in. i ve been down this road myself but for medical reasons not an ed and i know how hard it is to start eating again once you stop. i m desperate to help her but i don t know how. edit: thank you all so much. i don t think you realize how desperate i was last night to talk to someone about it. the threatening used to work when she was younger and i had more control in her life but not so much as an adult. i m happy to say she ate a bit last night and is drinking a smoothie this morning and had some fruit. i got her some ensure shakes too. she is terrified of counseling but has agreed to give it a shot. she s still on my insurance for two more years and i just was like you re running out of time. i know that this is a lifelong thing and there s no simple cure but i m dedicated.,
"the thought of food makes me gag. hi. i'm 19, i've had a past of really restrictive eating but ive been doing better recently. that is, until a couple months ago when i started working. i barely eat at work, and often end up too exhausted to eat afterwards, both because of being physically tired amp; because of having other mental issues that drain my energy. i've reached a point where i barely eat, and often choose to go to sleep just to not go through the effort of eating. i'd sleep 14hrs a day just to not be awake to eat. i have this general lack of appetite, even before it got this bad, where i feel hungry but don't really want to eat anything. everything just sounds kinda gross. now, it escalated to the point of gagging or feeling nauseous at the thought of eating. even worse than, when i do find myself eating, i become aware that i am and every bite turns from excruciating to impossible. i just gag and have to set the food aside. i'm so exhausted by this, i don't know what this is, and i will also be seeking professional help soon. right now i'm just scared, and want to see if anyone has any tips or been through this. thank you.",

"i won't stop gaining weight and my hunger cues are whack after over a year in recovery. hey all, i've been struggling with eating disorders for almost twelve years now and i've been in recovery for a little over a year. it's going okay except that my hunger cues never really seem to settle. they're all over the place. i can get hungry but by the time i've walked over to the kitchen for a snack i'm full again. i will feel full after a meal, but i rarely feel fully satisfied at the same time, i usually don't want to eat more still does that make sense at all lol . specifically this happens; i will eat plenty of food and feel okay during the day. no cravings or strong hunger indications. however, as soon as i go to bed, i will get hungry. i will, without failure, wake up every night at around 2am 4am and be hungry. like, ravenously hungry. no matter how much i've eaten the day before. this interfers with my sleep and is generally unpleasant since i can't fall back asleep for a couple of hours. for a while i would get up and eat, but that reinforced a bad circle of making me less hungry during the day and even more ravenous when i woke up during the night. this is how my binge eating episodes started, so i'd rather not keep doing that. i am also at a normal weight and have been for a while, but i keep gaining weight which freaks me out a bit. i just keep eating more and more during the day to avoid waking up in the middle of the night, which always fails. i never feel like i can trust my hunger cues and i have a strong feeling that i will keep eating more and gain weight forever and it sucks. for the record; i exercise and everything in my body is working my period is back and regular after 1 years of absence and i'm not cold or losing hair or anything like that . i usually eat 5 6 meals a day spread out so i eat like every 2 5h. no calorie counting at all. has anyone else experienced this? what can i do? i don't want to gain more but i don't want to relapse either.",

"visiting my boyfriends' parents triggers my binging and restricting behaviour. a throwaway account because i don't feel comfortable sharing this on my main one. i have a history of a binge and restrict cycle, which i'm able to have in control most of the time. so, they live quite far away and in the countryside, so we always stay for couple days whenever we go for a visit. i usually cook vegetarian or vegan food when i'm cooking for myself and my bf, but i eat whatever is served when i'm at someone else's place. i don't want to be a burden and ask for anything special, because i don't even have any diagnoses of a lactose intolerance etc. his parents are nice and i love visiting them, but the amounts of red meat, sugary salty creamy food and carbs the mom cooks and bakes for us is too much for me. we always eat together so there's no way i'd be able to skip anything. once i tried to cut myself a smaller piece of pork ribs and his dad immediately commented on that. feels like they expect me to eat the same amount as everyone else in the household they only have adult sons, and his mom is obese . his mom usually has prepared at least two to three different kinds of cakes and or pies for afternoon snack. she always adds extra sugar or salt to whatever she cooks or bakes. and every time there's still some food left, the dad pressures us to take another round and eat it all so it wouldn't go to waste. since bingeing seems to be enabled and encouraged, i end up eating more than i normally do. sometimes i continue to binge at home as well, because the cravings get out of control. after the long weekend of eating all that, i get very bloated. and when i'm very bloated, i get the urge to start restricting very heavily. now that i think of it, my longest and ""the worst"" restrictive episode was right after coming home from his parents three years ago. has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you manage to overcome it? i feel uncomfortable telling his mom about my problems, because i feel like she wouldn't understand and maybe even take it as an insult. i hate having this battle in my head for weeks after every time we visit them..",

"how to rewire thoughts in eating disorder recovery and get out of quasi recovery?. hi, so basically i have suffered with multiple eating disorders for around 5 years now and have had multiple relapses and never truly recovered. however, now i am truly choosing recovery it started with a 'diet' which lead to anorexia and bingeing. this then spiralled into continuous binges so i got help at the hospital and the bingeing stopped, however i feel like i never truly recognised my hunger for years after that and would just eat whenever i felt like it and kind of overate, leading to weight gain. this weight gain caused me to go back onto a diet, spiralling back into disordered eating patterns and ana. anyways, i believe i am recovering well from ana as i no longer aspire to lose weight and try not to body check and am at a normal weight now, however i still stress about when to eat. i have started intuitive eating and i can feel hunger and fullness cues when i am distracted and not anxious, however when i am left alone with my thoughts i am constantly thinking when next i should eat and it sort of leads me to overeat cos its like my brain tricks me into emotional hunger. also, i could be hungry however my appetite goes as the stress of deciding if im actually hungry or not causes me anxiety and guilt. i have gone back to the gym as i do want to lead a healthy lifestyle and stay in shape, however do not count calories and eat what i crave as long as i am hungry i try but still sometimes overeat . anyways, my question is how do i get out of this quasi recovery and stop thinking and stressing about food, like i am not trying to lose weight, i guess you could say i am trying to suppress drastic weight gain but isn't that normal? i just want to make sure i am healthy but feel like i am self sabotaging myself. i feel like because i've been eating out a lot recently i have gained a bit of weight and that isn't the norm for me to eat out that much but it has triggered me. maybe i need to completely stop body checking but i am trying but i feel stuck on how to have the mindset of 'i eat what feels good to me,' as my anxiety causes me to think 'what if that causes you to gain loadssss of weight?' i just want to know how to brush off these thoughts after i eat and be able to focus on other things? thank you",

"struggling to eat intuitively. i am really struggling at the moment i've been in recovery for a few years now and for the most part i've been successful successful in whatever ways that means to me . recently, however, i've really been struggling with things like knowing when to stop eating but similarly knowing when it's an appropriate time to honour my hunger if that makes any sense? i yo yo'd with binging and restricting over the years so i have struggles on both sides, something i'm sure many of you can relate with. the past restriction has triggered a sense of fear in me when it comes to feeling hungry; if i feel hungry my brain gets scared i'm slipping back into those bad habits which then triggers a binge and so the cycle continues. my problem at the moment, because life has gotten so busy and is only getting busier i'm worried that i'll fall back into the full trap of it as i now has so much less time to really focus on it all. if anyone has any tips on how to handle this kind of situation i'd really appreciate the advice ",

my girlfriend has an eating disorder and i don t know how to help. so for at least 2 years my girlfriend has been doing things to loose weight. at first it was missing a meal to then not eating for a day and so on but for the past year and a half she s started doing worse things like making herself sick after most if not every meal and counting calories and working out an extreme amount. there s been periods of time where i think it s starting to get better and eat more and that she s finally seeing that there s nothing wrong with herself and that she s beautiful which i try to tell her as much as i can but then she usually goes through a binge eating phrase that sets her off again and it gets worse each time sometimes she refuse to have a drink worrying that she might become bloated. there s also times when she s not eating and everything else where she wants to get help and we talk and see what s going to help her best what i can do what she needs to do and so on but then the next day she could just switch and refuse any sort of help. i ve done everything i could possibly think of to try and help i ve watched many videos read many things online about how to help and tried everything i ve seen but nothing seems to be helping i ve been trying to get her to see a therapist or professional help but that s a dead end. i m starting to get really worried as last summer was really hard always wearing hoodies and joggers plus not eating i honestly don t know how she isn t dead and im afraid that if it happens again this summer it ll be worse. now i know that she won t get better a straight away and that it ll be a lengthy process but any advice and help would be great just so there s something to start the help with tia.,

"so i need some advice from you guys... i don't know what to think about this.. trigger warning: this post contains talk about weight, no numbers are mentioned, body image, mentions of behaviors such as calories counting, purging, excessive exercising, binging. stay safe hi i'm lillith, just to put down some context, i'm a minor, undiagnosed, and while i can't officially say that i have an ed, it's pretty obvious that i do. my ed kinda consists of what i call ""phases"" i have a phase where i'm full on counting calories, skipping meals, liquid cals at best, smoking to cut hunger, drinking a lot, exercising. then the other is binging. it doesn't stsy long a week or so and doesn't happen often, it's triggered when i don't get food i'm body for a long time and start watching mukbangs and stuff about food, i then feel guilty and gross and go back to the other phase. sometimes when i have no choice i eat like a ""normal person"" but try to burn it off by exercising i do at home biking and sometimes sit ups . what triggers me, weirdly, are compliments. i had gained a lot during the summer bc i did nothing but stay in my room and would snake a lot, i shed the pounds naturally when i got back to school because i would have sports classes, would walk around the school everyday and couldn't snake at school. tw: numbers talk about my weight so i went from an average weight in august, to a low average weight in november. then i started getting a lot of compliments from a lil group of younger girls at my school my friends called them my fangirls they would say i was pretty and all, then sometimes they would hug me and say, wow you're so thin that's so cool i crave compliments, affection, i want to keep it forever, i have a past with bullying and parents i disappointed cuz i wasn't diagnosed with adhd until 8th grade so really . i would rarely get compliments, so now i do everything to keep them. while i was someone who didn't want to care about they way i looked because i knew i was too mentally unstable for it lol, this triggered something in me. my mom also made comments me she saw me eating snack ""be careful you're going to end up like this summer"" i slowly started to get obsessed with my weight, and a goal of being underweight made its way into my head. so here was the starting point of my ed. now i'm kinda deep into it but it's summer break so skipping meals is hard, i try to exercise, i skipped meals when my parents worked, now they don't so i can't. but i also got into the binging phase until 2 days ago. here's the thing, i don't like throwing up, but that didn't stop me from trying to make myself purge, i've never been able to though. until today, i was trying to purge but couldn't, i went on internet, searched ""how to make yourself puke"" found something, tried it once, succeeded. i did about three times until i just couldn't bc i still don't like to throw up. i exercised a lot today, purged, and skipped to meals, and drank a lot of water. i felt the dizziness i feel when ""it's working"" i'm used to it and it's strangely satisfying since i associate it with weight loss. the purging too, while i still don't like to puke, i had this feeling of satisfaction. now, i don't know what to think about this... did i just achieved a new, dangerous, step into my ed? or is it just me being dramatic about it, and i probably won't pick up on this behavior? searching for some advice : i hope what i said was clear, have a nice day night ",

"option for hloc or staying at a lower level thoughts suggestions??. cross post failed for some reason so i m reposting hi all for background, i am currently in iop following an an relapse. i ve been at my current program for a month and a half and have made some really good progress, but i ve also somewhat plateaued and am still engaging in a range of ed behaviors. my treatment team is recommending i spend a couple weeks at a hloc as sort of a tune up jump start as they feel discharging me with my current frequency using certain behaviors could be very risky. i am a student, and they re concerned that without extra intervention i ll backslide at the start of the school year. me and my outpatient team were all somewhat surprised by this suggestion as i have generally been eating adequate amounts each day even with some restriction compulsive exercise for example, might restrict at a meal but overall intake for the day is good, or might make ed driven food choices but they still minimally meet my meal plan, or do some compulsive exercise but at low frequency intensity . my outpatient team basically said this would be a somewhat unusual step up in treatment bc it wouldn t be the result of me doing super badly in iop but instead a sort of safeguard method to get me doing even better and get out of this stuck zone. iop team confirmed that i m very compliant and engaged and that a some things are going well, they just see areas i m still struggling and that they think would be good to improve. my op team definitely hasn t discouraged me from trying a hloc but agreed with me that it might not be necessary and that this is ultimately my choice based on what i think will help me and whether i m willing to engage with the process. i m not opposed to trying a hloc for a short period because i really truly want to recover, but i m also concerned being at a hloc will surround me with people who are much sicker in a way that will be really distressing or something. i also feel a bit resentful towards my iop team that what im doing now isn t good enough and don t like the idea of putting myself in a position with less autonomy. has anyone been in this position before? if so, how did you respond? or if not, suggestions after reading through my ramble? i also want to acknowledge that, as someone with an ed, i am by definition not an objective judge of my behavior bc i m biased towards minimizing and my ed fights very hard to maintain it s control. i think a lot of my confusion indecision now is because my op team agrees this isn t absolutely necessary, which has left me uncertain how to proceed.",

"picky eating. i haven't been diagnosed with an eating disorder. i don't really know what my problem is. i am clearly neurodivergent, though i don't really have access to testing for it. i mention that because i think it plays into my food struggles. i recently looked in the arfid community, but my picky eating is more situational. i don't have a list of foods i can eat so much as: when i'm stressed, in an unfamiliar environment, or just extremely hungry, my options for food become extremely limited. today for example, i'm home, not stressed, but not feeling my best because of chronic pain and a long day at work. i'm trying to eat dinner, but nothing sounds acceptable to my brain. i have certain foods i can almost always eat rice, instant ramen, salad if there are greens prepared, etc but even those are impossible right now. the only things i was able to make myself eat were a chocolate rice cake and some shortbread cookies, both of which are extremely high in sugar, low in nutrients, and not filling. i'm so hungry but i just can't eat. i'm sure it'll pass eventually, or i'll go to bed and just eat in the morning, but it's hard to be hungry and not be able to eat because of completely internal factors. on top of that i struggle with my view of food as a whole, which doesn't help. i count calories, restrict until i'm so hungry, and then overeat and feel guilty. it's a nasty cycle. i also have ocd which presents in a lot of ways for me. i know i'm not really asking a question or anything, but i'd love to hear if anyone has any advice or can relate.",

"worried about possibly unjustified extreme hunger. hey everyone, i m a college student who s very worried about the intense hunger i ve experienced since end of april . for context, i began going on a diet starting november of last year. i set a limit on calorie intake i'm not including a specific number, but it's around the lower bound of recommended intake for an adult woman . at first, i could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. i started to have binging episodes once a week. there s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2 3am i would go there and buy candy and chips. feeling guilty, i tried to eat very little the next day. during winter break, i ate almost the same food items for breakfast and then nothing else for the rest of the day. when school resumed, i tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. the foods i ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them. towards the end of march, i decided to end my terrible dieting practices. i began eating as much as i wanted. but i soon noticed that i almost never felt full. no matter how much i ate for every meal and snack, i wanted to eat more. my constant hunger intensified in may, and ever since i would eat as much as two or three meals worth of food for each meal. i m writing because i m concerned about my health; i eat so much that i continue to rapidly gain weight, and i m worried this will eventually lead to obesity. i am nearing being overweight in the bmi range . i feel like i didn t restrict to an extreme degree while i was dieting. consequently, i don t understand why i m experiencing such intense hunger for such a long time. my lab results also don t indicate any underlying medical condition. tldr: i didn t heavily restrict while dieting, so my unending extreme hunger feels unjustified. i m afraid of what will happen to me if this continues.

"sometimes i just hate the idea of food or get stressed out because i don't know what i want to eat. hi, this will be a long one and i really hope i can get some help. at the start of the pandemic, something happened that never happened before i started getting disgusted at the idea of food and just avoided it as much as i could but still ate when pushed. however it was honestly not something i wanted to do. it was the idea of chewing food, for some reason, that almost made me angry. i was under a lot of stress then because of the pandemic and i was worried about courses in university to the extent where i felt like my life was being stolen from me obviously other issues were there . basically, it was an exceptional situation. however, i have noticed that since then 2 years back i have developed a habit of periodically not knowing what to eat and feeling ashamed about it because no food excites me or i just don't want to eat at all. i eat so i don't get hunger pangs. strange thing is, previously, whenever i got nervous, i overate because food comforted me. i loved and still love food. in fact, in the past, i ate so much i felt sick at times and there were even times when i vomited also unhealthy, i know. i guess i've had a shit relationship with food for a while now . i never caused a fuss about food and for decades ate the same thing without complaint, but now at 24 i have moments where i feel irritated at food overall. i feel embarrassed because this feels like such a petty issue to have. thankfully it hasn't been as severe as the first episode when i ended up losing 8 kgs within 2 months only noticed when other people told me i looked much thinner because i was just not in the right state of mind . anyway, when i recovered, i started intermittent fasting as part of a strict routine that included language learning, bullet journaling, exercising, etc to whip myself out of a funk and dropped 7 more kgs over 5 6 months. all was fine. my parents were always stick thin and still are so i was the odd one out cause my sister is super thin too. i wasn't too bothered by it because i was in a very competitive school and there were far too many things already giving me pressure. i used to be over 1 kgs overweight and am now at a weight considered healthy 65kg, 5ft 5 inch . obviously like many girls my age i wanted to be thin very badly when i was young but with many other kinds of pressures i kind of forgot about it and i was never the kind of girl who was able to starve myself. now however, i suddenly get mad at food or having to eat cause it feels like such an insurmountable task, i don't know why. what i noticed is, this happens every time i'm stressed. it's like i take the rage out on food and eating just feels like another task that must be completed or else. other info i was suicidal twice within a span of 4 years and i have recovered both times quite well though the experience was excruciating. i also have a bit of an issue with anxiety and sometimes anger. but if i may say so myself, i'm pretty strong and am a fighter. just worried about my sudden disgust of food that pops up at times because i will be living alone soon and know it isn't healthy. asking for advice here cause i live in a developing country where some therapists literally tell you to pray your problems away and even if you find a good one, there is heavy social stigma. also i think most aren't trained for this kind of thing. advice and tips would be highly appreciated. thank you.",

"can i get some advice on whether to accept an exciting job offer or go to residential treatment?. i am in an incredible dilemma at the moment. i just graduated college in may, and i've been interviewing for jobs over the summer. i just got a phone call today with an incredible job offer that i would normally be so thrilled about i still am so excited by the prospect of it , would be a great start to my career, and is for a cause i really care about. notably, though, it will be a fast paced, time consuming position, and i would be moving away from my family and friends to take it. i've also been struggling with a relapse into my anorexia for about 2 years now. i was on the path back to recovery for a while last year, and then backslid this spring and have been slowly declining again, and my doctor and therapist are recommending i seek residential treatment in fact, i'm on a waitlist and would probably get admitted in the next couple of weeks. i just heard from my doctor today that my bloodwork came back with alarmingly low glucose, along with some other concerning results. i don't feel the symptoms of any of this i never experience low blood sugar symptoms, apparently because my body has adjusted to it. i know i've lost weight but it's not in a dire place i don't need to be hospitalized or anything like that. i'm getting by, and still eating every meal snack, just probably too little of them. i'm not crashing and burning or anything like that. so i'm at a really terrible crossroads here: option 1 is to accept the job offer and do what i need to do through outpatient treatment, get a dietician and a meal plan and try to keep myself stable and ideally on an upward path as i work this job. fortunately, my doctor is actually located in the city i would be moving to, so i would actually be closer to him and excellent dietician options. option 2 is to turn down my first, pretty much perfect job offer of adulthood and commit to going to residential whenever a spot opens up, and then explore other options once i get out and am more stable. this is hell to try to figure out, and i have two days to think about it. any thoughts advice?",
"be kind to every body. when low rise pants were popular, my pants were already riding lower, showing a little bit more crack than what might be considered cute. i was a bigger kid. other kids noticed, and they made me aware of it too. i think growing up in a bigger body makes you feel like you don t deserve the desirability associated with smaller bodies. i used to hate the doctors office. the scale would continue to rise so many pounds every year, and the doctor never failed to suggest that i increase my fruit and vegetable intake . i would leave with the sheet of my bmi face down in the dashboard of my mom s volvo, hoping that she wouldn t bring it up after our next meal. i had great friends in high school. great friends. we laughed so hard and were so content with each other, i never even noticed that no men liked me. when it came time to being asked to dances, i was always the last to have a date. my friends were nice enough to pair me with a friend of theirs, but i always felt like such a burden as their heavier escort. going to visit my nana in arizona felt like being a steak being inspected at the meat packing docks. my 5 1 nana would insert her exact weight that she weighed when she was married. i would smile and continue to cover the rolls of my stomach with my arms while i sat on her corduroy couch. when we went swimming she would tell me that i needed to slim down, and i would stay behind and let the others go ahead. i would reflect on how unlucky i was to be so ugly. if nana said it, it must be how others saw me too. my freshman of college was one of the worst years of my life. girls wanted pretty roommates to meet sigma chi s. i felt like a burden to my dorm floor for wasting so much space with my larger body. i hated the way guys ignored me, i hated the way i looked in the mirrors of college library, but i loved the way snacks comforted my freshman sorrows. the summer after freshman year, i wanted to prove them wrong. i wanted to feel noticed. i heard about the keto diet and how it had worked wonders for a family friend. i took a deep dive and only ate meat and dairy that whole summer. i did not allow for a single speck of brown sugar to fall near my spoon. i started walking and held strict to my regimen. people noticed. i was receiving praise for my hard work, and this time it was personal. i felt like i was finally being seen. i returned to my sorority house and was suddenly well liked. i had my first fling and loved the idea of someone liking me, and my exterior in the ball pit of praise and compliments to my extremely thin stature, there was a girl screaming for help. i had completely forgotten what it was like to walk up the stairs without the feeling of fainting. i had forgotten the taste of fruit. i had cried when my mom marinated the chicken in teriyaki. the diet won. i had signed my soul away to be what i believed was beautiful. i was thin i was disintegrating into half of who i deserved to be. the next year was spent miserably alone in covid. i would either eat the entire house and it s packaging, or nothing at all for days. there was no in between and my life felt out of control. a horrible year and summer. but nobody noticed. nobody cared because i was a healthy weight. i had good grades, and i smiled when people greeted. at the end of summer 2 21 i was saved. i was invited to a friends lake house in south carolina. we went hiking and swimming and the most revolutionary idea was introduced to me. they all ate breakfast. each day, every one there had something to eat. whether it was toast and eggs, yogurt bowls or avocado toast. all of them recognized the value in eating, even if they weren t expiring from hunger. they all ate cake at night and woke up the next day looking the same. i was beginning to see the way life could be. a life not consumed by food. i spent the next year in recovery. i am still in recovery. i love lunch. i love snacks. i love getting up from bed and feeling strong, not lightheaded. i love experiences and i will never limit my social calendar because of my diet. i won? i am happier now. happy as i could be as a girl growing up bigger. be kind to everyone. be kind to every body. the way people treated me before i lost weight will never be forgotten. just the same goes for how i am treated now. your body is a shell that surrounds the fantastic treasure inside be kind to every body.",

"my anxiety feeds into my 'eating disorder'. just to clarify i don't have a diagnosed disorder. i'm sorry if i offend anyone by saying this but i definitely do have some kind of disordered eating so i'm just speaking from my own experience. when i find myself in periods of high anxiety, i don't eat in fear of being sick or just in feeling sick itself due to the anxiety. this then feeds into my food problems as i soon end up making excuses and skipping more and more meals. can anyone else relate and what can i do to stop?",

"does this sound like an ed? please help. hello, here is some background on my weight throughout the years. as a child, i was always thin. i would get bullied from boys and girls about not having an ass or for being too thin. it really upset me. i always wanted to be thicker. i had gone through a lot in my childhood, and especially my early young adult years. a four year toxic and abusive relationship with my first love, he cheated on me with about twenty women that i know of and i always blamed it on my skinniness even though the issue was he was a narcissistic alcoholic that gaslit me though the stress he put me through made me lose more weight, and the drugs i started using didnt help. i left him in in twenty eighteen to go to rehab in ca. i was very underweight from drugs. i gained a lot of weight there and i was actually very happy with that. i stayed out there after rehab and had a great time on my own. but i started to become really unhappy with my weight as time went on. i moved back home with my family in chicago in october two years back and began to lose weight unintentionally. today i am again underweight. i get constant comments. i feel guilty eating at work no matter how hard i try to put it down. i buy thousands of dollars in groceries and takeout every month, and it all rots. i like people to see me with food, to avoid concern but i usually take two bites and throw it away. i only ever feel comfortable eating in bed alone. i forget to eat and most days put down barely any calories. i hate looking at myself, i always wear baggy clothes. i try to workout to gain muscle but it never works. i cry dailyabout my weight. talking about food gives me anxiety. i only want to eat fat on meat, cheeses, some carbs and fruit. even when i know i am hungry, i usually vape or drink caffiene and my appetite goes away. its so strange because i want to gain weight but i feel like i subconsciously prevent myself from doing so. i am considering checking into an inpatient facility because my mental health is in shambles. i am emotionally crippled from my own thoughts and my job. i just am so confused but i want help, and maybe i just need someone to tell me i have an eating disorder because i have a hard time believing that i do. i understand you cant diagnose me, but google is no help. does this sound like an atypical ed? i do have other mental health issues. please ask me anything.",

"ed? which one or none? next step advice?. tw: talk about disordered behaviors and thoughts so i'm a twenty year old female and i've been told by a counselor before that they think i have an eating disorder, but i have never received an actual diagnosis. they said that they weren't specialized enough to give a diagnosis this lack of clarification is making me very confused as to what i should do next whether it urgently needs to be taken care of, where i should go, what level of treatment if i need if i go, ect... honestly, i am not even sure if it is just one disorder, or if it even fits a category of an eating disorder. you see i have always been underweight with poor eating habits like taking hours to eat food, hiding food so i didn't have to eat it, ect... but my eating has gotten significantly worse as i have grown older. i eat around one to one and a half meals which can easily take me hours to finish reach a point where i am satisfied but not full and stop eating , a very low appetite lack of interest in eating most foods, with food intolerances to top it off. this is what i call ""normal eating"", or my version of ""intuitive eating"". i am not consciously forcing myself to not eat. but when i was fourteen, i started getting extremely stressed and overwhelmed and developed periods of ""restrictive eating"". now when ever i get stressed or overwhelmed it triggers these restricting periods as a sort of coping mechanism. during these periods, i am purposefully restricting, counting calories, weighing myself, ect... think common an symptoms. once the stressful situation lessens or ends these behaviors i have lessen and i go back to a ""normal period"" until the next stressful overwhelming situation occurs. all of my bad eating ""habits"" over the past several years have accumulated into me reaching a very low weight. i keep having this pressing feeling that i should get help from professionals, but i am a college student without a lot of money. plus the fall semester is going to start soon and i don't think that will mesh well with ""time intensive treatment"". and while i have this feeling that i need to do something my family doesn't seem worried so i gets me thinking that maybe i am just overreacting? if you guys have any next step advice, treatment recommendations suggestions, if i you think i even have an eating disorder or if i'm just overreacting, or an outside different perspective on what is happening... i would be more that happy for the help and advice p.s. i'm sorry if i broke any community guidelines it's my first time posting. if i did please let me know so that i don't make the same mistake s in the future.",

"how do you talk to a parent about your ed?. ok so i m going to have to give a bit of context so you can understand where i m coming from, the first thing to know going into this is that my mum is a therapist. i have been struggling with anorexia which turned into bed bulimia then back to anorexia now for almost 2 years now i believe, and my mum has been aware of it for a huge part of that. she s taken me to camhs appointments, weigh ins and everything, has spoken to school etc so she knows it s an issue and yet i still feel like she s not taking it seriously or doesn t even believe it s a problem. she used to be more concerned when i was extremely underweight, but due to the binging i have gone back up to a healthy weight although have started to lose it again . to give an example, today i had a really awful body image dysmorphia day and couldn t find a single thing to wear without crying for the best part of an hour. i told my mum eventually through tears that i just felt horrible and disgusting in everything i was wearing and didn t think i could go out and rather than do anything to help or comfort me she just fell asleep. literally just slept on the sofa and refused to help at all. and then in the car decided to tell me that she thought i only did all that because i was pissed off with her obviously not true . she s also the type of parent who as soon as you say one negative thing or ask that she stops doing something that upsets you or whatever, she will just turn it around on her and start saying that s she s a bad parent, or that i hate her or whatever so i don t know how to talk to her about what i m struggling with without that happening. i m moving to uni at the end of september beginning of october so i won t be here much longer but i would really like her to just be able to understand what i m going though and that it s really difficult, you would think as a therapist she would understand but evidently not. anyway, i just don t know what to say without it causing a huge argument but shit like what happened today just really impacts me and i don t know how much more i can take of it.",

"small win went to the dentist after avoiding them for years even though i knew i had a problem. not sure how relevant this is to the sub but no friends i can actually share this with for obvious reasons. growing up i always had issues with my teeth which are probably due to binging tendencies looking back now. my dentist at the time wasn t the nicest of people around it even if he didn t know and always used to make comments like what procedure are we doing today then? and you ve damaged another one sigh . good i got the treatments but his small side comments and attitude made me so anxious about going to the dentist. once i moved location for university i didn t really think anything about finding another dentist. then something came up with one of my teeth a few years ago. at the time i hoped it would just go but obviously that never happened. about a year in i realised the only way to treat it was with antibiotics, but i still wasn t ready to go back to the dentist so i just left it again recently one of my uni friends got a dental procedure done and was speaking about how nice the dentist was so i decided it was finally time to face my fears and have my teeth checked. before this i was expecting him to ask why there are so many cavities etcetera so i was rehearsing mentally how to tell him that i have problems with food i went a few days ago and she was right. super kind, didn t chastise me for my teeth and made sure to explain everything to me so that i could understand it. i know this isn t a step forward for the ed but it s definitely a step forward in my mental and physical health ",
"my friend has been struggling with eating due to abnormally low appetite for a while and it is starting to get worse.. hello. i have a friend who has trouble eating both regularly and in normal quantities. as if it wasn't worrying enough, it appears to be getting worse for no apparent reason. it started a few years ago. it began with him working for long hours and not taking food to work, so he ended up staying without food from 7am to 6pm. he felt fine, so he just kept on doing that. eventually he stopped working for so long, but nowadays he still has very low appetite and can't manage seemingly small portions of food for his weight a lot of the time. hell, he can easily go without eating for two whole days and feel relatively fine. stressful situations make this even worse. what baffles us even more is the fact that he started working out regularly and yet it hasn't made him crave for more food at all, let alone for protein rich dishes. in fact it's after this that his appetite started to get worse. this seems like an important detail: when he does finally decide to eat something, he is likely to lose appetite from looking at the food that is ready to be eaten. despite all this his weight overall is just a little lower than normal, albeit it fluctuates back and forth often, and he doesn't seem to be gaining any muscle mass from going to the gym. if someone or someone you know managed to get through similar kind of problems, please advise what we can do. it's obvious that a visit to a doctor is necessary, but is there anything that can be done until this is possible?",

"extreme hunger and letting go of restriction experiences in recovery. hey guys i m in recovery ish from anorexia and it s been a bumpy road so far. i ve kind of been relapsing lately and since trying to recover a lot of conflicting voices are more present now, more than ever. firstly, there s the ana voice telling me to restrict. secondly, there s the recovery voice telling me i deserve food and should eat more despite being terrified of weight gain. third, there s now this feeling of unstoppable desire to eat anything and everything and a lot of it. i ve read about others who ve experienced the same; extreme hunger. i feel like there hasn t been a lot of official research on extreme hunger so i have conflicting thoughts on what the right thing to do is. tabitha farrar wrote a blog post https: tabithafarrar.com 2 17 2 anorexia recovery eating on the topic, encouraging recovering anorexics to let go of all forms of restricting, to let your body have as much food as you want in recovery. she writes about honoring you body and mind when it tells you to eat entire cakes or jars of peanut butter, for as long as your body wants it. she explains that, at least for her, the extreme desire for food settles after a while. i m curious if any of you guys have any experience with this? what i m terrified of, besides weight gain , is it turning into bed or bulimia the latter is kind of the case for me now, after i ve gained some weight in my semi recovery . if you have time, check out the post she wrote i linked it further up and comment your thoughts ",

"not sure if i have an eating disorder?. so i probably am making excuses now to avoid recovery. anyway, i'm 2 f, and have been having a difficult relationship with food since i was 17 or so. i remember how it started, i was stressed with school and not satisfied with my looks, as i've been a big overweight in the past mainly because i was growing up, but i've heard a dew hurtful comments from my parents about it . i decided to start restricting to lose some weight. at first i went from above healthy weight, then to underweight. i had a lot of problems at that time, including freezing a lot, developing raynauds syndrome not sure if that's the right word, but my fingers lose circulation if i'm stressed or its too cold. i didn't have that problem before, and aside from my grandma no one in my family has this. it might be unrelated , and looking ""sickly"". i frequently got into panic modes if i had to eat something unhealthy or above my limit. fast forward to now, i dont count calories anymore, but in times of stress i get into that controlling mindset again and start restricting again, fasting etc. another factor is that i live with my aunt now, and i'm in college economic situation in my country is bad, so sometimes i don't eat or eat less to save money. i went from still somewhat healthy underweight which was satisfactory for me, to greatly underweight still cool for me aesthetically, i prefer to be underweight but its so tempting to go lower. my bf and family say i should put on some weight, enough to not look so weak and to stop freezing all the time. i know i probably should but i'm scared of gaining weight, i don't want to look like i looked when i was growing up, and restriction is my way to cope with stress and feeling in control. plus it is a form of punishment for me this one definitely a red flag . as i said, my diet is less aggressive now, so i'm not sure if that's an eating disorder or not, and still not sure if i really want to gain some weight.",
"advice for dinner date. i've had a couple of dates with this person who i like a lot and it's been going really well, and she has now suggested we meet for dinner tomorrow. she was very open about her disorder from the start and i feel comfortable asking her questions about it, but now that she has suggested we eat together i don't want to make a big deal of it in case that makes her feel nervous or whatever, so here i am. does anyone have any advice for how i could be supportive without making a whole thing out of it?",

after a parent loss my friend has stopped dating. one of my closest friends lost his mother 6 months ago and the past 3 months he has isolated himself but the thing that worries me the most is the fact he has lost so much weight by not eating. the last time we saw each other was a month ago and he told me he hasn't eaten in 5 days. me and my other friends tried to tell him to eat more because it's not healthy and he simply said he doesnt fell like eating. he is really happy with the weight loss because he was always insecure with his body because he didnt have the perfect body he wanted but i dont think this is the right way to achieve his goal. he isn't good mentally and we dont know how to help him because he doesn't listen. his other parent isn't present in his life and we dont know what to do because he has lost so much weight and he is only drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. i dont know what to do to help him understand that is important to have a balance diet.,

"stomach issues. i've had disordered eating habits on and off for years. unfortunately, last year i relapsed with restriction very badly. however, something different is happening physically to my body this time. i know that anorexia and other eating disorders can cause stomach aches and digestive issues, and that seems to be happening to me. this past year i've been restricting less, but not really recovered per say, but i have very severe stomach pain now. at least once a month for over 8 months i'll be in debilitating pain that almost makes me go to the er. it's so painful, and it's getting worse with every episode. i know you can have temporary symptoms of ibs or other digestive issues while in recovery, but usually i've read they go away once you're further into it. i'm not recovering, and yet, i experience these issues and it's not going away. anyways, my main question is can a person develop actual chronic stomach disorders from restrictive eating disorders anorexia ?",

"wondering if my thoughts about food are worrisome... lately i don t eat as much as i used to. it s not really a conscious thing. sometimes i ll eat one meal in a day, sometimes i ll eat like two meals. i use the term meal very loosely, as it s never very healthy food. usually fast food, subway, etc. sometimes i just am super busy, and then i realize i haven t eaten all day. i ve been having some thoughts pretty often recently, which i m wondering if they re concerning in terms of, is this disordered eating and or thinking? on the days where so far, i ve only eaten one meal for example, today i had three tacos and two burritos from taco bell , i ll find myself hungry again later, and then think to myself something like why am i hungry? i already ate today. and then i think something like i m like oh yeah, most people eat multiple times a day, so it makes sense that i m hungry again i don t try not to eat, and i will eat a second time if i m still hungry, but i m just wondering if that thought process is something i should be concerned about?",
"my husband's body image issues are becoming concerning and affecting my own self image.. hi there. so i'm 28f just looking for some advice i guess regarding my husband 3 m and his body image issues. he suffers very much with his perception of himself to the point that i am sometimes concerned and honestly i'm reaching a point where i am burned out and exasperated with talking about it. i try to be understanding and reassuring to him. he has a very abusive father who he is permanently nc with now for over a year. his father spent basically his whole childhood berating dh for his weight. he was a chubby kid and loved food, but they did nothing to help him. they filled the house with junk food and soda and then berated him, a young child, for taking it. my heart bleeds for him when he tells me the things his father would say to him about his weight just straight up bullying and the things he would do to shame him for it. when he was a teenager, he started losing weight because of something his father said to him that was so hurtful that he says his mind blocked it out and he can't remember exactly what it was. his weight has fluctuated a bit over the years but he's always been a fairly normal, healthy weight. when we met, he was very fit as he was working out a lot and doing keto. he's gained a bit since then, but still looks great; just a little extra. i'm a little chubby myself so i don't care at all. i'm bigger than him, i feel. he, however, is distraught about it all the time. he's tried doing keto again multiple times, but always falls off the wagon because it's honestly just not that doable anymore for him; it impacts our social life and our ability to go out and do fun things together. i've urged him to instead focus on a balanced diet and he agrees, but any time he lets himself have one thing that's not diet friendly, he obsesses over it for days after. he stares at himself in the mirror and grabs at his stomach, turns to the side and sucks in until he looks concave, etc. it worries me a lot. if i wasn't with him almost all the time, i would really worry about him skipping meals. my issue now is that i cannot keep reassuring him multiple times a day. it's starting to negatively affect my own self image and i'm starting to obsess too. i can't handle him saying ""i'm so fat"" and telling him ""you look fine, i like how you look"" twenty times a day. sometimes he even gets annoyed with me for disagreeing, so i don't know what to say. he sees a therapist for other things, and i have been begging him for ages to talk to her honestly about the body image issues, which he acknowledges are a problem, but he won't do it. he thinks if he accepts himself how he is, he won't care about how he looks and he'll get fat, and i don't know how to explain to him that that's not how that works. i'm really at the end of my rope with the endless conversations about his weight but i don't know how to say this to him. i'm so frustrated and sometimes i feel he can tell how tired i am of the conversation. i don't want to hurt him or make him feel like i'm not there for him, but there's nothing more i feel i can do and it's really starting to get into my head and i'm feeling bad about my own body. i don't know what to do. any advice?",
"is it considered an eating disorder to spit out bad food out after chewing and savoring the flavor?. i recently started gaining weight out of no where. for most of my life i'm 22 now i've been able to eat whatever i want without gaining any weight like the rest of my family. i'm constantly moving my body so i'm always burning calories. i haven't asked a doctor yet what's going on with my body, but i've been trying to cut back on junk food so i can lose at least 1 pounds. i'm buying and preparing more healthier dishes and watching youtube videos of women suggesting the types of whole foods and meals i should eat. it's a huge struggle because my tongue is so used to eating sweets and junk that i'm not enjoying this new diet. obviously i'm going to continue this diet so my body is healthy and i'm maintaing a normal body weight. but i really want to eat junk and sweets again as well. i thought long and hard about this. at first i said, ""okay, let's eat some junk and then work out extra harder."" but that sounds like a lot work. so then i asked myself, ""why do you like junk so much?"" the flavor. the taste. sometimes the texture and smell. so then i thought to myself, ""if the only reason you like eating junk is for the taste duh , then why not just chew the food and spit it out? that way, all that bad processed food won't make your body unhealthy, fatigue, etc."". so i took a bite of fried chicken, chewed it, enjoyed the flavor and spit it out. then i took a sip of water to get the aftertaste out of my mouth. i stood there and questioned whether this means i have an eating disorder. a big part of me feels there is nothing wrong with spitting out bad food. i mean, it's bad. we're technically not to supposed to consume processed food like kfc . a small part of me worries that this method will be a waste of money. but maybe it won't be. if i really think about it, it's no different than if the food came out while going no. 2. instead it's coming out by my mouth not ' throwing up' cause stomach acid will mess up the throat and cause an alser. no thank you . the only difference between the food i will swallow and the food i won't swallow is, one is healthy enough for my body to absorb while the other isn't. so my question is, is this method harmful? is it fine but weird? would it be considered an eating disorder? should i just cut junk food out of my life completely?",

"my eating disorder made my body look oddly shaped?. i m a couple of months into recovery and i m definitely weight restored now. i think i m doing well on my recovery journey overall i ve noticed when my ed was really bad, my body was oddly shaped. just storing fat in weird places, odd distribution of weight, etc. i never lost that much weight numerically but my body composition definitely changed. looking back now, i feel like i looked so much better before my ed i just looked unhealthy i see a lot of stuff about weight in general but not much info about body composition shape. my ed changed my shape much more noticeably than any number on the scale i knew i had to change as my body began to shut down on me internally and my health dramatically suffered. i m doing much better energetically health wise mentally, so grateful for that i suffered from atypical anorexia, turned bulimia, binge restrict cycling on off for over a year",

"sharing my experience with you all tw . hi just found this sub and figured i d post once a day to share my experiences going from orthorexia to anorexia to bulimia to anorexia to bed, i still struggle daily with the little things but i d like to say my mindset is almost fully recovered. despite intrusive thoughts and a disordered environment i ll start today off with an experience of mine that is shared by many, how i began recovering from it, and how i continue to recover from it. eating disorders are processes that take time, there is no quick fix, and that s the reality. one thing a lot of us with eating disorders seem to relate to is our relationship with food as children. whether our parents were super health obsessed or the complete opposite, most times that ends up with children with complications relationships with food. in my case, my mother was a huge advocate for weight watchers and, growing up, most of my childhood snacks were weight watchers brand. despite being a very athletic and healthy kid . this, of course, took a toll on me when i discovered that other kids my age were not being fed these things, so any time i came across normal food, i would destroy that shit. it still affects me today, since i am a minor living with this same parent who still obsesses over her food intake and how much sugar or fat we are all eating as a family, despite pretty much all of her kids developing extreme forms of disordered eating. one of my many extremes was when i went keto at the ripe age of eleven. i am seventeen now, and though i am a huge advocate for weightlifting, i no longer obsess over my food intake in any form. after going through the many eating disorders for roughly six years, someone asked me why i was weighing my food at a family reunion, and i told them why. that is when it clicked how ridiculous my eating habits were. that was my first step to recovery, discussing my disordered habits out loud. i find that discussing your traumas with professionals helps you to understand that, though these tendencies are pretty insane, it s not your fault and you are very much not alone. that is why i am posting on this sub today, because i know a lot of us on here don t have access to professionals like others. so please, use the comments of this post to talk about your habits, if you may find that to be, in any way, of comfort or help. i encourage you all to reach out to professionals, if possible. thank you for reading, friends ",

"healthier meals and workouts trigger relapses. disclaimer: i think healthy eating has more to do with the way you view food than what's actually in it, and you shouldn't define food by calories and whatnot. this post is not about that. i am also not asking for advice on how to get proper nutrition, this is simply about a mental block i have. a big part of recovering from my restrictive ed was baking and tasting the food i was making. from there on, i started practicing intuitive eating and letting myself grab a snack whenever i felt like it. when i choose what to have for dinner now, i think about what i feel like eating instead of limiting myself to certain foods or smaller sized portions. i mentally have no problem with this, but i've noticed that the lack of proper nutrition is affecting my body. i'm already a vegetarian, which also plays into this i take vitamins for that, though . i feel weaker than before even though i eat as much as i want to, which is a big bother when i engage in one of my passions dancing . i won't go into what my diet contains since it may be triggering to some people. i've been trying to change my diet in small ways in order to feel better physically but everytime i start thinking about what i eat, i end up falling back into my restrictive habits after a week or so. this is pretty distressing for me, and family etc have started pointing out that i'm ""eating unhealthy"", which makes the whole situation worse. it prevents me from being physically healthy because it makes it so much easier for me to relapse whenever i try to look over my diet. do any of you have advice on how to deal with improving my physical health mentally?",

"trying to help a friend. so i have a friend that has an eating disorder and i want to help but i don't know if i'm going about it the right way. she 22 has a terrible relationship with food; she doesn't really cook for herself nor will she make anything for herself that involves a stove. also, she thinks she needs to lose weight and is in her process of doing so, which is basically not eating anything nutritious for her body and very small meals. for example, her entire food intake in one day will usually be a protein bar and some yogurt. whenever what she ate for the day comes up in conversation, i don't know what to say and try not to say something like ""that's not enough"". but obviously, that's not the right response. i just don't know how to respond or handle it the situation. i get so frustrated because what she isn't doing is not good for her and i hate seeing her do this. except i know me being frustrated with her will not help. i know i can't tell her ""you need to eat more"" because that doesn't do anything. i don't know how to talk to her about this, i really think she needs to see a professional. what is the right way to handle this situation? we have known each other for about a year, she's younger than me and i'd say we have a relatively close relationship. i love cooking and i would love to help but is it better just to stay out of it? i have never met any of her other friends, we live in about an hour from each other so we don't see each other all the time; so i'm sure her other friends must know what's going on. i would hope at least... in the end, i guess my questions are: what is the best way to handle this situation? is it ok for me to tell her that she needs to see a therapist? whenever she brings up what she has eaten for the day, do i just move along with the conversation? when we hang out in person, is it better to bring it up then? i really want to help and and move her in the right direction, but i don't want to say something that will make the situation worse. all advise is appreciated i know i haven't handled everything the way i should have thus far, but i want to be a good friend to her.",

"sister in law has an eating disorder, need advice. hello everyone, over the past year, my fiance's family and i have slowly accepted the reality that her baby sister 17f has an eating disorder. it started with what we originally thought was gastritis and her complaining of stomach pains. as clues started coming together, her doctors began to realize that she was intentionally starving herself. as of now she is severely underweight and her doctors have said that she has little to no visceral fat surrounding her organs and her intestines are becoming necrotic. her parents feel absolute shame for letting her get this far in the disease and are desperate for help. my fiance's family lives in western europe while we are in the us, adding to our own sense of helplessness. their country is known for very blunt medical care, so after the doctors developed suspicion, they and the hospital staff immediately began accusing my sister in law of the disorder and treating her like a criminal selfish for having one while admitting her, which i believe pushed her deeper into the pro ana community. she's since deleted any of her whole body instagram pictures, body checks herself in the mirror constantly, purposely got a job at a brewery where she works 14 hour shifts at a time to have an excuse not to eat, always saying she's tired and going to her room without dinner, etc. we honestly don't know what to do as we have been getting conflicting advice, and we are desperate for answers. one of her primary doctors told her father that he's afraid to admit her to an ed rehab center as she'll be with many girls in the pro ana community that could potentially positively feedback on her ed. however, she's also going to turn 18 in a year and have complete medical autonomy, so they are running out of time to admit her to anything involuntarily. please tell me any stories, anecdotes, or advice on what to do next. her family asks me for help because i'm a doctor, but i've come to realize how poorly my medical education has prepped me on this subject. i am leaning towards telling them to admit her involuntarily to the ed rehab center as a last ditch effort, but i know this is an addiction and there are no fast or easy solutions. it's going to be a long wild ride, one way or another.",

"need advice for self recovery. hey guys. i'm looking for some help. last october, after becoming overweight over lockdown due to mental health issues, i began trying to lose some weight. most of my motivation to lose the weight came from persistent comments from my family and such; i was happy with my body. it wasn't really something i thought about. i don't know thought. one day i just snapped. i ended up losing a good amount, and once i hit my goal weight pre lockdown weight , i wasn't happy; i had to keep going. i've stayed mostly healthy in my methods, and haven't really gone past a safe deficit. however, i know my mindset isn't a healthy one. i'm obsessive in counting every calorie, exercising, and weighing. my weight loss hasn't been drastic, and im still in a 'healthy' bmi now, which has made it easy to hide from my parents. however in the past few months, i've started seeing an endocrinologist who im seeing once every three months. today was my second visit, and my doctor expressed concern with it, saying that if this trend has continued by my next visit to her in three months she'll consider referring me to a nutritionist. this means that my weight loss is no longer something i can hide behind, which terrifies me. i'm not happy with my body yet, but i have no other choice but to try and recover. i don't want to but there's not really another choice. i'm worried if i'm referred to a nutritionist i'll be forced to stop being vegan my whole family is vegan for ethical reasons , or something so i would really love to avoid having to go to one. i'm so worried and i don't want to stop losing but i need to recover. do any of you guys have advice for self recovery and getting out of the ""not sick enough"" mindset and pursuing recovery? how do i get my ""goal weight"" out of my mind and try to get over this",

"partner blames me for not hating his body as much as he hates it. i think my boyfriend is struggling with food. i myself am recovering from an ed that i struggled with for almost a decade. i feel i have gotten very far in my recovery. a couple years ago, i started a relationship with my current boyfriend. he was skinny. he did eat a lot and mostly fast food , but because of financial reasons, food was not always available. i think he managed to eat a lot at times and not gain weight, simply because he sometimes had to skip meals because he had no money for food. since we have been living together, there is always food available, because my financial situation is quite good. he now has access to a filled pantry, fridge, freezer, snacks and regular meals. he also works from home now, instead of cycling to different locations each day. over the last years, he has gained weight he still has a healthy weight that he now wants to lose. i don't object to this. however, he really hates his body now. he doesn't even want to be intimate any more because of his looks. he tells me he considers taking medication for adhd because it makes him lose his appetite. he doesn't have adhd though. he says things like only drinkint vinegar for a day, or vomiting after every meal, or eating rotten food or throwing out perfectly fine food. i recognise all of this. when i was deep in my ed, i had all these thoughts over and over again. i took pills, threw away food.... i understand him. the point is that he says i dont understand him and that nobody understands him. recently, he became more hostile to me. suddenly i and my family are the reason that he is gaining weight and we are his enemy. i cook him food, because that's how we decided to divide chores between us. during the years that we are together, i have been able to maintain the same weight. last week we went to a family get together. there were fries, but it was a buffet style meal so no one was forced to eat something they didn't like. he ate fries, a lot of fries. when we got home, he suddenly started blaming my family and i that he ate fries. he said that i didn't support him, that i let him eat fries even when i knew he didn't want to. personally, that fact that he ate fries wasnt even on my mind. and i definitely wasnt going to tell him what he could and could not eat in public, in front of my family. i think that is humiliating, and i wouldnt want to humiliate him in front of my family. he now says that's just an excuse i made up. he says that i should police his food if i care about him and our relationship. while i feel that a middle age can assemble a meal from a buffet and make the decisions he wants to make. i dont want to be the food police, because i know how much that hurt me in the past. i dont want to push an extreme diet on him, because i know it does not work in the long term. i dont want to support his disorder behaviour because i know how damaging it is and how hard it is to recover. i understands he doesn't like the weight gain, but i want to help him in a healty way. whereas he thinks i dont support him, if i dont hate his body as much as he does or if i dont force a restrictive food intake upon him. thruth is, i love his body he even threatened to leave me for this. which seems so silly to me, because we worked out way bigger issues in the past money, kids, family, religious and cultural differences . i love him so so much and i dont want this to break us up, but i am desperate because i am getting a lot of hate from him now too. does anybody know what i can do to help him? has anyone been in his position who can offer advice?",

"what is my friend suffering from and how can i help her. hi there i m seeking for help and advice on reddit as a very close friend of mine seems to be suffering from an eating disorder and it worries me a lot. so i ve known her since she was 11 yo and back then she had a super healthy relationship with food and a healthy weight. fast forward to when she turned 16 she started having digestive complications and extremely painful cramps when she ate fibrous foods. she went to the er and she did many tests ibs, crohn, etc but they were all negative . so she reduced her intake of fibrous foods but still ate a little bit of everything, she didn t lose weight. however, 6 years ago she met this gym addict guy and started going to the gym regularly. i didn t see her much at that time because we studied in different countries and when i saw her a year later i was stoked she lost so much weight i almost didn t recognise her. we were going out for dinner but she didn t drink anything, and ate barely nothing because all the foods offered were too painful to digest . apparently she had extremely painful cramps every time she ate something she couldn t digest, and this involves what seems to be 99 of the food: pretty much every fruit, veggies, cereals, meat, fish, dairies, etc. but she still didn t get diagnosed a digestive disorder. now since that time we met i ve seen her every 3 months: the strain she puts on her body is insane. i told me she last had her period 3 years ago she s obviously really underweight, but she goes to the gym every day for 2 to 4 hours despite her body being so fragile. i really thought she was genuine about the intestinal cramps so i started helping her map the foods she could actually eat and she saw a dietician which was not helpful at all they weighed her and said she was on the upper limit of healthy fat percentage for women . like wtf she s only bones and muscles, but she now told me for the first time that she didn t see herself weighing more, where would more weight go she would look so bloated . she let a few sentences like this slip by accident in our conversations when we traveled i really enjoy wearing xxxs clothing yoghurt doesn t hurt my stomach but it makes me gain weight like crazy i can t have too much of it or we didn t walk much this weekend i ll have to workout to make up for it when i get back home. now i m pretty sure she has an ed but which one? and also how could i help her? i m the only one she talks to about her eating issues because she says i m the only one who understands. i don t think she realises she s suffering from something more than a purely digestive issue. she also would never go to see a psychiatrist we come from village where people still believe only crazy persons consult them. she lives with her mom which is extremely toxic and controlling and just bullies her into eating more saying things like you re so skinny you re gonna break just stop complaining and eat already etc so how do i help her and get her to realise she needs support for her mental health without breaking our trust and friendship?",

"in your opinion, does it sound possible i have an eating disorder?. i am a 25 year old male and always struggled with my weight. i lost a lot of weight a few years ago, and try to obsessively count calories to make sure i do not exceed the recommended daily intake. occasionally i slip up, and gain some weight not much , and then i beat myself up over it. i can t stand gaining weight, it makes me feel like my life is falling apart. currently i am a healthy weight. usually i try to restrict what i will eat, and when i do gain weight, i restrict my calorie intake quite a lot. my friends have told me before i can calm down and have a beer or slice of pizza since i m arguably the skinniest of all of them, but i tell them i can t. my fianc tells me to stop beating myself up over it, and tries to adjust what we eat is available based on my calorie intake. when i do slip up, i find myself snacking more and not feeling satisfied. currently i am somewhat in this phase, and it usually occurs out of boredom. i apologize for the long post. if anyone could give advice if they think i have some sort of an eating disorder, that would be great unfortunately, there is a lack of discussion about body image and men, as well as males having eating disorders.",

"boyfriend commenting on weight gain. my boyfriend and i both have had bulimia on and off since we were in middle school. i started working remotely recently and gained a bit of weight, not overweight though. i have depression and working from home has been a problem for me, so i have been eating a bit more.at the time i was doing well with the eating disorder i started to notice my boyfriend stopped commenting on how great my body looked, but would say things like you look better in response to me recently starting to diet workout or you look fine when i would ask how i look. im probably being sensitive due to low self esteem, but i feel badly about the way he words things. i ve asked him if he would stop saying i look better . hearing that word makes me feel like i need to be bulimic again, because what i m doing isn t making me look good enough. he let it slip a few weeks ago and immediately backtracked, but i immediately teared up. he responded by getting angry, saying he is trying to be supportive. he angrily said something that is still really upsetting me, you need to stop throwing up, ordering ice cream, and get to the gym . this really upset me because i rarely order ice cream anymore and was working on being healthier by going on walks daily i had gotten ice cream one within the past 2 weeks . i am now going to the gym but cannot stop thinking about what he said, and definitely have started my ed again. am i being overly sensitive? i m not sure what to do, i just know i feel really badly. i want to get back on track, but i can t stop focusing on the possibility that he really wants me to lose weight.",

"my ed story wanting recovery advice. hi everyone : i've been a silent reader who has browsed reddit, specifically ed forums for years, but have never posted. today i woke up feeling absolutely gutted, so i decided to make an account and write this post in hopes of getting some kind of help and guidance. i don't have anyone in my life to talk to that understands what i'm going through. for some background, i'm a 23 year old female. growing up, i never thought about weight. while in high school, i was naturally on the thinner side. i didn't have any eating struggles, i was just a taller kid with a quick metabolism and my parents always fed me healthy and nutritious home cooked meals. i didn't eat much at a time, but i ate super often. my parents would get mad at me when we went out because i would never finish my food. i think it was after i graduated from high school that i became a full on foodie. i started really loving and appreciating food, would love to eat out with friends, try new places, etc. i started never leaving a plate empty. i am still in my weight range, not over, and to most people look a perfectly normal weight. however, after a few years of really loving food especially sweets and junk food , i dont know how, but one day it just hit me that i didnt look like i did before. like when i was younger and could wear low waist jeans without even realizing that they were low waist. my stomach wasnt flat anymore. when i gain weight, it goes straight into a tummy pouch, and to my face especially chin area . i decided to make a change, and started making sure i never ate after 7 pm, because i used to be a night eater. i started losing weight pretty fast. i wasn't restricting; in fact, sometimes i would eat as much as possible at 6:5 just to ensure i wouldn't be hungry at night. i still lost weight. i was super happy with how i was looking. but, after a certain point, the weight loss stopped. but something in me changed... and that wasn't good enough. i somehow became obsessed with losing weight. thats when i started restricting myself. i would have a schedule. a starbucks iced coffee at 2 pm, should hold me until 6 pm, when i would then have a really tiny meal even using measuring tools to be able to count the calories in the olive oil used to grease the pan to make sure my calorie intake for the day was extremely low. i was able to do this for a while, and i would lose weight every single day. i became the weight i wanted and i was somewhat happy with how i looked. but after i reached that weight, i was able to maintain the lifestyle for a while at first... but then it started getting really hard. i ended up getting into a restrict binge cycle. i would have the extremely low number of calories for a few days, and then i would end up being so so hungry, that i would transition into a full blown binge. i couldn't take the hunger anymore and would eat everything in sight. instead of just eating to a point where i got full, i would eat until i was super stuffed and felt sick. while i was restricting i would make lists while super hungry at night, to fantasize about what i could eat on a cheat day. during a binge i would want to give myself everything i ever wanted on that list, in hopes that i would get over the craving and do better tomorrow. my body was so hungry that i wanted everything, and i was in an all or nothing mindset; i already ruined everything so might as well get the most food out of it. the next day i would be so upset that i binged, that i would restrict to make up for it. then i would get super hungry from restricting, and then binge again. the cycle never stopped. i would be laying in bed in so much pain. i remember only having fruit one day and then waking up in the middle of the night sweating, crying, feeling extremely dizzy and faint, having intense stomach pain and feeling very nauseous. i was in so much pain that i didnt even feel hungry because too much was going on. i thought i could die. i got up and crawled to the kitchen and force fed myself a banana, struggling to swallow but trying so hard so that i wouldn't pass out. there were a lot of times like this. there was so much mental pain and physical suffering. no one really knew or could tell, because since i was in the binge cycle, my weight looked normal due to the ""balance."" time went on, and i ended up trying to continue what i had before, but i would keep failing at my restriction. i wouldn't eat the entire day, but then 1 pm would hit and i would fall into a binge. i would try to make up for it the next day, not eating throughout the day because i thought id be able to make it, but then the same thing would happen. restriction wasnt making it through the day anymore, just constant binging. this has been going on for 3 4 years. i always had the dream of getting back to the same lower weight, and that once i would restrict enough to get there, i could focus on getting healthy and eating normally... but only once i got there. well, i was never able to get there again. fast forward to now, my eating is still not normal. whether its a binge or a restrict, i've still not recovered. i started getting intense dizzy spells a few weeks ago. it was really scary. i saw a doctor and we did a few tests and saw that my blood sugar was low. i did some research, and it seems like its something that can happen and be dangerous with eating disorders. i decided i wanted to make a change. instead of doing extremes, like binging or restricting, i decided to try and eat a normal amount. i will be honest with you guys, im not doing complete miracle work; im still restricting a bit. however, not like before. the reason is because i am still wanting to lose weight. nothing extreme, but i want to. instead of the super restricted number of calories a day, im having at least double of that. i will be honest; i still go to bed hungry a lot. but i tell myself im healing and its a great start so i ignore that. i wasnt active during my issues in the past; i spent most days at home working on the computer. i started getting up every morning and going on 2 4 mile walks. i thought that this new lifestyle change would be amazing for me, and that i would instantly lose weight after stopping what became a 99 of the time binge. the scale had showed a small amount of progress in the beginning, three weeks ago, pretty quickly. then, it completely stopped. i have been stuck at the same weight ever since then. it is making me go insane. it is making me want to relapse. i keep telling myself just restrict, get your summer body fast, take all the pictures and wear all the outfits and do all of the things you want, and then start healing. i know mentally i shouldn't, but i am really really distraught. the weight im at shouldn't be my bodies natural weight, because its still the weight that i would have while i was binging. i wake up every morning and check the scale and start crying. if a couple of pounds is the only difference, why not enjoy binges? why am i walking everyday, eating super clean and healthy, and working so hard for nothing? it feels useless. im writing this post as a last resort because im wondering if anyone knows why i am still going to bed hungry, but eating clean and a more normal amount, getting out there and exercising, but still not losing weight. i appreciate any help, im feeling really desperate right now. side note; is it normal that now during recovery, if i don't eat for three hours between meals my body starts getting light headed and feeling like its going to shut down? it really scares me and triggers anxiety attacks. i dont know why my body has such an intense reaction to going without food for what i would assume are normal periods of time, especially now that im apparently doing better.",
"how do i help my partner without upsetting them. my partner we are both late 2 s has previously had an eating disorder that was really bad before we met. now that i've proposed, my partner is saying she wants to go on a diet but in a healthy way staying around a healthy minimum calories a day. today i made the mistake of asking how many calories she had before i went to bed and when she said a quarter of the minimum i said multiple times that she needs to eat and as you may guess we got into an hour long fight where she told me that i've upset her so much that she is no longer hungry. what would you want? what would you want a partner to do. i love her, i want to marry her. i'm also nervous and scared that she will hurt herself. i take full responsibility for not handling this well and thats why im asking, what should i do? also sorry for the numbers. i'm not trying to upset anyone just looking for real advice.",
"i am extremely worried about my friend who seems to be struggling with anorexia. throwaway bc i dont want to my friend to find out about this post i don't know how to write this down or how to put it into words, because i am just unsure on how i should be approaching the situation, or if it's even the right thing for me to be doing what i'm doing right now i know that sounds weird, but i will explain it later so as the title says, one of my friends seems to be suffering from an eating disorder. to give some background, i've known this person since the beginning of our freshman year, and although we didn't talk that often, we still were able to get along pretty well. after freshman year, while we weren't able to hang out because of quarantine, we still kept in touch with each other and eventually managed to become closer friends with each other. as of now, we are both upcoming seniors who are about to enter our last year of high school, and honestly i am so glad to have met him as i really care about him a lot, which is why i am even making this post to begin with. while we aren't hanging out that often during the summer, since even though we go to the same school, we mostly just text each other, we still keep in contact with each we or atleast i care for the both of us. now onto the main issue. let me state that i have only just started to learn about this in the clearest detail that i have been recenty given. while he has previously mentioned it as an offshoot comment that he has had a type of eating disorder, i assumed that he had gotten better, but it seems to me that it might not be the case. lately, he's been showing off some worrying behavior keep in mind this is happening online because we havent been hanging out lately and i decided to reach out to him about it. and after he talked to me about, i tried to cheer him up about it, and even thought i tried to make things better by being positive, internally i felt like i was going to breakdown from how i was supposed to even take in the information. i can't really explain exactly what it is that he said to me because some of it is too personal, but eitherway, the best way for me to show what it is that he said, is for me to quote some of the things that he said to me: ""basically, my mom was telling me that i need to eat more. which is already a huge nope ."" ""....i had literally been looking up ""how to make yourself vomit"" less than 1 minutes before the conversation."" conversation was with their parents about their anorexia ""i hold myself to very strict rules and ive kind of relapsed into my ed but i really cant help it, its safe to me"" ""im just being pushed over the edge and sounding dumb"" ""...acknowledgement that my behavior is unhealthy but its normal and safe and its the only thing i can control and food is absolutely fucking terrifying"" 'im okay with eating shit i find on the streets because theres a chance i'll get sick from it, but food made with love? all i can think about is calories for both cases, how much i'll have to exercise to work it off, if i can chew and spit it somewhere discreet... but thats control and its healthy only for me."" when i got these messages, i was just overall unsure on how to feel about all of this, and i really do want to help my friend out in whatever way possible, but i don't even know what steps to take at all, or how i should approach him about it, because at the moment that they told me this, my only reaction as i previously said was just to comfort him as i didnt know what else i could even do. the reason i said at the beginning of the post that i didn't know if i should even be reaching out was because i fear that he's going to get mad at me for trying to reach out to people for seeking out help that he could use. i don't know why, but i just sense that he would be not only upset at me for doing this, but would just overall not want to be friends with me anymore, since i know it must""ve been difficult for him to share what he's been going throught to me. but still, even if he might get upset over this, i still want to reach out to get him help because and the end of the day, i want him to get better and i know it's not going yo be easy, but taking steps to helping out is the least i can do",
"social anxiety paired with an ed is so fucked up. i just picked my bf up from work i'm with the same company and while we were there, a coworker commented on my weight. he said i'd lost weight and i make a point in not even owning a scale so numbers can't trigger me. he meant it in a positive way, but now i'm kinda stuck in the mentality of doing well by not eating. i've been slacking with eating because i'm in the middle of pretty important exams and wanted to put all my energy into studying. so i guess that's why i lost some weight, but it can't be a lot. so now my bf just asked me if i wanted to have dinner with him. i said yes as i haven't eaten all day. but then he said we'd have to go grocery shopping in order to have enough food for both of us. and i immediately panicked. grocery stores are basically my nemesis. for one, there's all this triggering food everywhere, then there are people who move slow or block lanes which causes me panic attacks mostly when i'm already stressed and then there's the issue of me constantly thinking everyone's judging me for buying food. i'm chubby after all and my head is still convinced that everyone thinks badly of fat people who buy or eat food in public. you see, it's a fucking downward spiral. today is a day i'm 1 sure will cause a panic attack if i go to the store. so now i told my bf i don't want to eat. he's currently in the kitchen cooking for himself and i'll just wait for lunch at school tomorrow i guess. and i hate myself for being like this. i just wanna cry and yell and i don't even know. why do i have to be this fucked up. i was on such a good track, not counting calories anymore and eating intuitively and everything. but the second i'm stressed i'm going right fucking back... does anyone have a plan to avoid this? basically, how do i prevent it from getting this bad?",
"is that a bulimia nervosa?. i have been suffering from an eating disorder for 6 years but i can't name them. it is like i pig out a few times a week and then i try to stick to a restrictive diet and i work out a lot in mornings i run and in evenings i ride a bike , but i don't throw up bcs i can't. i have tried many many times and i have never managed. this disorder makes me exhausted. i hate myself, i hate looking in a mirror, i hate eating, but i can't stop. i just fucking can't. i can't switch to an another thing until i am extremely full and i can barely move. because of excessive work outs, i'm not obese or anything, but i crave to lose some weight. it destroys my life and i can't help myself... i don't know whether it is a bulimia or binge eating and i would be grateful if you guys helped me name this shit and give some advice.",
"how to force myself to eat. i m struggling a lot with my eating. i ve always had a hard time eating a lot of calories in a day, and been very skinny my whole life as a result. in 2 19 2 21 i for whatever reason gained a bigger appetite. i was able to eat three meals and graze on snacks throughout the day, and got up to a more healthy weight this year has been very stressful for me. lot of life changed and stressful events in general. i ve gone back to eating very little, and lost weight as a result. my friends and family are concerned about my weight loss. i m a 21 y o male if that s relevant. i know what weight i need to be but it s really hard to get there. i have some safe foods i can consistently eat but they aren t always available. i think i need to just force myself to eat food that i have in the house even if it isn t safe but it s so hard for me. i eat a few bites and feel full and feel like if i eat anymore im gonna throw up. sometimes i do actually throw up. any tips on how to get past this? if i lose too much more weight i might need to check myself into ed rehab or something. im really worried because i have a lot going on in july and august and having to go to rehab would be a huge stressed on top of everything else. any help is appreciated : ",

"how can i break free of what my mom instilled in me?. warning this is my safe zone so please don't get mad at me for anything i say here basically, my mom struggled with her weight growing up, and it carried out into her adulthood especially after having kids. it also did not pair well with my father being fatphobic, only having been with her from the beginning because she was skinny at the time, and constantly trying to get her to lose the weight. meanwhile, after i 17f started to grow up, i was a fairly skinny kid, but my mom had begun to tell me things like ""don't ever get fat"", ""don't ever gain weight, you'll hate it so much"", etc. she would look at herself in the mirror and say ""god i'm so fat"", and when my sister got older and started to put on a little weight, she would say things to me like ""have you seen your sister?"". it also didn't pair well with my fatphobic father, who, never said anything to my face about weight, but would make comments about my sisters dog that was quite on the larger side, saying very disparaging things about the dog simply because she was fat. i pretty much grew up being influenced by my mothers hatrid for her own body, and it caused me to develop a pretty terrible fear of gaining weight, which isn't surprising. however, once i grew up and wasn't a kid anymore and couldn't eat whatever i wanted, i stopped eating as much as to not gain any weight. but, my mom didn't like that. she'd tell me i didn't eat enough etc which i appreciate her looking out for me. but to this day i still have an irrational fear of gaining weight, not because i think it looks bad on other people, but because my mother instilled this fear in me that i just can't shake; and i feel terrible about it everyday, because i understand with every inch of my body that someone's body type and shape should not be my own fear, and it's pretty damn disrespectful for me to say that. but on a real note, on a, please i beg for this to be a safe space note, i just don't know what to do. i've never been annoying and pushy about my eating disorder, rubbing it in peoples faces that i don't eat and that i think putting on weight looks bad, i keep to myself. but how can i get rid of this fear? do i just need therapy?",

i'm so confused. i'm a teenaged girl adding this information incase it affects any advice for the past few years i've found i'm just not hungry anymore. as i kid i would eat anything and everything at any time but i barely remeber those days anymore. it didn't start off too bad at first but it's gotten worse and worse over the years. then a couple months back there was a mager change in my home life and it got a whole lot worse. for weeks i could barely eat to the point even my family members noticed when they never have before. its worth noting that i deal with a lot of anxiety and my home situation and also another situation it was a good thing just different were making me anxious. things got slightly better after a couple months but still a lot worse then it was before. i can't go to my family about this because they will think i'm anorexic. but the thing is i am not. i know i'm not because i don't care that much about my weight and how i look. i have a therepist and i'm thinking of getting her input before i go to my family because i recognise i need help and they might understand better with a professional opinion. triggers details on what it's like. most of the time i'm genuinely not hungry and can't stand to even think of food. when i have to eat it it makes me feel so sick. sometimes i get really really hungry and there's literally no amount of food i can eat that will fill me up but eventually it will just fade and i'm not hungry again i find it easier to eat junk food then healthy food foods have been kinda split into two groups in my mind. a select few comfort foods i can eat without too much bother. foods that make me gag to even think about eating even when i'm starving. and the ones in between that depending on how bad it is i may or may not be able to eat i've picked up some bad habbits to avoid this getting discovered. mainly dumping food when i'm able so i can eat semi normally when people are watching. i try to avoid skipping meals and if i have to dump something will substitute it for something easier usually some kind of bar that's easy to grab and i am able to eat but if i'm not hungry at all. which is often. i end up having to skip the meal. i also feel really sick if i eat a full meal that would be considered an appropriate amount for my age i'm pretty sure that's everything and i hope this makes sence and i don't sound like i'm trying to make an issue out of nothing because this is so weird i can't figure it out and i've really been struggling. any advice would be appreciated,

"my best friend is suffering from an eating disorder. how can i help?. hi i don't normally use reddit but i'm at a loss, so hopefully someone here will be able to offer some insight and help me. my best friend in the entire world let's call him eric is a gay male in his early twenties the relevancy to sharing this will come up later . we've known each other for an incredibly long time and have been basically inseparable. he has suffered with depression and anxiety for as long as i've known him. as we've blossomed into adulthood, we of course have had less time to hang out but still see each other once a month if not more. i can confidently say that they are my best friend and always will be. eric is a work a holic. he is currently in medical school and works insane hours where eating is not a priority as he is caring for other people. he has also been single for a very long time. we saw each other this weekend and i noticed that he wasn't himself when it came to eating, though, i chose not to bring it up as i figured he would bring this up to me if he felt it was necessary. i chalked it up as he was just not hungry. he has also lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. i was correct and he did in fact message me this morning and told me that he was suffering and needed to talk to someone about it but he didn't want me to respond with ""too much"" as he was working and didn't want to become overwhelmed. he told me that he knows he has developed a eating disorder. he expressed everything he was feeling and how if he missed a day at the gym he would start crying and if he started to count his calories for the day, it would make him throw up. he also mentioned that he feels like this is due to not having any male attention in his life. he has been single for probably 6 or 7 years. lastly, he mentioned that he knows he needs to see a therapist because it is getting worse by the day but he refuses to go. how do you not respond to that? my heart broke for him. i responded with a short, comforting message and explained that if he felt this way that we should get him help and that i'd be happy to look up therapists covered by his insurance. i also typed up a long message in my notes which i shared with him and told him not to look at it until after work. he didn't look at it. when i asked him if he had, he said that he was fine and that he appreciated everything but he was just stressed and explained that he will be okay. i don't mind that i took the time to write this message up, i'm just scared for my friend and want to help him. as someone who has helped this person through their depressive battles, has seen them at their worst and know how bad it can get, i really fear for his mental health. i want to respect his wishes not to talk about it anymore, but at the same time i feel like a terrible friend not doing anything... at the same time, what can i do? i feel like him reaching out to me was a cry for help and i don't want to insist that we talk about what is happening and get him help as i fear that it will only overwhelm him and he wont come to me in the future if and when this issue grows more severe. i want him to feel comfortable coming to me as i know how scary this world can be when you don't have someone. if someone here has gone through this and has some advice for what i can do for my friend, i would greatly appreciate any advice i can get. thank you.",
"gerd caused my weight loss. months ago, i went to the gastroenterologist for stomach pain and acid reflux and was diagnosed with gerd.. it s a digestive disease in which stomach acid or bile irritates the food pipe lining.. and i was also diagnosed with barrett s esophagus which is really early for my age.. female college student the acid has basically burned the lining my esophagus. it s typically found in older white males.. i lost many pounds since then. i was fine with that though, since i was overweight and insecure. i stopped eating as much because i was worried it would make me feel sick. my prescription medicine i was taking made me throw up every morning and i wasn t eating a thing i would throw up daily. i get worried i ll get esophageal cancer by the time i m old, but recently i started to realize that my hair has been falling out significantly and thinning and i think this is because of the weight loss i need to stop being paranoid. since then, ive gotten better. i slowly have found foods that don t bother me so much. but as i put on weight again even small amounts i feel bad about my body.. what do i do..? i need to start eating again for my own health.",

"not sure if i have an ed. i ll give some context in the body here, but i want to preface with the fact that ed help where i live is basically nonexistent unless you are visibly very ill. i m 18, 5 3 and weigh a healthy weight. i ve struggled with body image issues for a few years, and i d say i spend upward of 2 3 hours per day staring at my body in mirrors, cameras and any other reflective surfaces. about 9 months ago i started checking calories on things and avoiding them if they re not small numbers. i was slightly overweight at that point. in january of 2 22 i decided i wanted to be skinnier, that was my goal. i hated everything about my body. so i started going to the gym 5x a week consistently and basically dropped all junk food, dropping my calories to a number that is sustainable but far less than what i was eating prior. between then and now, i ve tried on several occasions to purge but for some reason i cannot vomit, it just doesn t work. my body won t eject vomit. i just gag aggressively. i still try though. fast forward to today, i have dropped some weight and now am considered a healthy weight. i still think i look the same as i used to and i still am not happy with how i look. the time i spend looking at my appearance and judging each feature and how clothes look on me has increased over time. now food is where i get concerned. i still eat, but i feel guilty about it unless it s something like raw fruit or veggies in small quantities. i don t like family events because i m expected to eat more than what i am comfortable eating in front of everyone. i am scared to eat up to my calorie expectation for the day, or go over, because i am absolutely terrified of gaining weight again. i genuinely think i d do something bad if i gained again. if any individual food item is over a small number of calories i get very iffy about eating it, and my meals usually don t exceed about a sixth of my daily intake. i still exercise 4 5 times per week as well. i m just so concerned bc this stuff takes up well over half of my waking thoughts. family are concerned about me and think i look sick even though i don t have any bones protruding besides hips and collarbones .",

"how do i go back to normal eating drinking? afraid of drinking water . in march 2 21, i was at my heaviest weight ever. i realized that i needed to start a weight loss journey, so i started eating healthier and exercising a little. after a while, though, i got obsessed with seeing progress on the scale and cared less about how easy it would be to maintain the process. around four months into my weight loss journey july 2 21 , i developed a very weird eating schedule. i would continue drinking the recommended daily amount of water, but i would stop drinking water and stop eating around the late afternoon because i noticed that this helped give me the best numbers on the scale when i weighed myself at night or in the morning. it's stupid because i know that i am still consuming the same amount of food and water everyday, but i was obsessed with seeing a smaller number on the scale. i've more or less stuck to this pattern of not eating drinking after mid afternoon for the past year, minus a few exceptions here and there. every single time that i eat drink outside of that time frame, i notice that i weigh much more the next day, and it discourages me from doing so again. i tried to go back to a regular eating schedule for a week, and i ended up gaining some weight, which scared me away from trying again. i hope this is the correct subreddit for asking this: how do i get back to eating drinking normally? i feel like i have mental blocks that are nearly impossible to get over that are preventing me from doing so.",

"i m afraid to admit that my eating disorder is getting worse. please be mindful trigger warning . this is a vent for advice before we jump into this, i d like to note that i do go to therapy and this cycle has just gotten bad again. i f19 have been surrounded by the idea of losing weight and such since a young age. i ve always noticed that i didn t run as fast as the other kids, and i was always the last to stand up off the carpet during lessons in fear i d bump into someone. in middle school, i would abuse the family tread mill by going and walking miles a day on it and fixating on my diet. in high school, food guilt and anxiety hit an all time high. college has rolled around and i manage a decent relationship, nothing too impressive. here lies the issue, i ve come home from college. i ve re entered my toxic household, along with my recently disabled mother. i m grasping for control. i m in denial that it s getting bad again. i recognize it. eating once day, then doing a labor intensive job is not the move. but i feel powerful. like this diet, every piece of food or drink, i can control. i can t control the things in my life or the people around me, but i can control this. i know how much i eat, when i eat it, and nearly the amount of bites. but with my power comes a fault. i m scared again. i m scared of sodas, and sweets that i can t control. i m scared of 2 helpings of dinner, and i m always looking in the mirror for the weight. i m scared all the time. i also feel tremendous guilt. i feel guilt after every meal if it i don t control the ingredients. i work in a restaurant and we get free meals on sunday. i ve gone as far as watching the cooks prepare my food so it doesn t haven t anything i m not anticipating on. i know i ll fall faster down the rabbit hole if i don t get this under control, but god am i afraid to admit that its getting bad again.",
"what s going on with me. hey this is actually my first ever comment on this app and i joined it just for the reason to meet other people like me and to see how they manage to, well, stay alive. i found out about arfid a couple years ago but i haven t done anything about it because i have crippling anxiety and acting upon all of this makes it real and it can be super scary. i haven t weighed myself in the past few days but i m sure i m 12 lb or probably even lower at this point. i basically eat like a 7 year old at his friends birthday party except for pizza and mac and cheese i hate melted cheese and up until about 2 months ago i was doing fine, until i fainted and busted my head open and had to get 6 staples. the doctors told me nothing was wrong with my head or my blood and they just sent me home. about two weeks ago i was in dc and passed out in a museum and all they said was i had low blood sugar so they gave me juice and sent me on my way. fast forward to yesterday where i woke up feeling pretty lightheaded, still went to work and felt like i was gonna pass out so my stupid ass drove myself home when i shouldn t have but i made it home safely. i took a nap and when i woke up i felt so much worse so my gf had our neighbor take me to the hospital because she was too worked up and again they told me my blood was fine and they sent me home again. this morning i feel ok but still lightheaded but i need to figure out how i can get more nutrients into my diet when i am incapable of swallowing things that don t taste good to me which is pretty much everything. i m pretty much a carnivore that eats carbs and sweets and it s finally taking its toll on me and i don t know what to do. i know i need help but i don t know exactly what kind and i m pretty scared tbh i just want to be a normal person. i more than likely should ve admitted myself for an impatient program somewhere years ago but i ve learned as of recently i don t have any insurance and i m actively working on getting some. this isn t my whole story so if anyone has any questions feel free to ask and i ll be more than happy to answer we re all in this together. stay strong j dawg",
"tw for everything, kinda tmi, digestive problems. female,24. so i had an ed and an anxiety disorder in high school and recovered well enough... so far so good. but a couple of years after that i was under a ton of stress, working weird hours and traveling a ton, which made me burn out, leading up to an evening when i called in sick everywhere and got stoned with a couple of friends. being very tired, it literally took three puffs to turn me into a panicked blob, lying still on the floor i have memories of that, only remember the panic, but my friend used the word catatonic and that was a very traumatic experience... some days after that i hadn't ben eating enough, but nothing too extreme i got severe diarrhea and something like a constant panic attack. i stopped going out completely for fear of sh tting myself and or dying of fear and embarrassment. i've been getting better, i go to work and do fun stuff sometimes with a lot of anxiety tho . it's been 2 years, multiple diets to rule out food sensitivities, a ton of doctors, multiple meds, including, but not limited to: escitalopram, lamotrigine severe allergic reaction , sertraline, flupentixol, hydroxyzine and multiple herbal stuff. i take imodium almost daily, lately i've been taking 2 a day. according to all doctors so far, nothing is wrong with me, but the whole digestive shabang has been triggering me a lot i've been able to withstand so far but i've slowly but consistently been gaining weight mostly due to the meds for a while now, so it might all go to sh t soon, no pun intended. i guess my question is, has anyone experienced something similar, how did you deal with it? tldr: two years into recovery i got uncontrollable diarrhea, anxiety and depression after a bit of drug abuse . anyone else? how do you deal with it?

"still struggling with recovery, afraid of relapsing. i have no idea where i am in my ed journey right now. i struggled with anorexia for about one year and started considering myself recovering a year and a half ago, which was when i eliminated all food restrictions the last to go was intermittent fasting . i ve gained weight since recovering, and a few months ago got a job as a receptionist for a gym. the latter was probably a mistake and while i love my job coworkers, it s only exacerbating the problem. this combined with the fact that i m leaving for a huge vacation in about a month where i think i may be proposed to has made me start to relapse into all of my old habits. i m stressed and can t recognize myself in the mirror anymore. i m getting new clothes for vacation as well which is impossible and anxiety inducing. this is something that s really hard to bring up with my family loved ones. my family usually only exacerbates the problem. my parter is endlessly supportive but i think that he doesn t understand the best ways to help me. does anyone have any advice on how to come to terms with weight gain after recovery fighting against relapsing? thank you so much in advance lt;3",

"how to stop thinking about food and snacking all the time?. tldr; eating is constantly on my mind, i can't go 1 minutes without thinking what i could eat now, have been feeling the effects on my back and knees of rapidly gaining weight. want to start losing it again by working out but also change this mentality of always wanting to stuff myself whenever i get the opportunity. sorry for the vague title but i just don't know how to put it shortly. i've been a sweettooth my whole life, i like treating my taste buds with a cake, a pain au chocolat, or anything sweet. it wasn't that much of a problem in my previous years because i was growing, and i grew to be quite tall so i could eat back then without a lot of consequences to my weight. soon after i stopped growing, the pandemic dropped which was a good thing for me because when i go outside and ride my bike to school, i usually pass a bakery and then i can't for the life of me ride past it without stopping for something sweet, that usually has a lot of calories, like a doughnut, pain au chocolat, maybe a tarte. because of this and because the pandemic is starting to fade, or at least the mandates are non existent now except for in hospitals. i got quite a bit of weight in the past semester. i always tell myself at home to not stop at the bakery anymore every day, maybe once a week to treat myself but i always find myself stopping my bike and going in line to treat my taste buds once again. now this problem doesn't only occur when i'm riding my bike to my uni, but also at home. i'm studying for example but all i can think about is stuffing myself with food at times. this can be healthy food but also not so healthy food, i check the time every 1 minutes to see how close i am to lunch or dinner, even though i'm not that hungry. for now i'm overweight, but it doesn't really reflect on my body yet, except for my face which is getting a bit more fat and round, you can't really see my growing man boobies, my belly that is starting to become rounder too. this is mostly because i'm quite a tall and big built person in general, with broad shoulders and thick legs, which is a family trait lol. my goal is to stop this before it becomes a bigger problem, i already decided to work out and go back to my original weight, but i also want to battle the mental side of this problem and stop my binge eating. when there are snacks in house like a bag of chips, it's always finished on the same day it was bought. my family genes don't favour me with a good back, nearly everyone in my family has severe back problems, my height and weight make me vulnerable to these problems too. i'm already starting to feel more pain in my back on a daily basis, running and walking hurts my knees and hips. not only is this a problem to my body, but also financially, i spend like 12 a month, just on snacks. how can i change this mentality of constantly wanting to eat something?",

"what can i do to help my girlfriend recover?. i have been with my girlfriend for nearly 1 years and love her dearly. she has suffered from bulimia for the entirety of our relationship, plus a few years prior. i'm no stranger to the pathology of addiction and how difficult it is to overcome. i was an addict in the past and i have been surrounded by addicts my entire life. of course an eating disorder is different, but its a different manifestation of the same beast. through the years she has expressed a desire to recover but has never acted on it. i see her physical and mental health deteriorate in front of my eyes. it's extraordinarily difficult to watch someone i love destroy their body, mind, and soul on a daily basis. i'm a very understanding and rational person. i have never brought this topic to her with anything other than love, concern, and compassion. unfortunately i'm beginning to believe i will have to end the relationship. the truth of the matter is that an addict will never get sober for anyone other than themselves not saying this negatively . i'd love to see her happy and healthy. we could live a long life together and raise children. with her current trajectory this future seems highly unlikely, if not impossible all together. some days i just want to tell her i love her, then leave and never come back. other days i want to stay by her side to support her possibly enabling her i suppose . is there anything i'm doing that seems counter effective? is there anything i should be doing that i'm not?",

"can i have an ed at 58?. i am a 58 year old, 5'9"" f. i currently weigh 127 pounds. for decades i weighed between 19 22 pounds. 6 years ago, i divorced my husband of 28.5 years and magically the extra weight began to come off. while married, i would binge eat and then restrict. i was addicted to fast food and sugar, an alcoholic, and a major restricter even though i was fat . the more calories i took in through alcohol, the less food i would eat. once i left the husband and alcohol behind, it was easy to restrict and lose weight. since i am in control of me now, i eat the way i want, or not. no one tells me what to do anymore. this newfound freedom has gotten me into a pickle. i am a professional chef and i work in the health field, and i look like a scarecrow. i give nutritional advice and prepare special beautiful healing food for people and can't manage to eat any of it myself. people tell me regularly that i am too thin. even people i don't know. i have also spent the last year tapering off of latuda, a medication for bipolar and anxiety that i had been taking for 6 1 2 years and didn't feel was benefitting me in any way. during the last six months of my taper, my ocd symptoms, which i didn't know were symptoms, i just thought i was bat shit crazy all of these years absolutely raged. i was crazy obsessed with mini bingeing. i would drive all over my area looking for just the right little whatever cakes, cookies, ice cream, lots of donuts and chips , purchase an armful of little goodies and then eat them in a certain order at a certain time, and yes, it was weird. once my brain returned to 'normal' after my taper and my ocd diagnosis, the weird thoughts about food and eating disappeared. except, for the restricting. i am willing to possibly gain five pounds, but it is too difficult and i am not up for it right now. to gain muscle, i need to increase portion size, and or frequency of meals, increase protein, and weight train. none of which i am willing to do right now, so i stay very thin. if i simply eat to gain weight, i will be putting on fat. i am not willing to do that. i also weigh myself every morning so that i know when to stop eating . i have an extremely difficult time eating my own cooking. i mostly eat sandwiches and cereal at home and pick my way through the day at work. one day a week, i try to overeat and will eat a healthy meal, or two, and some ice cream. today, i was determined to eat three times. i made a tasty gut healing fresh juice for everyone and drank some myself and later made a protein smoothie, which i also drank. i felt great and then, i noticed that i felt guilty for drinking the juice and the smoothie and was going to skip dinner because i didn't feel absolutely ravenous with hunger at dinner time. i was missing the light headedness and brain fog that i usually had. that concerned me. i have gone to my therapist. she is a very sweet food normy and doesn't know how to help me. the psychiatrist who i used to help me taper off of my meds wants me to have a ketamine infusion and then have an intense psilocybin drug trip followed by intense therapy. what? i don't know what to do. i try to ignore it and i can some days. on other days i see the seriousness of my situation and really worry. do i have an eating disorder or just disordered eating? i do not binge, purge, or have any odd food things, and i am not a teenager. what is going on with me?",

anyone find logging food triggering?. i know that recovery frequently involves logging food so that your team can have some data. i find this super triggering. if i look at the list and it seems like too much i ll restrict more and spend more time at the gym. if it seems like nothing i will maybe allow myself a bit more at a meal. my ed clearly has hijacked the idea of a food log. am i the only one? how can you combat this or get around it?,
in recovery. hello. i 24f have been in recent very for a few months. i had a pretty intense eating disorder but am luckily figuring my way out of it. one thing that has been bothering me though is i think i m noticing an increase in my self isolating because i ve been gaining weight. im at a pretty normal weight but it s just not what i m used to. i m scared of going out in public or meeting people because everyone will be so focused on my weight. does anyone have any tips on how to change my mindset. i don t want my weight to determine my self worth anymore. i would really like to be more confident.,

"my last all in approach lead to relapse, how do i find a middle ground?. around six months ago i used unrestricted eating to get me out of a binge cycle. it worked, but once the severe hunger cues subsided, the weight gain eventual sent me into several months of significant restriction only eating three days a week, with over three hours exercise on eating days . i m now making a second attempt at recovery but i know rapid weight gain will likely send me into the same loop yet again, so i don t think unrestricted eating is the best approach. often i ll still feel hungry sometimes mental, sometimes physical despite feeling physically distended full and i don t think it s good to continue to eat in that situation. has anyone had success with a more moderated approach to recovery? like trying to honour physical hunger but not eating when mentally hungry? still acknowledging it, but not giving in to it i m on the waitlist for therapy, it s been super difficult to find anyone who is taking new patients but i will eventual get in to have more professional input. i m just trying to find strategies to self manage in the meantime.",

"is wasting food in eating disorder recovery bad?. i don t like to waste food, but i really hate how preachy people get about food waste. as someone who has been in ed recovery for 5 years and nearly died from anorexia, i absolutely hate hearing from people about my food waste or being expected to always take my left overs. in my treatment for anorexia, i was forced to eat extreme quantities and since getting weight restored and healthy physically, i have struggled with binging on and off. it has gotten so much better, for instance i m certain in some binges i would eat nearly 4 times as much food as i would eat in a regular day and one thing that has helped me stop binging is throwing food away. for the most part, i try to make this a last resort because i want to get to a point where i can have a lot of really yummy snack food around and not feel afraid that i will binge on it and so i usually try that first, but sometimes it doesn t work and i think that it s better for me to have the freedom to know i can buy all of my favorite foods and if i start having overwhelmingly disordered self destructive thoughts, i can throw them out and buy them again when i feel like it so i don t feel compelled to eat everything in sight and then forbid myself from ever eating those foods again. i know this may seem dumb, but allowing myself to throw away food has allowed me to begin to create more balance with my relationship to food. and of course, if i can help it, i will buy smaller quantities of things, but so far, even though this is by no means an ideal fix, this has helped me a lot since i can eat a normal amount of the foods i like whenever i want.",

"i need help with recovery. i feel very vulnerable and i might be putting out to much information so i will try to stay vague. i'm and girl and i'm trying to recover from a ed. i'm not yet a teenager and i feel stupid for even starting to stop eating. to be one hundred percent honest everything seems like a blur. i think i started getting self conscious about 2 3 years ago. i don't remember when i stopped eating but i remember that in health class we watched a movie about a girl with anorexia. she was already ""skinny"" and then she stopped eating to get skinnier. i was bigger than her and i thought that if i want to be pretty i have to look like her and be that small. i think that's where it all started. the first few weeks one girl pointed out i was not eating lunch and that scared me. it scared me that if someone did something about it i would have to stop. i started getting up earlier than everyone else in my family so i could get ready sooner. i pretend to eat and would say that i did before they woke up. i have a older sibling who plays sports so i was home alone a lot. this gave me the opportunity to skip breakfast lunch and dinner. then everything came crashing down. my school has a system that tells you how much money your kid is spending on school lunch. my mom say that i had not bought lunch for like a month. the day she figured it out she called me down stairs and asked me about it. i lied. or, at least tried. i first told her that it was wrong then she caught me in that lie so i said that it wasn't that long. i told her about the girl in front of me who gave me snacks which was true but i don't think she believed me and i don't blame her. i lied to her. eventually i told her i was just not hungry which was partially true. of course she knows i need to eat so she got me a nutritional chocolate milk dirnk thing that is supposed to give you energy. for lunch she would pack me a bag of grapes. that's what i told her the girl in front of me gave me. i started off drinking the drink for a while but i wasn't getting skinnier so i stopped drinking the mix. i went in this rotation so i would not get caught. i would make one and put it in the fridge but leave the trash out so it looks like i drank it and the next day i would drink it and leave the cup out. i didn't get caught. my siblings sport came to a end and i started eating dinner again. so i skipped lunch. i would give my food out to the people around me and not have to worry about it. i still do that to this day. this is very hard for me to say because nobody, not even people who know about my starvation, know that when i want to be skinny but i have to eat i will make myself throw up. this is on rare occasions but is becoming more more frequent. i started counting calories recently and found i need to be eating more. i don't like the amount i eat but it feels good. today i have made the decision to change. i want to heal. i want my dream body but i want to work for it in a healthy way. that is main goal, to be skinny. i know it's going to take time and i have a lot of years to work on it but why not start now. i have done so much research but i can't find anything that quite fits what i'm going through. i know i'm not going to start eating and keep the weight off. actually i want to gain some weight but i want to lose fat. i know this is a bit unrealistic but i want abbs and i know i'm going to have to work for it. also i wear a mask to cover my face because i am self conscious. i want to stop caring but i just find myself so ugly. this might be a result of the desire of having a perfect body but i just thought i would throw this in here. so in summary i'm not yet a teen with a history of staving myself, from time to time binge eating, and making myself puke, who is a girl and i am wanting to get muscle in a healthy way and get a flat stomach. i think i want to stop calorie counting and focus on my health. if you have any advice or questions i will try my best to respond and take it to heart. i might have forgot somethings but i really need help. i'm not in the right mental state and i can't reach out to my parents or a therapist so if anyone can help that would be so appreciated. i'm sorry if this was offensive in anyway. i am not self diagnosing but i am just stating what is going on. thank you for reading and i hope we all find a way to heal. i'm really going to try to stick to it. thank you. lt;3",

"my girlfriend has an eating disorder, should i tell her mother?. me and my girlfriend have been dating for two years. i love her more than anyone and i care about her deeply. she has mentioned a few times casually in the past that she throws up her food when she eats too much or because she wanted to be thinner. she is aware that i don't like that she does that to herself and that i still find her attractive no matter what. she also mentioned that she intentionally threw up before one of our first dates together because she was worried about her appearance. she told me that her mother had confronted her on it in the past because she discovered that she could eat and not have to gain weight, but she continues to do it to this day. most recently she told me she does it because she doesn't like the feeling of food in her stomach but she likes to eat. i suspected that this was the case, but i didn't think that she would continue to do it that often. because she lives with her mother i thought that if i brought it up with her and suggested that my girlfriend see a psychiatrist or eating disorder specialist that she may have a better chance of getting the help she needs and receiving treatment. i've threatened to break up with her for continuing with her habits in the past but it seems that the problem is too far rooted for that to help. i even told her that i might tell her mother that she continues to vomit her food intentionally. she then briefly threatened me by saying that she would tell her mother something about me that i don't want her to know. after i somewhat talked her out of it and she said she wouldn't bring up the subject anymore, i still feel that i want to help her in someway. i'm afraid that if she saw a specialist that her illness may not meet the requirements for being diagnosed with bulimia nervosa because she may not engage in her self destructive behaviour as much. also that she may just lie about everything. once again i love my girlfriend and anything i do for her whether it somewhat impacts her life or not, i would do it out of love. i just want her to get better. any advice would be appreciated.",
"i m have struggled with eating disorders my entire life.. so here s the story. from when i was toddler till early teenager i had what i guess is now called arfid. i had no appetite whatsoever and barely ate at all during those years. because of it i never had the growth spurts other kids my age should have had. and when it comes to men being short had this horrible stigma so it s caused me to be really self conscious throughout my life. thankfully i grew out of arfid at the beginning of my teenage years and was good for a couple of years. flash forward to ages from late teen to now. i m now struggling with binge eating. i eat all day everyday and can t force myself to stop. i ve since become overweight, not so much that it seems impossible to lose but i m even more self conscience than i was before. it doesn t matter if i work out, cut out sugar and soda, cut out fried food, or only eat healthy, i can t lose the weight because i m constantly eating too much. i ve pretty much given up on weight loss until i can get it under control. so now it s time for my question. for those who struggle with binge eating, how do you control yourself? that s my biggest issue, that i have no self control. i want to start getting healthier so i can finally be comfortable with my body so any and all advice here is welcome.",

"php, child adolescent care to adult care and recovery dialouge. before i share this post, i want to emphasize that this is my own personal experience and perspective. it's not my intent to judge anyone and i def do not want to come across as anti recovery because that's not the case. anyway, this post will contain a few points but i'll start with the broad questions topics. 1. is iop php as strict as inpatient? obvi i know it's diff in many ways but i guess i'm asking in terms of clothing and everything like that. like are there the same rules and stuff like no strings, no phones etc? i know it depends on the program but i'm just wondering if anyone has any experiences 2. has anyone been in child adolescent care for their ed and then transferred to the adult unit when they turned 18? i'm 2 y o rn and i first met with a treatment team when i was 17. this was in feb 2 2 so right before the pandemic. i never actually started the php because i didn't want to miss school and it was also and also there is alot of conflict within my family so it wouldn't have been possible for me to do. 3. this is the most controversial, but i have alot of trouble with the recovery dialogue. i don't know what it is, but sometimes it makes me so angry and uncomfortable. it's almost like it's condescending and infantilizing me. like when people say to ""fuel your body"" it makes me feel as if i can only eat when my body needs fuel which is a tricky mindset to recover from change. again, this is my own perspective and inner struggle and it is not my intention to appear to be shaming anyone for having a different mindset than me. i just feel as if saying ""good job nourishing your body"" is the same as telling someone ""good job pampering yourself"" after they wash their hands. idk if this makes sense but it's something i struggle with and want to try and change my mindset. amp; x2 b; again, thanks for reading and i hope you all have a nice day : ",

"how do i deal with a sister s body weight related ocd?. basically i ve 24f struggled with disordered eating mostly binging but it started after a while of restricting and over exercising since i was 17. my weight has fluctuated a ton but for the last 2 years or so i ve felt like i have a better mindset and have been in more or less the same weight range. my youngest sister 17 has ocd and severe anxiety, among other things, and a lot of this manifests in worrying about her weight and body. she s at a healthy weight if not slightly under, but absolutely terrified of getting fat. she eats mostly normally but feels really bad if she doesn t work out for a day and is constantly asking my mom if she thinks she s eating too much, too much sugar, too many calories, if she thinks her stomach s getting big, if she ll get fat if she misses a day of exercise, etc., over and over. it makes me feel like shit and we ve talked about it before. for a while she tried not to do it in front of me but that ended up just amounting to her texting or whispering these questions to my mom instead. i ve asked her to talk about it in therapy for a long time and she s always either looking for a new therapist or talking about something else or has some other reason not to work on it. every time i tell her it s an issue she just says she knows she needs to get a better therapist or something. i get that it s partially an ocd compulsion but her mental illness triggers mine and it s so hard to be around. any help thoughts?",

"afraid to eat. to be quite honest, i don t know if i have an eating disorder. however, i do know that i m have a bad relationship with food. growing up, i was never skinny. it definitely affected the way i perceived myself because of it. i went from being told you need to stop eating. you ve had enough food. are you sure you want to eat that? to now being told, why aren t you eating? a diet is good for you you shouldn t be hungry anyway. why aren t you hungry? it s constant contradiction and it s messed with my head. now i m too disgusted to think about eating food. i m starving to the point where eating makes me sick. it s gotten to the point where i notice that whenever i move too quickly, my vision starts to blur and i feel all the blood leave my brain. for example, today i got up and stumbled backwards. i had to catch myself from falling. i know that eating one meal a day isn t sustainable, especially if it isn t enough calories. i just physically cannot force myself to eat more. i went from being obese to overweight. it s been a combination of exercise and not eating eating too much. i want to be able to eat and not feel judged. i think that some people forget that people who aren t skinny, get hungry. how do i fix this?",

"lock on the fridge for kids. i 34 f have two kids 12f, 1 m. i have struggled with binge eating all my life and am obese. it's not severe, but i do struggle with my relationship to food. now as a parent, i am dealing with the same thing in my 1 year old son and 12 year old daughter. i have no doubt i have passed some of my issues on to them. they've always been on the chubby side, but a recent move to a new town and the adjustment period has caused them some stress and both have gone from overweight to obese in less than 8 months. it is killing both their self esteem and their energy levels. i have witness both of them binge eating hoarding food, eating all throughout the night, sneaking and hiding food, eating huge amounts to the point of sickness in one sitting. i've known for a while that i needed to do something, and i started small. i tried talking to them, showing them how to healthily eat and that no food was good or bad, but some was unhealthy and okay in moderation. i got rid of soda, sweet tea and easy to eat snacks began keeping fruits and veggies. the weight keeps piling on them. if i buy cheese sticks they eat an entire bag in one sitting. if i buy ramen they eat 2 and 3 packs at the time. at dinner i have had to make a rule that if they want 2nds it will have to be veggies, because their first plate is so large and half full of whatever starch i cooked. even more concerning, my son has wet the bed three times after having canned soda in the evening when visitng his aunt she lives next door, he walks over just to get soda . being pre diabetic myself and it running in my family, i knew it was a possible sign of high blood sugar and began testing his fasting waking blood gluclose. it was 116, 113 and 112 on three different occasions. he has a doctors appointment to get that looked at, but i know, regardless, that we need to make a change, which leads me to the question: my kids are all for everyone in the house eating healthier i am more than willing to literally get rid of everything unhealthy and easy to make in the house and we can go out once or twice a week where they can have something they love but i have struggled with both my son and daughter staying up at night binge eating while i sleep. they will eat grits, pickles, cheese, bread, protien shakes, fruits, peanut butter from the jar, leftovers anything that is not a veggie and doesn't have to be thawed out to cook is fair game. it's like they are starving they are not. i don't deny them anything within reason i dont let them snack before dinner or eat three meals between breakfast and lunch . i'm basically just trying to replace all of the foods i thought triggered them with healthier options. but the night eating is getting ridiculous. and honestly i can't afford it. my food bill last month was 18 for a family of 5. my husband and mother suggested locking the fridge and pantry an night, but not restricting during the day letting them eat all the healthy food they want within reason. but im concerned thats a little controlling. will putting locks on the fridge only at night after everyone has been put to bed be too much? is it too controlling? would it give them less control than just not keeping binge foods in the house? do they need the sense of control, of feeling like they make the decision? will the lock make them feel like they are being punished? will it make them feel ashamed. i'm afraid my kids are on the cusp of developing the same issue that i have and i don't want to make it worse. how do i help them? i'm open to all suggestions, i just need some ideas and some advice.",
