"a list of resources amp; worksheets for eating disorder recovery. hey all, i notice a lot of people here often looking for resources on recovery, or on specific aspects of recovery, such as preventing relapses, stopping calorie counting, stopping body checking, etc. so i wanted to put together a list of resources that may be helpful for those seeking out or interested in recovery. the main resource in here is the list of 'recovery worksheets' from various online sources, most of these worksheets mainly use a modality called 'cognitive behavioral therapy' cbt which helps people learn how their thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and how to stop the harmful behavior associated. that being said, it's very important for me to mention that i am not a licensed clinical psychologist, and that recovery as a whole can differ a lot between people, what works for one person might not always work for another, so if you read through some of the resources below and don't find one to be particularly helpful for you, feel free to move past it and go on to the next, you know yourself and what you need best. additionally, if you're currently in a position where you feel as though you need medical or therapeutic intervention and can't commit to recovery on your own, please do seek out the support you need. in the 'additional resources' section below, i've included a couple of links to low cost therapy options that might be helpful for some to utilize they're only available in the u.s amp; canada though sorry about that, all the other resources mentioned however should be available worldwide . amp; x2 b; recovery worksheets: tackling avoided fear foods pdf https: www.cci.health.wa.gov.au media cci mental 2 health 2 professionals eating 2 disorders eating 2 disorders 2 2 worksheets eating 2 disorders 2 worksheet 2 2 2 2 2 tackling 2 avoided 2 foods.pdf types of thinking traps in eating disorders pdf https: www.cci.health.wa.gov.au media cci mental 2 health 2 professionals eating 2 disorders eating 2 disorders 2 2 information 2 sheets eating 2 disorders 2 information 2 sheet 2 2 28 2 2 unhelpful 2 thinking 2 styles.pdf the problems with calorie counting amp; how to stop counting calories pdf https: www.cci.health.wa.gov.au media cci mental 2 health 2 professionals eating 2 disorders eating 2 disorders 2 2 information 2 sheets eating 2 disorders 2 information 2 sheet 2 2 8 2 2 counting 2 calories.pdf reducing body checking pdf https: www.cci.health.wa.gov.au media cci mental 2 health 2 professionals eating 2 disorders eating 2 disorders 2 2 information 2 sheets eating 2 disorders 2 information 2 sheet 2 2 3 2 2 body 2 checking 2 and 2 avoidance.pdf questions to ask yourself to challenge negative thoughts https: i.imgur.com fecr4q .jpg the cycle of self injury pdf https: www.getselfhelp.co.uk docs models selfharm.pdf fact or opinion? pdf https: www.getselfhelp.co.uk docs factoropinion.pdf the 'stopp' method pdf https: www.getselfhelp.co.uk docs stopp.pdf preventing a relapse pdf https: www.anxietycanada.com sites default files relapseprevention.pdf 'my relapse prevention plan' cbt exercise worksheet https: i.imgur.com vr67rfq.jpg change process balance sheet why you want to recover exercise worksheet pdf https: www.cci.health.wa.gov.au media cci mental 2 health 2 professionals eating 2 disorders eating 2 disorders 2 2 worksheets eating 2 disorders 2 worksheet 2 2 1 2 2 change 2 process 2 balance 2 sheet.pdf thought record sheet for tracking triggering situations cbt exercise worksheet pdf https: www.getselfhelp.co.uk docs anorexiathoughtrecordsheet.pdf amp; x2 b; helpful articles: relationships and intimacy in eating disorder recovery https: www.psychologytoday.com us blog mindful musings 2 1911 relationships and intimacy in eating disorder recovery you don t have to feel beautiful to care for your body https: www.psychologytoday.com us blog beauty sick 2 18 6 you don t have feel beautiful care your body who suffers from eating disorders? https: www.psychologytoday.com us blog beauty sick 2 1812 eating disorders and who suffers them the six 'seductions' of anorexia https: www.psychologytoday.com us blog hunger artist 2 18 8 the six seductions anorexia let's talk about higher body weight anorexia https: benourished.org lets talk higher body weight anorexia 'how i healed from an eating disorder and stopped hating myself and my body' https: tinybuddha.com blog how i healed from an eating disorder and stopped hating myself and my body amp; x2 b; recovery podcasts: the eating disorder recovery podcast https: eatingdisorderrecoverypodcast.podbean.com the food psych podcast https: christyharrison.com all episodes amp; x2 b; books on recovery amp; developing better relationships with food: note: if you live in the us, uk, or canada, you may be able to find some of these books at your local library to borrow free of charge.

"i hate how normal diet culture is. i know this isn't a super hot take in this sub, but the way people casually perpetuate diet culture blows my mind. all the time people at my work just casually say ""i had a cheat day"" or ""i gained 8 pounds during my time off"" or ""i need to detox."" like?????????? it's so fucked up and especially as someone who struggles with ed behavior, it's so jarring to hear. i've tried my hardest to remove any language like that from my life and hearing it used so casually really sucks.",
"i literally just want to eat cake all the time. all i want to do is eat cake. like vanilla cake with fake vanilla frosting. that s all i want to eat and it seems like that s all i ll ever want to eat. i bought a lemon cake over the weekend and ate all of it. i want more cake. it seems weird to just stop what i m doing and get cake, i want to be free from food and it feels like i m still controlled by it.",
"a few thoughts on quasi recovery and getting older. so today is my birthday and i can't help but look back at the past year with a sense of loss. i feel like i lost most of the last year and a few years before that, if i'm being honest to my eating disorder. i can't stop thinking about what could've been if i was healthy. mostly, i just want this period of my life to be over. i don t remember most of my most recent relapse. all i really have is the hazy impression of constant headaches and just waiting for the day to end so i could do it all over again. however, i remember the months after so well that the memories feel painful. i was picking my way through the ruins of my life a sick body, a failed relationship, a personality i didn t recognize. and i was in pain. constantly being in conflict with my body hurts. feeling emotions after being numb for months hurts. losing access to coping mechanisms hurts. i never really chose to recover my body began to heal because the immediate stress triggers in my life went away, it got harder to restrict, and the extreme hunger was overwhelming. i stopped most of the disordered behaviors without addressing the underlying issues motivating them. i felt trapped in a spiral of quasi recovery, wanting to restrict to deal with the reemergence of my emotions and wanting to recover to resolve my health problems and stop the overwhelming guilt every time i ate. and there s been so much anger. anger that i m uncomfortable in this body no matter what size i am. anger that every meal is an internal battle. anger that has been misdirected at others for noticing or not noticing enough. i don t want to be a bitter person hurting others and myself. i, like a lot of people with eds, struggle with all or nothing thinking and perfectionism. lately, i ve been thinking a lot about this quote from to the lighthouse : gt;the great revelation had never come. the great revelation perhaps never did come. instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark. i kind of wish there were some moment of reckoning, some point where i resolved to dedicate myself to being better forever and that being the end of it at last. we all know it doesn't work like that. truthfully, i m not sure i m even ready to choose full recovery today. it s a terrifying, uncomfortable unknown and and god, do i like the feeling of control lmao . but i m twenty one years old today and i refuse to lose another year to this illness. i don t need to continue hurting for the pain i ve already felt to have been real. this has been a bit rambly but what i mean to say is that this year, i'm going to believe that time can be a chance for growth rather than a thing to be lost. the little miracles will come. i m gonna keep going, and i hope you will too : ",
the new curves dilemma. i know a lot of people here are either actively trying to regain their curves or are just happy with their boobs butt etc etc but dude for me it is the exact opposite even at my lowest i still had some curvature and i despised it so much. having gained enough weight to be normal now means i ve also gained fat in the exact places where i feel people stare at me and it disgusts meeeeee this is gonna sound odd but i used to look borderline like a guy with the right clothes on but now it s obvious i m a woman and i hate the attention i get. please. why can t women ever win.,
anyone else in recovery find it hard to eat around other people unless they are eating too?. i can t seem to eat if i m out with other people and they aren t eating. it s taken me years to even be comfortable eating around my husband alone. anyone else going through this? some days i feel so alone in this. i feel so silly because it s been years since i ve been at my lowest but the thoughts are always in the back of my mind.,
"recovery is worth it.. my best friend amp; i going to the theater tomorrow. something i couldnt do because of my ed. i spent time with my best friend amp; we were laughing so much. something i couldnt do because of my ed. i missed laughing so much. were making plans for vacations together. something i couldnt do because of my ed. i can enjoy my favorite movies and shows again. couldnt concentrate anymore. i can sleep way better. i care for others again instead thinking about food all the time. i have so much energy. no passing out in the shower or struggle to get out of bed. i dont like my body but if that means i can finally live again, i will accept myself.",
"social media and ed recovery. can we please talk about social media and ed recovery? social media can be so triggering sometimes with its fucked up algorithms. for example: i was looking on tiktok for some motivational edrecovery accounts. followed some accounts, liked some things etc. next thing, i go on my fyp and its filled with , weightloss tips, body checks even pro ana videos with the most triggering things ever like ""portionspo's, thinspo's, unhealthy weightgoals, toxic wieiad, calories etc . the same goes for instragram i'ts so weird and upsetting. i try to block all those accounts or click ""not interested"", but it is honestly so triggering. so weird how they don't delete those posts",
"avoid relapse advice. lately, the thoughts are so strong and i just really need encouragement from people that get it. every time i see pictures of myself pop up from a year ago when i was at my lw it just makes my body dysmorphia insane. i have gone all in and am weight restored after 2 years of struggling and i just don t know what to do the days i feel so so bad about my body. i love how strong i am now but it s like my head won t stop criticizing how i let go of what was once killing me. i just need help in conquering food guilt now that i m the weight i was when i decided to start disordered habits.",
"extreme hunger and set point weight. i ve been in all in recover for almost two months now and i ve recovered enough to reach a healthy weight. i m pretty much where i was pre ed, when i had a healthy body and regular periods which i have yet to gotten back . i dealt with extreme hunger pretty much every day since starting recovery, but i ve barely had an appetite lately. it s so weird, because i had multiple days where i would eat literal pound after pound of food, no problem. there was one day where i ate a family sized bag of cool ranch doritos, six donuts yes, six , like three bagels, and half a bag of cereal. i have no idea how the hell i managed to down all that because lately, a single meal satisfies me completely. i still have cravings from time to time and often think about food, but it s not nearly as obsessive as it was before. i almost feel normal. could it be that my body decided it was done dealing with extreme hunger as soon as i reached my set point weight? or could it be more physiological, and it s just me convincing myself that i don t need to eat extra anymore because i don t need to shouldn t gain any more weight ? just need a little help understanding this because i find it odd that i was ravenous a couple days ago and now food barely excites me.",
first day all in and cereal. yesterday was my first day all in without counting calories and doing exercise. it was hrd and i cried alot like fr i cried all afternoon . it was 7pm when i stopped crying and i know that i could have restricted and my stupid ed voice told me to not eat anyithing. but guess what ? i made myself a big bowl of cereal and after that i was still hungry extreme hunger ??? so i made myself a nutella toast and an cheese toast . it was my first time that i ever heard to my hunger. did i feel guilty ? yes. was it woth it? hell yeah,
"bn to bed to an back to bed ? or extreme hunger?. background info for a few years i struggled with binge eating and bulimia; about halfway through last year i had gained some weight assuming from the binge eating and living at college drinking etc , which drove me to want to lose weight. over the next few months i healthily lost some weight through exercise and a slight caloric deficit, however it soon developed into anorexia. i became fixated on calories, and over the next few months i started to obsessively exercise and restrict what i was eating. i had lost a little bit of weight and my family had commented on it, but i didn t really think anything of it. it wasn t until i started obsessively having to close my apple watch rings and became incredibly restrictive with food stopped b p habits by now to the point where eating and exercise had taken over my life. when i moved to university in feb i lost a lot of weight to the point where i had no muscle, was eating less than a toddler, engaging in compulsive exercise and burning thousands of calories a day. i had to cut out exercise when starting recovery because my relationship with it was so disordered i could not afford to lose any more weight. this is when i was diagnosed with anorexia and i ve been in recovery for the past 3 4 months. since starting my recovery, about a month into regular eating i started getting extreme hunger and urges to binge. and when i say binge i mean eating thousands of calories in a sitting. it kind of makes sense since the caloric deficit i created over several months would be massive so my body is crying for food, and after researching extreme hunger post starvation hyperphagia, minnesota starvation experiment tabitha farrar, binge eating in recovery, most of these sources have said that i should give in to the binges in to it in order for my body to trust itself and these extreme hunger episodes to go away. however this binge eating has become extreme; originally once a week but is now every day sometimes even multiple times a day even though i'm not restricting at all not purging, no exercise or anything and i am rapidly gaining weight back several kg's in a few weeks and it is terrifying me. i cannot control myself around food, and now i am scared that i have gone from one extreme an to the other bed , considering i previously struggled with binge eating and bulimia. i am not sure if this is post starvation hyperphagia extreme hunger after restriction or a relapse in binging and it's terrifying me because i keep gaining weight, have extreme bloating, facial edema and swelling in my feet and feel like i don't know how to eat normally and am never going to be able to exercise again without it being disordered. i am embarrassed to go out in public because of the rapid weight gain, and i'm really not sure if this is a normal response to anorexia and if i should honor my immense hunger? or if i have relapsed into binge eating and i'm terrified its going to become bulimia and im going to become overweight. i just feel like i'm convincing myself it's extreme hunger as an excuse to eat, but no matter how much i eat, even if i am full i am not satisfied. attachments area replyforward ",
"taking time off uni. i m in my second semester of full time uni and also work around 15 2 hours a week. i started recovery about 3 weeks ago and i feel like i m definitely spreading myself too thin the approach in the program that i m in at the moment isn t all in and i find myself both physically and emotionally exhausted. i ve had such a hard time accepting that i need a break and not being incredibly busy all the time because i know that s probably the eating disorder trying to distract me from recovery eating. i ve always been an overachiever and i wanted to push myself to finish my double degree early get ahead by doing winter summer terms too. all i can think about is food and honestly some days even beginning to honour my extreme hunger feels like it consumes my entire day. or, since increasing my intake i ll get hungry every hour or so and challenging my ed thoughts is such a distraction and i feel like i m falling behind. i ve also fallen into a bit of a depression which makes it harder to face everyday and makes me incredibly tired. i know it ll probably be better in the long run to take a bit of a break i m doing 4 units at the moment and want to drop to 3 dropping anymore than that would make me feel like a bit of a failure and like i m falling behind : . just looking for some advice stories of those who have undertaken recovery whilst in uni.",
"i m turning things around. today started off awful. after breakfast, my mum said that we should check my weight and it turned out i ve reached a new low. that once would have made me happy but now i m just worried for my health. so i m committing to recovery. i went to bross bagels with my mum and brother for lunch, i got a sesame seed bagel with a ton of cream cheese and smoked salmon which was a huge fear food particularly all the cream cheese but knowing that i needed to gain weight made it a lot less scary. and the bagel was fantastic and then i got a vegan oat milk chocolate bar i will recover from this.",
"struggling. someone please tell me the constant thoughts in your head when you eat eventually go away... i can not take it anymore. with every bite of food i take it's constant ridicule in my head about ""that's enough"" or ""i can't believe you're still eating"" i just can't take it anymore it's so utterly exhausting and makes me thoroughly disgusted in myself. i need someone to understand and empathize with me because i feel like no one in my life get's what i'm saying, or downplays it to make me feel insufficient. i can't keep going with this cycle and seriously fear a relapse if i can't figure it out soon. it's all that i can think about.",
"i am going to the cheesecake factory tomorrow and i cannot wait . i have not been to a restaurant in ages and ages where i haven t been struck with panic and poring over menus online for days before trying to work out what i can eat. in fact, if i could, i avoided eating out entirely. tomorrow i m meeting friends at the cheesecake factory and i intend to order whatever i want. i m so excited what should i get? i already told my friend to make me get a piece of cheesecake even if i decide i don t want one because deep down i will want it, even if im not hungry for it at that moment. i don t think i ve had cheesecake in 1 years or more. anyway, this is a super light post but im so glad i feel happy about this big adventure tomorrow haha",
stomach problems in recovery?. so maybe this is tmi idk but im currently at the beginning of recovery and i am having some annoying things occur which i m not sure if they re symptoms or not. 1. ik constipation is a symptom as well as bloating both of which i m going thru currently but my stomach makes so many weird sounds now? like i m not hungry so it s not hunger grumbling yet my stomach is just making sounds and it s kinda embarrassing tbh. 2. my other thing is that whenever i burp which for some reason is a lot now that i m in recovery? is that normal too? i feel like i m full of air or gas for some reason it s like burping after drinking carbonation. idk how else to describe it but it s like got the burn that u get after drinking soda and burping i m not sure y tho. i don t rlly like soda or carbonation in my drinks at all so idk what else would cause jt? r these normal recovery symptoms?,
"i think i did recovery wrong and thought it was all in... in the beginning of my recovery due to extreme gastro issues. i had to only eat a liquid diet boost and others drinks and by late may i was slowly able to eat and the extreme hunger kicked in around june and july with extreme hunger i was meal prepping and i know i m not suppose to be calorie counting but i don t think i had the minimum of all in.. but i figured it was bc it satisfied me. during my recovery i started a brand new job and was living with my abusive mother. i finally have a great stable job that i love and i m out of her house. however, after around 2 3 months of extreme hunger my appetite is slowed and i think it may be a relapse. i have gained a significant amount of weight and i don t know what s happening at all. my goal is to get my metabolism back, my hunger cues back and balance my hormones. i m really scared i wasn t eating enough calories in my all in but i was also working and starting a new job and couldn t be eating 24 7.. has this ever happened to anyone? i just feel so scared. i m getting online help and will start to see what i can do to improve things",
"has it ever turned out to be more than just amenorrhea?. still working through recovery, have gained weight, haven t gotten my period yet, and it s been a little over two years since i ve gotten one. i started taking birth control for a hormone boost and have gotten one fake period and my doctors amp; i are hoping that my body will regulate itself over time as i continue to take the hormone supplements. i can t help but start to get paranoid that there s another underlying cause that has compromised my reproductive system because i now weigh more than i did when i got my last natural period. has anyone ever experienced a similar thing and gotten diagnosed with a separate condition and or left infertile? or do i just need to be more patient with myself and potentially gain more weight?",
"heart palpitations. i don't understand why i still have heart palpitations. i've been eating. my most recent lab work showed now low electrolytes, all came normal. ecg's and ekg's have always shown a healthy heart. so why am i still having them every day? they scare me and stress me out. and yes i've heard it's anxiety. but even if i'm chilling i feel them. i don't like it.",
night sweats. is this just a general recovery thing or is it specifically a sign i m not eating enough? it s not the most unpleasant thing in the world i find the headaches and getting tired easily much worse and much more obvious signs of undernourishment i m just curious. lately i ve been waking up every day drenched in sweat lol.,
"balance is bullshit i think. right?. for context: went to residential, significantly beyond weight restored, experienced extreme hunger at start of recovery but have been eating at or beyond recovery minimums for months most of what i eat is processed ""junk"" food or high fat, high sugar foods: chips, chocolate, pastries, cookies, fries, you get it. it's just what i like eating. i'll have some fruit or something when i crave something fresh, but most of the time i just like snacky, junky food. i had some of these foods at residential, but the dietician always told us ""these foods are part of every diet in moderation. "" she also preached ""a balance of protein, fats, and carbs,"" which makes sense except the foods that i genuinely crave now are mainly carbs, with fats as flavor. in my ed i tracked protein religiously, and i don't want to end up like that again. but is it okay for me to eat like this? even long term? how long will it last, if other people have experienced this?",
"how do y all deal with recovery and socializing?. i m trying recovery round 2 lol again and am now going through a second bought of extreme hunger. i m often eating past comfortable physical fullness but am still ravenously mentally hungry, but doing my best to honour it. unfortunately all the uncomfortable physical side effects make it kind of impossible to socialize and i feel pretty sad isolated. i m supposed to go meet some friends for dinner, but it s currently 4 pm where i live and i m already pretty bloated tired from eating and still mentally hungry. i don t want to cancel because i really want to see them, but i just physically don t know if i m up to it. i frequently find that i have to cancel or rethink plans because i m almost always eating past comfortable physical fullness, and then i just don t feel up to leaving the house for the rest of the day. on top of this i find when i am feeling up to socializing, i have a difficult time feeling present and engaged because i m usually preoccupied with food. i feel less preoccupied with food and more present when i m restricting. i know the answer is to just keep eating until i m weight restored and my extreme hunger dies down, but i just feel really lonely and isolated now because of recovery. it sucks almost feeling like my life is on pause while i m going through recovery : ",
"how do i return to normal eating?. after 3 years of recovery, even significantly weight restored past my pre ed weight, at a weight and bmi i thought i d never get to, i m eating all the time. most of it processed, high fat and sugar, and definitely not healthy . i m gaining weight at a rate even faster than i was in residential, which honestly doesn t make me jump for joy. i m outgrowing my clothes practically faster than i can buy new ones. but even though all of these things are happening that are making me unhappy, i keep eating. why? i don t know. sometimes i wish it were different, that i ate a strict 3 meals and 3 snacks, that i wasn t always hanging around the kitchen eating just because i can. am i doing the right thing? my dietician in residential wanted me to eat more mindfully and stop to monitor my hunger, but i m scared that my ed would just use that as an excuse to mentally restrict. no one s even forcing me to eat this much; i eat 3 regular sized meals with my family and then go crazy grazing on snacks throughout the day. even when i m anxious or conscious of my body i still eat like this. it s not physical hunger, either, it s almost like a habit that i couldn t stop unless i really forced myself to. i feel slightly guilty, but i don t know if my eating habits will normalize, and what that will look like",

"every time i think i m fully recovered, i realize another toxic behaviour mindset of mine. didn t know what to flair it as, but could be seen as triggering for some so idk. as the title says, i always think i m fully recovered until i realize some of my old behaviour or ways of thinking are still there in some degree. like wanting to be petite or feeling like crap when someone close to me that s usually more attractive becomes more petite than i, i feel kinda shitty. then i feel shitty for even having those thoughts. then i feel even shittier because i realize i m not fully recovered.",
"what's your favorite food? why?. any stories associated with it? for me it is definitely chicken nuggets. i'm 32 now, but i still find these as the ultimate happy place for me. they are hard sometimes to eat for me as they are a happy memory and bring me back, but gosh were they good. everything from the tyson ones, to the little kid dinosaur ones. what about all of you? super",
"what should i do ?. hello, i m going inpatient next week and idk what i should do till i go there. i m scared that when i go all in now and gaining lots of weight in treatment i have to that i cant stop eating when i m home again bc i started all in bevore and that i end up overweight or develop bed i dont want to say that its bad to be overweight i m just scared . so what should i do ??",

"dae get winded af and dizzy super easily doing light movement?. it's been since dec jan i've been ""all in."" i gained 4 lbs just recently weighed myself for the first time since starting and omg idk if it was worth it lol . anyway, i've also been depressed so haven't walked more than to the bathroom and kitchen for months i quit my job and i haven't seen any of my friends or gone out . i used to overexercise a shit ton walking, weightlifting . anyway, today my dad was helping me move a couple things out of a college house i'm in rn. i got hot, sweaty, dizzy, nauseous, and genuinely felt like i was gonna throw up or pass out. it was brutal, nothing like how i remember moving in in august 2 21 . the house actually has two units and i'm in the upper one which means the back door in on the second floor and you have to walk down a flight of stairs to touch cement. so, like it was a few trips from the house down the stairs to the car, but i was dying by the second walk up the stairs. i don't get it, shouldn't movement like this be easy? like, why was it easy for me when i was at my worst?",
"relapse while trying to be a supportive partner. i ve been recovered or recovering from my ed for over 3 years after struggling with it for most of my teens and young adulthood. i thought all my disordered behaviours were a thing of the past. i was finally able to be in a loving relationship which was something my eating disorder was keeping me from for a long time. i ve talked about my past struggles with my girlfriend and she knows that i use to have an eating disorder but have now built a stronger relationship with food and with my body. i ve never been this happy and healthy. but i ve had a slip up with food restriction and purging while she s been away. the first one this bad in years. my girlfriend is going through a tough time because she lost a family member and had to travel to her home country for the funeral. since we found out, i ve been trying to be as supportive as i can since i know she has a lot on her plate. she s been away for a couple of weeks now and it feels like i ve been hiding things from her, mainly how i feel my ed rearing its ugly head again. i feel like the secrecy is making it worse but i don t want her to worry about me because she s already super stressed about everything else. i m afraid not telling her about the slip up will endanger our relationship and make me full on relapse. but i m not sure she can take worrying about another person right now. any advice on preventing a relapse or protecting my relationship would be appreciated ",
"why can t i accept my current body?. i ve been in recovery for about a year now, gained a lot of weight from going all in, but am so much less food obsessed now, and am very grateful for how far i ve come. but, i have struggled so hard to let go of the idea that this is my temporary body. i just can t let go of the feeling that i look better at a lower weight, and so the desire to be at a lower weight never goes away. this being said, i never want to be at my lowest weight again, or even close to it. but i just can t let go of the part of me that wishes to be smaller. i ve been especially struggling with this lately, as i ve just ended a relationship, and am more conscious about how my body might be perceived. accepting my current body feels like lowering my own standards for myself, which i just can t get past. any tips advice on getting over this would be very much appreciated, as i ve felt pretty stuck on it for most of recovery.",
"tw: why am i losing weight in ed recovery?. so i've been in recovery for a while now, and initially gained a lot of weight until i was a long long way above my already plus size pre ed body. took a long time to accept myself but i finally did, stopped gaining weight and maintained for long enough for me to replace my entire wardrobe with clothes for my new body. i accepted i'd never be smaller again without damaging my health. for a few months i've stopped eating recovery minimums a next step my nutritionist helped me take since i'd been in recovery for 2 years by then and began the process of learning how to eat intuitively. nowadays i honour my hunger and don't really think about food much apart from when im hungry which is amazing and so freeing. however recently i had to get weighed at the doctors for some new meds, i asked for it to be blind but it was on the documents so i ended up seeing it after inadvertently, and i've lost significant weight since they last weighed me. however my main feeling is disappointment. i feel like a failure for losing weight even though it wasn't intentional. and idk why i feel this way? i keep obsessing over some way i was inadvertently restricting myself and how on earth i managed to rack up a caloric deficit and now every time i want to eat a fruit or something i'm worrying i somehow subconsciously craved a grapefruit because i'm relapsing when i'm not, i just wanted a grapefruit. idk. does anyone have any advice? i'm so anti diet culture and the other day my coworker said i look thinner and to keep up the good work doesn't know about my ed and i pass as fat so... society smh and it feels like i'm failing.",
"not able to restrict in recovery... recovery win?. i've noticed something while in recovery and that it that i find it harder and harder to restrict. even if i have plans to restrict like telling myself im only gonna have certain foods this day later on i just give in and eat what i want to. i know i shouldnt be restricting while recovering but what i've noticed from my previous attempts to recover and now is that i would find it sooo easy to fall back on ed behaviours before and now it's getting much... harder. my ed grieves this and tells me i'll never be able to relapse and i was still am scared of it. but i think this is the reason why. my ed for the most part has been fueled by the intent to harm myself. when i started i knew exactly what i was getting myself into yet willingly went through with it. in every sense, it was like i ""gave myself"" an ed. and the reason i found it so easy to relapse before was because that drive to harm myself never really went away. but now, i find that i hate myself less lol and i kinda dont wanna destroy myself anymore, so even if my brain tells me to starve i can never carry through. which is a good thing. so i guess the point of all this waffling is to share my story and also to point out the importance of the mental aspect of recovery. because i find that when the mind recovers, the body also follows. i've been able to eat somewhat normally without overthinking too much, follow eh cues etc. since my brain doesnt panic too much anymore and have sort of just given up on the idea of self destruction if that makes any sense. anyway im still eating my peanut butter and toast, and this week has been the first time ive gained a substantial amount of weight in a year. good luck to me hop i can keep it up",
"dae think about food less when hungry?. my digestion and hunger signals are pretty out of whack and i can go days without feeling anything recognizable as physical hunger, but those days are always filled with weird intrusive thoughts about food are you hungry now? are you sure? does this sound good? but on the days when my physical hunger signals are coming, it s more like oh this is definitely hunger and then i eat and the whole thing is more or less over with. does anyone else experience this? how to make it stop?",

"day 9 of going all in... struggling. today hasn't been great. maybe don't read this if hearing about restrictive thoughts triggers you. though i don't name any numbers or anything specific. it started with me eating a protein pudding and cereal for breakfast, then also having the two breadrolls i packed for school. i felt so uncomfortable in my body that i struggled with picking out my outfit. i almost missed my bus because of this. at the bus stop, i accidentally turned of my phone. it's a new one and i hadn't memorized the code, so i wasn't able to use my phone all day. at school, the hot weather really got to me. i had no energy. i only felt better after drinking coffee. our school sells baked goods as well, but i bought an apple with my coffee instead. i'm such a coward. my teacher gave out chocolate to us in class and it took me a while to muster up the courage to eat it. but i did it. she looked at me while i was eating it. she knows about my ed, because i broke into tears once when she asked me if i had lost weight a few months ago. she's been very supportive and let me know that she's always there for me when i need help. after school, i had to wait almost an hour for my bus. i killed some time by visiting the grocery store. i got a salmon wrap to eat while waiting for the bus and some snacks for home, since my snack stash is almost empty. i ate the wrap and was full. but mental hunger was still present. i was craving something sweet. i had packed a protein bar for school. and even though i felt like restricting, i still ate it. i missed my second bus and ended up having to walk home. in the scorching sun. i have some blisters on my feet now. i feel like i ate too much already and the will to restrict is so so strong. today's dinner will be burgers. i usually have two. but i'm so scared. even just eating one will be a struggle for me. i hate being like this. my ed is so loud today. and it's impacting evrything else as well. i hate everything today. i just want this day to end already. i know that i need all the calories i can get. i have to eat more. i need to increase to finally start gaining some more weight. i've been stuck at the same weight for a while now. that's the reason i went all in to begin with. but can i really call this all in? when i'm thinking of restricting? when i still get scared of the calories? fuck. maybe i can't do this on my own. i was doing so well these past few days. today feels like a huge setback. the thought of fasting even crossed my mind. i know i wouldn't be able to do it. but man, i really scared myself there. i'll have dinner in maybe an hour from now. i'm so scared. i want to cry. but ill try to push through. i might give an update afterwards. i'm sorry for spreading so much negativity. amp; x2 b; update: i ended up having one burger for dinner. it was yummy. i don't know how to feel about it. i'm a bit diappointed in myself. i usually would have had two, but i couldn't bring myself to eat another one. i did get an ice cream bar for dessert though my thoughts are all over the place. did i restrict? did i eat too much? did i eat enough? why did i almost have a breakdown over a protein bar today, but still eat ice cream after dinner? for now, i should distract myself and stop thinking about it. though i think there's still something holding me back and i can't just ignore it. obviously, the restrictive thoughts are all too present. and the more i give into small restrictions, the louder the ed voice gets. it starts with the first food decisions i make in a day, like pouring myself a smaller portion of cereal on purpose. even if i eat more afterwards, i still restricted. this has to stop.",
"eating disorders and acne possible tw . have any of you guys developed acne skin problems while dealing with an eating disorder? i dealt with a restrictive ed from the beginning of 2 21 to early 2 22, and during that time, i had amenorrhea, and i also developed skin problems. i started experiencing hormonal acne for the very first time, and generally developed acne prone, sensitive skin. moreover, my face began to scar so easily and it takes forever for scars to disappear. i m weight restored now, and have been for about two months. i ve had two periods. i m still dealing with skin concerns, though. my question is whether or not any of you have experienced something like this. after weight restoration, did it take some time for your symptoms specifically skin problems to resolve? if so, how long?",

"sudden body change causing distress. for context, i have been in an recovery for a little over a year and have been weight restored for most of that time. on the night of august 12, i got home very late after getting in a very stressful and emotional conversation that lasted about an hour. as i hadn t eaten in a very long time and was probably mentally fatigued, i helped myself to a lot of leftover pasta from my family s dinner, two pieces of garlic bread, and some peanut butter. i then went straight to bed whereas i normally would have done my workout routine because i was so tired. since then, my body has felt so different that i am really struggling to feel comfortable in my own skin. gt; the scale has been fluctuating wildly: the day after this incident, my weight went up two and a half pounds. it has since bounced around erratically between that higher number and what i usually weigh. lt; i will admit that in these past four days i have eaten a lot more than i normally would mostly in the form of peanut butter, as i seem to be craving it a lot , but those initial emotions of distress aren t there anymore. in fact, when i ve eaten these past few days, i genuinely feel fine and never eat to the point of sickness or anything. i m not bored, either i just seem to keep feeling hungry no matter what and for mostly higher calorie foods, too . more distressing, however, has been how my body actually physically feels. my entire abdomen feels not only much bigger than it was, but much squishier. it genuinely feels like i have just a thick pad of water covering my entire stomach that i can t take off. i have continued to work out but this is not changing anything about how my body feels. i know that i haven t atrophied because i am still able to exercise without difficulty, but you cannot see my muscle tone at all now. gt; i also noticed today with a tape measure that i have gained a full half inch around my waist, which is also visible by the increased number of fat rolls i now have when sitting or laying down. lt; i genuinely do not think i have felt this way physically since i first started inpatient treatment and was gaining weight rapidly. i can only really go around in super loose clothes because anything else makes me feel too ashamed. is it possible for my entire physique to change that fast? i have read that bloating is common in scenarios like this, and yeah, that would be expected after a high carb and sodium meal like i had on the 15th. but is it normal for those body changes to last this long? will i ever feel like i did before this again? i am trying to hydrate a lot and am maintaining my workout routine, but the discomfort is not going away which is making it really hard for me to eat without guilt.",
"eating in college. hi all so im moving in to college one week from tomorrow. im super nervous to begin with, and then there is the whole food aspect. the idea of dining halls really kinda scares me, and it doesn't help that ive heard the food at my school is trash. originally i was going to try to get a single room and mostly eat there, but that didn't work out so i have a roommate who i don't know now, and that brings a whole new set of stressors. how do you guys navigate following a meal plan or keeping up with your intake while at college? ill also be doing a lot of walking as my campus is pretty big so that's also a factor. ill be getting weekly weigh ins and stuff at the health center there since my doctor is hesitant to let me go, and i really do not want to get there an be sent home. thanks ",

"i think i ve had artificial periods for two years and now finally get proper, biological periods again. warning: very much tmi. basically the title. my eating disorder started when i was an early teen and i lost my period for two years, which was the major reason why i eventually recovered. after i recovered i started taking the pill at age 17. i then relapsed at the beginning of the pandemic, but caught myself quickly after a few months. i thought i was in recovery, retrospectively it was quasi recovery though. i was still at a weight that was unnatural for my body. however, i thought i was in the clear, since i still got my period every month. i suspect that those were actually artificial periods, created by the pill. i changed the pill i was on when i was at my lowest weight and my periods got increasingly lighter. not even periods really, more like bloody discharge i have always been a heavy bleeder naturally . i attributed this to the change of the pill, but now i m sure it was because of my low weight. well, i started proper recovery three months ago. the best decision i ve made this year. i just walked to the bus stop and i felt something of course i was wearing white pants . well, i ran home and went home, and there it was: proper blood. and lots of it. even though i m in the middle of the sachet and should actually start my period in two weeks time. i haven t been this happy about a period in years. this is proof that i am doing what s right for my body, and i couldn t be more happy and proud of myself. just wanted to share my small little victory.",

"because there just aren t enough eh posts on here haha. tw: calories and weight mentioned okay. so, now that it s been explained to me that eh can be triggered by eating, i definitely have it. when i don t eat, i m not consumed or preoccupied by food at this point, but as soon as i start, it s as if i can t stop and it s pretty out of control, especially at night. at this point i m hovering around 11 112 pounds at 5 6, up from about 1 2 or so i ve never been that caught up in numbers, but that range . i would say i m eating about 6k calories a day and have been for the past 6 weeks. after two weeks my weight hit where it is now and it s not budging. i am aware this is still underweight, but not sure how to gain without literally making myself sick eating so much. the eh comes in because it s super sporadic. some days i have it and some i don t, i d say it s about 5 5 , so some days i hit recovery minimums and others im going nuts with like 1 k calories a day. i feel like i should hit about 125 pounds to truly be healthy. not sure how to do this without counting and feeling like crap stuffing myself ..anyone else been through this? have you struggled to gain at fort and then suddenly you do? i m stunned i actually want to gain, but i truly do. i feel so much better at 112 i can only imagine how much better i d feel fully in the healthy bmi range",

"shopping with my mother is a new level of torture. i love my mother, and probably always will. but like a lot of those in the ed community, my disorder was partly started and promoted by her. she pushes and pushes and pushes until you snap, and once you do she acts like you're the one who started the whole mess. i know i'm certainly flawed, but it pains me to see myself acting like my mother at times. the short temper, the yelling and fighting, the victimizing. last week i went shopping for new clothes with my mom for school. i think she still thinks im as small as i was during the height of my ed. i told her my fears about growing out of the clothes she picked out for me, saying the possibility that i might gain more weight within a few months or something like that. i've returned to a pretty healthy weight and am eating regularly, pretty much physically recovered but that doesn't mean its not a possibility. i just really didn't want any clothes that were tight or left marks on my stomach because of their indents. but my mother just said that ""its fine"" and just to ""not gain anymore weight."" for some reason that really ticked me off. she's the one who assumed i had an eating disorder, but ever since then shes never talked about it. shes never said anything about it with me, and has continued to talk about her dieting and her workouts and how ""fat"" she is. its like my eating disorder and depression dont exist to her, like im just having a phase. it pains me to watch my sister growing into my mother. i hope if she learns anything from me, she learns to not take everything my mother does at face value. over the years i've seen my mothers flaws and realized why she is the way she is, but it doesnt make it any easier. i just wish i new how to articulate my words, i wish i could figure out how to tell her, ask her to stop. to just stop talking about it with me? everyone in my family thinks im too ""sensitive"" because of the things i believe, but its so frustrating to hear them appeal to diet culture and their racism, im just so sick of being unable to voice my opinions without being twisted out to be the bad guy. maybe i'm developing a victim complex though now, too.",

"all in amp; ""overshoot"" weight redistribution. hi all i just need to put my thoughts out there right now because it's doing me no good holding them in lol. first of all, i've been all in since the beginning of june, and i am just starting to feel a bit better i began nutritional rehabilitation weight restoration in the beginning of april, and i was ""weight restored"" when i began all in for context, i was never clinically ""underweight"" to begin with , so i guess i've been actively recovering for a little over 4 months now it feels strange, and a large part of me is questioning the decision to recover... i don't really feel like i want to. this life that i have now is more miserable than the one i had when i was actively restricting. i know semi starvation affects how we remember things amp; what we remember, and that i could be blocking out the miserable aspects of life during high restriction, but i just don't know how much longer i can continue on living the life that i am right now. just to clarify, i am not suicidal i do not want to end my life, and i am hopeful that it will get better, but i am just feeling so impatient. i have relapsed 3 times in the past 8 years, and i am currently in recovery from my third and most painful relapse. i have very, very strong urges to restrict in an effort to lose the ""overshoot"" weight i have put on. i feel very, very uncomfortable in this body. i don't feel strong, healthy, or energized, like some people claim they do with weight gain. i feel lethargic, weighed down, and constricted. to console myself, i binge. i no longer restrict after binging, as i am all too familiar with that harmful cycle, but the binging has not gone away. instead of being triggered by restriction, my binges are triggered by feelings of shame and helplessness about myself. i am trying to ride the wave of this ""overshoot,"" but i can't help myself from hoping this weight will melt off. i have heard so many mixed stories, where some people lose their ""overshoot"" weight and some don't, and where some people experience weight redistribution and some don't. i understand that we all have different bodies and different recoveries, and that my desire to lose the ""overshoot"" and have my weight redistribute is inherently disordered, but i just can't imagine living like this forever. i don't feel free. i'm tired of seeing influencers claim that they gained weight, but also gained ""happiness, freedom, and their lives back."" i'm happy for them, but this is not realistic. my weight gain has been accompanied by misery and preoccupation with my body. i guess this post is just my way of seeking reassurance that recovery will work out and things will get better. that weight gain ceases to feel like an obstacle. that the desire to lose weight control my body will subside. i need convincing that losing weight is not the answer.",

"day 8 of going all in. haven't got much to share today, aside from a few wins : my boss brought plum cake to work again and i had a slice at lunch break. then, a few hours later, her mom visited and she brought a freshly baked plum cake. it was still warm, straight out of the oven. i think their family has a thing for plum cake lmao everyone gathered to get a slice. and i had one too. i broke a major ed rule right there. having two slices of cake, even though i wasn't hungry. and two slices of the same type of cake at that. but honestly, how can anyone refuse fresh cake out of the oven? it tastes so much better when it's warm. and it was a lot better than the cake my boss brought which was from a bakery in the city she lives in though, when i cut myself a slice of the mom's cake, she told me to get a bigger slice. i felt a bit weird eating in front of everyone. i usually don't struggle with eating in public, but since all my coworkers know about my ed my mom told them behind my back... but they don't know that i know i feel like i'm being watched whenever i'm eating around them or even when food is around. they offer me food all the time. and i used to refuse every time, but i'm getting more comfortable with accepting it. but only if i feel like eating. if i genuinely don't want anything, i won't force myself to eat. it's just hard to differentiate between my ed not wanting me to eat and the real me not wanting to eat not being hungry. tomorrow will be our one year anniversary in our new building and also the last day of work for one of our dentists i work at a dentist's and ironically, we only ever have sugary food around haha . i've got school tomorrow and usually wouldn't be at work, but i'm thinking about paying them a visit after school. i know there'll be cake etc. and it does make me a bit anxious. part of me wants to join them. the other part wants to stay at home. i'll decide spontaneously. if i do decide to go, i'd like to bring something as well. i absolutely love baking and i'd like to bake some cake or cupcakes, but i don't know if i'll even have enough time after school. hmmm..",

"weird sleeping patterns in recovery. okay, i m on day 8 of all in and you can probably wage from my post history that i m more doing like 5 75 in because i m still probably not eating nearly enough or truly listening to my hunger don t have a meal plan am mostly mechanically eating three meals a day and having a snack a couple of times a day if i feel like it but i notice that ever since i stopped counting calories and started eating a bit less restrictively not without restrictions, mind you, and most definitely not enough either calorically or in general my sleep patterns have been getting weirder. i notice that almost every night i wake up at least twice from about 2 to 5 am i usually get up somewhere in between 7 to 9 and last night i literally woke up like once every hour or so between 2 and 6. my first time restricting was when i was a teenager, and weirdly enough i remember a similar thing happening for a couple of months after i stopped, but it was never this extreme for reference both my first period restricting and my current relapse have both lasted about four months i m just wondering if this is a normal recovery experience or if it s a sign that i m not eating enough and should try to get more food in.",

"i think i develop ed in times of stress. as the title says, when i m happy and everything is going great, i m hungry and i eat very well and i notice my weight looking great. when things are going super bad, like for instance now, i m in a stressful living situation and no car. i m about to purchase a car so i know just being able to take myself to the store or wherever to eat will get better but my roommate will cook food and i get so embarrassed to eat in front of anyone right now because i know i will only eat like a little bit. then i ll eventually start to get nauseous because for some reason, i just don t want it. i also just do better eating alone right now but i tried that last night and still was only able to take 3 5 bites and then get nauseous. so i stopped. idk how to fix this and idk why my body reacts this way in times like this. i want my weight back but i can hardly scarf down and almond. does anyone have any advise?",
"my mum's comment changed my relationship with food and i relapsed. a few weeks ago my mum, whom i live with, was completely exhausted because of her sleeping problems, so i asked her why she couldn't sleep. apparently one reason was that she was worried about me regarding my mental health, my ""unhealthy"" eating habits and that i don't do sports bc ""it could really get you out of crisis"" . i've told her before that this isn't something i want to talk to her about since i've had issues with anorexia in the past. at the end of our conversation she apologised by saying she was just all over the place mentally which is why she couldn't think straight and choose her words wisely. anyways, i was in shock afterwards because what the hell? i thought i was doing well with recovery, eating intuitively, and then she just comes up to me and makes it seem like i was doing something incredibly wrong. and it has changed how i viewed food from then on. i'm very distant from it now and all the past anorexic thoughts are coming back. i'm also keeping my distance from her, because she has hurt me and probably wouldn't understand me or just feel guilty if i told her about my experience. it sucks, because, on the one hand, she's still family and i'm supposed to trust her, but on the other, she just doesn't seem to get me. unfortunately, my therapist is coming back in a couple of weeks and i don't know what to do. it's really hard for me to stand up for myself regarding this topic so maybe you could give me your opinions on my mum's behaviour so i know i'm not overreacting. also any advice on how to deal with my mum and this anti intuitive eating stuff would help a lot. or anything in general... also: i've recently posted another question regarding this situation, but i just wanted to go more into detail about my mum's comment, in case you were wondering.",

"how to cope with dad who talks about his weight loss journey. my dad knows about my eating disorder. recently he has been trying to lose weight and has been exercising everyday on the bike. obviously i am okay that he can do what he wants etc. however, he talks consistently about how many calories he has burned today. he talks to me about it because he has no one else to talk too about it he s quite a private and alone man . i am in recovery and hearing this makes me feel like i need to be doing the same thing. i should be burning calories etc. he also comments on woman s bodies on tv. we are watching the sports on tv and he always says something like look at the size of her and she s too heavy for that diving board. i just feel like he s doing the same thing with me in his own head. i am in bulimia recovery and i have gained weight. so my brain is thinking he is judging me this way. i didn t grow up with my dad so our relationship is a bit complex. i m just easily triggered by his comments. i wish he could stop.",
"i realized that i haven t experienced joyful movement in ten years. i wasn t sure what flair to use. but realizing this is recovery progress, i guess. i was definitely in denial before. literally every single time i am active or move my body, it was is a way i burn calories to earn my food. even activities i genuinely love like riding horses and hiking in the woods, walking my dog, gardening with my husband, it is always an activity i have to do to earn food. i took up long distance running because horseback riding is something i haven t been able to afford anymore and i say i like running and that it is great stress relief, but i m not sure i actually even like running. but whenever i am doing any kind of physical activity, i am always looking at my fitness tracker to check my heart rate or looking at the time to see how long i have been moving for calories burned, so i know when i will be able to stop. only when i feel like i have burned enough. i am never present. never mindful. this makes me feel very sad. i hope i can one day experience joyful movement and participate in activities because i enjoy it and not because it s something that burns excess calories. when does the ability to enjoy physical activity and be truly present come back?",

"day 7 of going all in. it's been a full week of all in recovery for me. and i already feel like i've made lots of progress mentally i want to keep my journal updated as well, but i haven't found the time or motivation to. so these posts serve as a stand in for my journal in a sense. today my family and i went swimming. i had a protein pudding, an apple, a protein bar and a sandwich for breakfast. my family, except for my brother who had a bowl of cereal, didn't eat breakfast. this would have triggered me a few days ago, but now i try to ignore it. it's their choice, their loss. i expected us to get something at the pool, but we didn't. we ended up not having lunch and ordered pizza for dinner. it was my suggestion. i was craving pizza so much. and i was so hungry, since i hadn't eaten in for like 1 hours. so i enjoyed my goddamn pizza. my biggest fear food is slowly turning into something i can enjoy again : i also snacked on some pizza bread afterwards. i am full and satisfied now. pizza used to give me panic attacks. i felt horrible the first few times i had it in recovery. but now i can recognize that the fullness i get from a pizza is normal. i just wasn't used to it. and that was probably why pizza scared me so much. and i won't let myself get triggered by my mom only eating a single slice of pizza anymore. her small portions are very worrying. but i shouldn't let it affect me. i tried talking some sense into her, but she doesn't listen. it's not like i can force her to eat more. just like she can't force me. for now i have to focus on myself. even if it's hard to do that when you live with someone who shows signs of disordered eating.",

"low natural set point? is it a thing?. i know this is a weird question, but how can i ""justify"" that i am underweight and that i need to gain? today i weighed gt; 51,5kg lt; at a height of gt; 17 cm lt;, as a 22 year old man. i have maintained a bit of a lower weight than that for 1 year that i know of, only recently past few weeks, month or two have i gained weight and can actually ""feel"" different my stomach flaps are objectively thicker than before, and my ribcage is less visible . my question again is how can i tell myself i actually need to gain weight? in my head, or at least in my ed head, i tell myself that maybe that low weight is my natural set point, since i've maintained said weight for such a long time. i think a lot about food and calories and exercise etc., always planning meals and ""planning"" binges e.g. i always eat x amounts of candy on saturday evening , so i obviously have ed behaviors, but can i still be at my ""natural"" weight regardless? i know very few people naturally have a low bmi, so what if i'm one of the few who is supposed to be at gt; a bmi of 18 lt;? i just want to hear your thoughts on this matter; because i feel ""wrong"" in gaining weight in case i'm already at my set point, which is admittedly low.",

"worried that i might have an eating disorder. sorry because i kind of wrote a longer post than i intended, but i needed to get some things out.. i've been struggling with being overweight for as long as i can remember 28 now . i've tried some healthy ways to get myself to a healthy spot, but i just lost the weight, gained it back, lost a bit, and gained back more... now after the pandemic i'm at my heaviest i've ever been and it really does make me sad. i know that it's unhealthy and i want to get to a good spot again, but it's like i'm unable to. i don't know if it's a food addiction or some form of bed or what. i often find myself eating more than what is normal usually not healthy food , even though i have healthy options at home since my intention was to eat healthy when i was in the supermarket . or i get these cravings for certain foods and while i'm buying it i'm literally thinking don't do it: it's unhealthy, you'll gain more weight,... and still i do it while i'm thinking it : it's not like i have these random moments where i suddenly would eat anything within reach, regardless of what it is. it's really craving and ""bingeing"" if you will on the unhealthy foods either for dinner and or something like chips or other snacks late at night . then i get these periods where i try to be more strict because obviously just trying to buy and cook the healthy food isn't working since it's already at home. then i start to register literally everything and all the calories that i eat and start restricting, which just feels unhealthy and obsessive too... then after a few days or weeks of being strict with what i eat, i fall right back into the bad eating habits of eating too much and unhealthy... like there's no in between. i've made an appointment with a therapist that i can see later this year because i feel like there is something wrong with me that i can't just eat healthily and normally, even though i know the risks of being overweight and i hate looking like i do as well... at the same time i sometimes think it's just me being lazy with no self control and discipline and that there is nothing wrong with me except being addicted to junk food or something. i worry that they won't be able to help me since it's me who needs to be strong enough to say no to myself and the urges.... i constantly get comments from my family as well saying that i need to do something, that it's not healthy,... as if i don't know that already. my grandma even goes as far as comparing me to other overweight people and making comments. it honestly makes me feel more ashamed of myself and my body than i already am and i just want to tell them to mind their own freaking business as a side note, i have hirsutism which already destroyed my self esteem . i don't know, i just feel crappy about my eating behaviors and i don't know why i do it, how to be normal or to get myself healthy again and keep it that way. i'm worried that it's a life long battle that i'm just gonna give up at some point because i don't want to constantly think about calories and weight day in day out...",

"day 6 of going all in. it's already the morning of day 7, but i realized that i haven't made a post specifically for day 6 yet, though i did already post on here yesterday. so. yesterday was an amazing day. my ed, though still present, was so quiet. i mainly had healthy thoughts, i think. i am starting to trust my body. i was mentally hungry after a small breakfast, so i had a second one and a morning snack after that. and after dinner, i realized i hadn't eaten a lot and that i definitely needed more if i want to gain weight. so i had more, which gave me a stomach ache. but i didn't feel bad about having a bloated stomach. i rested and let my body do its thing. it knows how to handle on its own. and then it hit me: i am accepting weight gain.. finally. not only am i accepting it, i am actively working towards it. and if that means i can enjoy all the food i want, then hell yeah come at me, weight gain i still have body dysmorphia, but it's not as strong as it used to be. i looked at my bloated stomach yesterday and i didn't see myself as huge. i was reminded that this is normal. body dysmorphia is stronger when i look in the mirror. but when i see myself in pictures, i can recognize that i look sick. that must be how everyone else sees me. and no, i don't think it's pretty. it's sad. it's sad that i destroyed my body like this. i still have a lot of healing to do. while i am frustrated over how slowly i'm going, i've realized that it's all for a reason. when i first entered recovery, i only increased my intake by a bit and didn't tackle the mental side of things. it all felt so pointless. i almost wanted to give up, thinking there's no way i can recover. i heard somewhere, that you first need to nourish yourself a bit in order to be able to make mental progress and only once you're starting to heal mentally, you can heal physically. it all goes hand in hand. and honestly, i can see this in my progress. i started by nourishing myself and by building new habits. now that my brain has enough energy to function and now that i have a point of reference, i can process everything and think about what my goal is. so i'd say my day 6 being so good mentally was only possible because i gave my body and brain the energy to function properly. i noticed that i'm much happier on days i eat enough. ""binges"" though they aren't really binges do set me back a bit, but i still keep going. when i wake up the day after having eaten a lot more than i usually would, i realize that i'm completely fine. and that's quite relieving and freeing. anyways, i hope today will be just as nice my family and i will visit the indoor swimming pool we always used to visit when i was a kid. and i'm already so excited i hope to eat some food that reminds me of the good old days, as well : ",
honeymoon phase of recovery?. idk if this is a thing or not but if it is i think i might be entering it? day 6 of all in. evening 7. not even thinking of calories. i made cookies more like little cookie balls because of how they ended up i used what i thought was almond flour but is actually ground almond and the fat doesn t mix with it the same way flour does so they ended up not really you know that thing cookies do in the oven where they kind of expand? that didn t happen. but they taste really good and had a for dinner a mini pizza they called it a pizette and a cake pop if i don t have some sort of little sweet with every meal i will lose my mind from an italian bakery and i m still hungry and weirdly enough i don t mind it? like yay dessert time like a kid at a buffet i did some journaling today and wrote a list of reasons to recover so idk if that s like keeping me going or something but i feel really good and optimistic about being able to heal my body. and about being able to enjoy baking again i got really into baking right before this relapse hit and now i m excited to get back into it.,
"stuck in body avoidance. i've been in recovery for almost 4 years now, and have gotten a lot out of it the ability to feel joy, to think about things other than food, and honestly a lot of pride in having hauled myself out of a really deep pit. but i feel that my recovery plateaued at avoidance getting rid of mirrors might be a major step in early recovery, but i don't really want to live forever without being able to judge if my shirt matches my shoes. it sounds silly, but it sucks to feel like i have to avoid my recovery body in order not to get sucked into the old pit again. i'm generally quite good about sticking to recovered behavior and my thought patterns aren't particularly plagued until i try to diverge from avoidant behaviors, and then i feel really awful until i go back to them. generally speaking, i allow negative thoughts to exist as neutral things like bad neighbors, they're there, but it's my house. when i stop avoidance, they start banging on my ceiling, essentially, and it's much harder to cope with them. avoidance and practiced neutrality has kept me healthy and was very helpful, but i can't help but want to move past it, because it doesn't feel like an end goal. i can't be playing tag with my reflection for the rest of my life i suppose i'm looking for advice on becoming truly body positive, but really it's about how to outgrow survival mindset and move on to something more. neutrality feels as much like a coping mechanism as anything else. all the advice i see is for people in the early stages of recovery and fair enough that stuff is no joke but i'm struggling to feel truly recovered with this mindset. it's not an awful place to be, but i want to move on. is that realistic?",

"problems about recovery that i wasn t expecting to face, would appreciate advice. so it s been like 2 full days since i had this doctors visit that jumpstarted me into wanting to recover. i decided immediately after that visit that if i want to eat something, i am going to eat it because i can t just keep losing weight. however this has proved to be much more difficult complicated than i expected and i m not quite sure what the next step should be. the problem is that i am eating more, but i can t seem to make myself eat many calorically dense foods i m eating mostly vegetables, fruit, and some proteins like eggs so i am afraid that all i am currently doing is at most stopping my weight loss. i tried using different online calculators to find my bmr but since i haven t been counting calories i can really only guess if im hitting that or not. also i don t know if those calculators work for people suffering the effects of an ed. i really need to be actively gaining weight but i don t really know how to do that in a safe way. plus, i m a dance minor and school is about to start so as much as i need to rest in order to not raise my energy expenditure, i need to build muscle mass in order to have to the strength i need to do my work. i ve never tried to intentionally gain weight before. i feel like maybe i would benefit from a meal plan so i have some kind of structure? should i try seeking out a dietitian? i don t know, i just feel like im taking shots in the dark at the moment.",

"slowly learning to honour my hunger more. day 6 of all in i m slowly realizing that i m probably half assing this and am more doing about a half of the way in right about now because i m still probably not eating enough, am still doing quite a bit of walking, and still consuming a lot of safe foods just in higher quantities. even today s little victory, which was having a second bowl of ice cream because i was still hungry after the one i had with for lunch it s really hot out today, don t judge me for having ice cream for lunch , is only so big, because the ice cream i had was a diet brand with less sugar more protein and fibre imagine like a canadian halo top . but i wanted more, so i got it, even though it was only about an hour after lunch. i m not counting calories in fact i ve been scratching out calorie counts and nutrition labels on food around the house but if i had to ballpark estimate my intake it would probably be at about gt; 15 2 lt; a day, more some days and less others. my hunger signals are totally broken so it s hard to truly honour them : i have cravings but they re usually not intense and sometimes come and go within seconds and when i do experience physical hunger it s often paired with this complete mental apathy towards food so i don t end up wanting anything. where i m at right now is thinking i can t wait to recover and give my body the rest it needs and eat what i want to help it heal while i m supposed to be doing just that.",

"how to support girlfriend during relapse?. i hope this is the right subreddit for this, so sorry if it's not. my girlfriend has had a really bad anorexia relapse she struggled with eating problems in some way her whole life apparantly, but i don't think it has been that bad before last autumn, then started recovering in spring. though i am aware now it was just quasi recovery, she was eating at exactly maintenance and still obsess over that number instead of the lower one from before. now i fear she's back to restricting more. she gained a small amount of weight since recovering, and now believes she has to lose that weight again. she's not back to eating as little as she used to, but her first relapse also started her by losing a bit of weight though light restriction. i feel completely helpless. we are long distance, so most of our talks are through text, which makes it even more difficult to show up when we're together in person i just offer her a hug, have meals and snacks with her so she doesn't have to eat lone, or sit with here while she's feeling down, but it's so hard to help through text only. i just don't know what to say when she talks about how fat she is, or that she doesn't deserve to eat, or that shes ""out of control"" for eating like... a 1 cals over maintenance . rational arguments don't work, obviously, and just saying that i feel sorry or that i'm here for here starts ringing hollow, to the point she sometimes gets upset over me just repeating these things over and over again even though i mean them . she sometimes says she wants me to to convince her to eat, but when i try i just feel like we're pointlessly arguing, and when i don't have the capacities for it because it does take a lot out of me, unfortunately i feel saying no hurts her because she already feels like she's a burden on me. i just... don't know what to do, or what she needs from me during this time. i've asked her, and she doesn't know. i've talked to my friends, i've read through forums online, i've read self help books for both partners of people with eating disorders and people with eating disorders, and i still just feel like i'm watching helplessly and like there's nothing i can do. i know i can't possibly safe here, but i feel like there's more i can do that just listen to her talk about how disgusting and terrible she is all day? i don't know. is there anything that someone in this relapse stage needs to hear from a loved one that isn't basically just ""i'm sorry you're going through this"" and ""i'm here to listen to you if you want""? and what does she need to hear when she goes on a long rant about being disgusting or ""eating like a pig"" or needing to lose weight?",
"my aunt is my role model.. just a little vent. she had an eating disorder when she was younger when she was in college, and she is fully recovered now, after having being hospitalized. i never knew this until my mom told me about it. but, her and my mom had a coffee get together today and they were talking about me and she said that if she had 6, needed to go to school to be my advocate to get better she would : she s literally always thinking about me and texting my mom asking how i m doing and shit : it makes me so emotional and like i don t want to talk to her and potentially bring back triggering memories even tho she tells my mom all the time that i can message her whenever and she wants to talk to me i just feel like i can t tho. i really am trying to get better and she is one of my main motivations on doing that. she is such a good person and i want her to be proud of me like i am of her.",
"yo when am i gonna stop throwing up in my mouth 85 times a day?. tw: this is gross. sorry i used to purge a lot. for context. can any ex purgers tell me what your experience has been? deadass every single time i eat anything, i will regurgitate small amounts of it into my throat mouth dozens of times over the course of several hours after eating. it feels just like a burp but there's no air. just food that gets progressively more acidic as time passes, and it will become painful. sometimes it happens to me on an empty stomach and i will have straight acid come into my mouth and burn me. it happened when i was laying down once and it got up onto my nose, eyes and ears. i cried because it burned so bad. i am not exaggerating when i say this happens dozens of times after every single meal or snack i eat. thankfully at this point, i can anticipate it happening and swallow it before it makes it up into my mouth. and it usually makes no sound either, so people can't tell. but jesus christ. i fucking hate this. it feels disgusting and it hurts sometimes too. i'm assuming that my gastro esophogeal sphincter is weakened because of repetitive purging over the course of several months. so it just can't keep the shit inside my stomach anymore, i guess. i don't know : i had an ulcer from purging and i took medication for 3 months to heal it, so my stomach is really back to normal now. i just throw up in my mouth a million times a day. : did i just ruin my body forever? also, is this going to erode my esophogus over time and hurt me? fuck. this is all involuntary and uncontrollable so i really have no idea what to do about it, if it is damaging me. don't do bulimia kids. i'm serious it will fucking hurt you",
"wait. calories aren't even that scary.... uhm, major revelation? i have no i idea how this crossed my mind. but i was scrolling through posts about recovery and someone talked about eating over maintenance. ever since i stopped tracking calories, i've had no reference of what my maintenance would be. i used to calculate it almost daily, but now that number doesn't matter, since i'm not trying to stay in it anyways. but from what i remember, that number was ridiculously low. it couldn't have been accurate. when i first started recovery, it was semi recovery. i wasn't trying to get healthy. and i was too scared to go over that ridiculous maintenance number. looking back at it, i can recognize how incredibly restrictive my diet was. now i'm much more comfortable with a higher calorie intake. my disordered thoughts creep in at weird times, like when i eat more often in the day, when i eat larger amounts of ""unhealthy"" things or when i eat fear foods. but overall, i've come such a long way : my memory of the time before my ed is a bit blurry. but what i know for sure, is that i had no clue about my maintenance. i didn't even know what a calorie is. i just ate whatever i wanted, as much as i wanted. did i gain weight? no. of course my weight fluctuated, that's normal. i was a bit chubbier at one point and i wouldn't exactly want to go back to that body at the moment. but i felt so carefree. i had lots of issues, but food wasn't one of them. it all began when i joined in on lent even though i'm not christian, but it was trendy to join in at the time by cutting out all sweets, snacks and junk food, as well as all drinks other than water. my goal was to get clearer skin. though i wasn't happy with my body, so the secondary goal of weight loss was added soon after. and it all went downhill from there. i thought i was doing the right thing by restricting. it was how everyone around me and on social media lost weight. i just went down this spiral very quickly, it turned into an addiction. i wish i never found out about calories. why couldn't i just have stayed blissfully ignorant? but i'm determined to get back my freedom. life is so much more enjoyable when you don't restrict your happiness.",

"am i the only person here who thinks bed is an actual eating disorder and isn t just mental hunger?. disclaimer: there is nothing wrong with eating as a response to emotions. humans do it all the time. it becomes a problem when the food is no longer helping you difficult to define, i know. it s something you define over a long term pattern of behavior, and with the help of a nutritionist. if you suspect you are binging, talk to your treatment team and that while eh and mh are real and should be honored, it s important to be vigilant about binging behaviors even though they are not as harmful as restriction? and when one does notice binging, it is a sign that some sort of restriction is happening somewhere else and that something needs to change? i ve been weight restored for 2 years. i eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 2 snacks. once or twice a week i make my way down to the kitchen and consume half a container of parmesan, half a thing of pb, leftovers scooped out of containers with my hand while standing in front of the fridge, and various baking ingredients like a bowl of brown sugar and chocolate chips. to me, this is both physically and emotionally unpleasant but is also a pleasure seeking behavior. and there is a clear pattern to it; i do it at night and especially if i ve been socializing or drinking. this is binging. it is not driven by hunger, mental or otherwise. i have intense social anxiety, and i eat to calm myself. or if i have even one drink i m a lightweight i am consumed by a desire to make my life fun and entertaining in that moment, and i do it with food. bed is real.",

"day 5 of going all in. are you guys sick of me yet? lol so, i'm feeling really good today. honestly, i think i feel better on days i don't give in to any restrictions and just have what i want. today was one of those days. breakfast was my usual: cereal with a sandwich, this time with sourdough bread. it was quite filling and satisfying. at work, i had my coffee with a biscoff biscuit. i drink my coffee black, because i've learned to love the pure coffee flavor. even if i wasn't scared of liquid calories, i'd still have it black. i do try to have cookies with my coffee though and it's amazing everytime. today i only had to work until 2:3 , so i had lunch at home. and guess what? i finally had a pain au chocolat. i ended up not having one yesterday. but my mom brought fresh ones today and i had one, along with an apple. sadly, it wasn't nearly as good as i remember, but i'm still glad i had it. now i satisfied that craving. i had a slight stomach ache afterwards, though i'm not sure why. maybe i'm not used to having pastry? dunno.. dinner was fish sticks with potatoes, cooked veggies and a little side salad. my mom gave me shit for not adding any dressing, but i genuinely don't really like salad dressing. leave me be lmao and for dessert, i had this coconut almond ice cream https: m.media amazon.com images i 61ln r8exxl. sl1476 .jpg which i've been wanting to try for months now, but i've been too scared to challenge it. until today. the white chocolate had coconut flakes and it was the best part. the ice cream itself wasn't that special, just vanilla ice cream with a slight touch of coconut. still, i'm glad i had it. i could have had a lower calorie one, but i decided to listen to what i truly wanted. the ice cream was okay, but the chocolate bar https: www.worldofsweets.de out pictures master product 2 raffaello tafel 9 g no2 1 27.jpg and the original praline https: m.media amazon.com images i 61tcwhvpbtl. sl1 .jpg are a 1 1 . a must try for anyone who loves coconut tomorrow i'm in charge of dinner and i plan on making ramen. it'll be simple, just a spiced up version of instant ramen by adding fresh veggies and maybe marinated eggs. i haven't eaten ramen in so long. it used to be my ultimate comfort food, but my ed turned it into one of my biggest fear foods for no reason. i kinda want to slap my ed in the face by adding chili oil or something, but that might be too big of a challenge for now. and sunday my family and i will go swimming at the pool we used to visit all the time when we were younger. and a part of every visit was to eat the trashy yet somehow comforting fast food they offered. that, or mcdonalds. fast food hits different when you go swimming and smell like chlorine lol we haven't gone swimming in years. and i'm already so excited for it. it'll be a huge nostalgia kick. and to make the experience as nostalgic as possible, i want to have the trashy fast food. it's just part of the experience. i won't let my ed take that from me, nuh uh. this is your sign to eat something that reminds you of your childhood or of a happy memory. food can make an already enjoyable experience even more memorable. i hope to create many more happy memories for myself : ",

"the pain of having an eating disorder. having an eating disorder is being in constant mental agony, day and night. there's hardly any room for real joy or connection with people around you when you are sick with an eating disorder. you are starving yourself, so your body can only focus on the food you are eating, when you will get it and how much. yet, you are afraid of eating and afraid of gaining weight at the same time. to suffer from anorexia nervosa feels like you are being tortured. and like you can't escape it. your thoughts become gray and you feel so alone. if you suffer from the illness long enough, you will get used to being in pain. when people try to step in and tell you have a serious illness and you need help, it feels threatening to you. this illness is all that you know and you are so used to it by now, some days you feel like you would rather die than give it up. that's the tragedy of life with an eating disorder. you know what's happening to you is unhealthy and you know you need help, yet you keep going. then you develop medical complications, end up in the hospital and realize how sick you actually are. i think the hardest thing about having anorexia is the effect it has on your mind. because you feel like your own mind is against you. yet there's a comfort in the illness, and that's why it's so deadly and hard to recover from. an eating disorder isn't fun or cute. it's painful for the individual and heartbreaking for everyone who loves the person. i wish that i did not suffer from one and that i was healthy",

"can't get past this mental struggle. i am an avid planner; i always decide what i'll eat, approximately when whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or evening snack, times vary slightly , and most importantly how much i'll eat. take today as an example; for breakfast i have my normal bowl of granola with a banana. lunch is two slices of toast with some sour cream, around 15 grams of salmon, veggies and a glass of milk. dinner is going to be half a pizza, and evening snack is a bowl of granola with two small cups of yoghurt. i feel like this is ""maximum"" of what i'm allowed, and even this is me eating beyond fullness, physically speaking. but what if i want a cup of hot chocolate? what if i want some scoops of ice cream, or a couple rows of toblerone or other candy? i ""can't"" fit it into my day of eating, and if i did i would substitute it with something else, but i already want all the things i'd planned to eat. i know the answer to this struggle is probably ""just eat all you planned and chocholate, ice cream, hot chocolate etc.""; but it's so much easier said than done.",

dumb triggers. i really wanted to have greek yogurt with breakfast but we re out so i went to the store and bought the cheapest thing of greek yogurt but it s the kind with added sugar and it s also the kind that s in individual containers so i know exactly how many portions i would be having and i would know exactly how many calories and sugar i would be consuming even after covering it up with sharpie and i lost my appetite like i literally will have this thing where if i know the calories in something or if i know how unhealthy it is i ll just lose my whole fucking appetite. at least it was only 3 so i didn t waste that much money.,
"are therapists obliged to call the police or admit you to a clinic when they find out you're anorexic?. i just haven't told her yet and i'm worried she might get others involved if i she knew since anorexia technically risks your life. for now, i just want to talk to her bc that's already a big step.",
"recovery dilemma. so i know the negative effects of exercise during recovery. however, my minor at school is dance and as such i have a couple of dance classes and related things i am supposed to do in this upcoming semester. i lost a lot, probably pretty much all my muscle mass this summer as such i need to build up my strength again in order to dance, but i don t want to do anything that puts me in danger. any ideas on what the best course of action would be?",
"struggling with recovery. just as a disclaimer ig i don't think i have an ed and i've never been diagnosed with one. i'm in recovery from severe malnutrition and one of the other subs i posted in said that y'all might have some good advice i'm now just over a month out from a doctors visit where i was nearly hospitalized they ended up agreeing to outpatient treatment as long as i follow the treatment plan which was 3 meals a day plus snacks supplements . both my parents were there at the appointment with me and heard this stuff. physically, it's been going well so far i do still struggle obviously but generally i feel a lot better overall more energy, less nausea, less depression, etc but my main issue is that my mom has these really bad body image issues i guess and she keeps projecting them onto me. like she won't shut up. it's only been a few weeks and i still get bouts of dizziness and she's already telling me i'm getting too fat and i need to start exercising to ""make up for everything i'm eating"" and i need a flat stomach and on and on and on nitpicking everything. i'm still literally underweight because it's only been a few weeks and i'm struggling to figure out what amount of food i should be eating because my idea of that was so skewed earlier and i really don't know how to deal with this. she's kind of always been critical like this but she's just now started becoming this vocal about it. i could be peacefully eating lunch and she comes up to me and tells me to make sure i don't put on too much weight and that i shouldn't get fat. i guess how do i deal with this? i genuinely want to recover but i feel like my mom is trying to give me an eating disorder and i've never been one of those people who could just do the ""in one ear out the other"" thing that everyone keeps telling me to do. moving out is also not an option at least for a few months. i've found myself internalizing some of what she's saying already and i really don't want to go there",
"im tired.. last year was the first time i ever was able to lose weight and look the best and healthiest i ve ever looked felt. i ve been diagnosed with bed for about a year, but have struggled with a constant binge restrict battle for the past decade. february of this year i reached my healthiest self at my lowest weight i felt amazing, my confidence was up, i was dating, i actually went out on the weekends, and life was fun. i was restricting heavily, doing omad, but it was easy. ever since reaching my lowest weight, i ve been gaining back all the pounds i lost. i ve tried countless times to get back into the honeymoon phase although i know it probably won t ever come back. i can t restrict at all like i used to, and can only last one or two days if i can, before i binge. i can t even get myself to workout even though i enjoy exercising, it s like my mind throws a tantrum when i think about hitting my daily movement goals nothing crazy either . unlike last year when i lived alone and had more control over my environment, i m living with my family who prioritizes cooking. most of the time the meals aren t safe or healthy enough for me, and being home with them has made it harder to stay distracted from tempting snacks and treats. this also means i m not able to count calories anymore. theres nothing i want more than to be back in restriction, exercising, and making progress. the only time motivation hits is when i m sick of binging and begin daydreaming about getting back on track by restricting and losing weight. there are time where i think i want to focus on recovery and eating an adequate amount to keep me full while also losing weight in a healthy way. but this makes me feel even more like a failure. it s like i won t allow myself to lose weight unless i do it through starving : i am just a little tired.",
"finally gave in. i have been avoiding the foods i crave. especially throughout the day. yes, i know it's restriction. i know i have been. tonight though, after my planned 8:3 snack, i realized i was still unsatisfied. i kept thinking about the granola and almonds in the cabinet. so i got up, and served myself. i even added a frozen gogurt because, damn, they are good. is the eating disorder mad, ofc. am i happy? heck yeah. i'm satisfied for once. i don't want to be scared of weight restoration. i can't be scared of food anymore. i just want a job. i just want to be free to walk as much as i want. i need me back.",
"starting recovery.. i've been struggling with an eating disorder for several years now, mostly anorexia and orthorexia but in the past few years binging and bulimia as well. there have been some very, very intense lows and i've tried to recover before. it feels like for years i've been stuck i'm a dust storm of calorie counts, failed fasts, desperation, self hatred, and just never ending stress about my body and self. now i'm trying to recover again literally as of a few hours ago after a relapse which started in december. this relapse actually followed a really great recovery period which spanned almost one year before. anyway, i keep coming back to this thought of other times i tried to recover, how if i had pushed through then i'd be somewhere much better mentally now. i don't blame myself and this doesn't bring me down it gives me a lot of excitement about what the future holds if i can stick to this. some things i think will be easier this time: i have more drive than ever for this. i am more sick of my ed than ever. i've conquered a lot of triggers in my life and set boundaries around them. some things i think will be harder this time: i'm about to move which i am so excited for but i also find myself thinking, ""you need to be thin when you start your new life and meet all those new people "" and i weigh more now than i ever have before in my life. it makes it hard to not think i should be thinner before i start recovery but i know recovery can't work like that for me.",
"chosing to end my pro ed friendship.. choosing hi everyone i would love to hear about similar experiences to this and could really use some support. a little backstory: i've had an eating disorder for several years. i developed it at 19. at some point i gave recovery a shot and it didn't last long and i relapsed. for the next few years i'd go months or years deep in my ed but then interspersed by small bouts of trying to recover. well, since 2 2 i have been able to make my small recovery bouts longer and longer. things were going very well in 2 21 and i was in recovery for almost the entire year until winter. i relapsed in winter up until now. during this time i made friends with someone on edtwt and we would write everyday about our eds. not just the struggles but our current goals and things like that. now we are friends on our personal instagrams and other platforms. fast forward to now: next month i am moving and between wanting to start my new life on the right foot and also feeling soo soooo incredibly drained by my ed i really want to try my best to try to recover again. here's my problem; i do feel triggered by my pro ed friend. i really like her and am feeling guilty about wanting to end the friendship. ""why cut it off instead of just create boundaries over ed stuff and just be normal friends?"" you may ask. well, she's really struggling with her ed too and it's a big part of her life right now. it is always something we talk about even when we try not to. we've also tried recovering together before and i do feel like right now i'd be very triggered if we did this again and she relapsed. it would trigger me to relapse i feel. she's not trying to recover now either. i think this is a journey i need to take on my own but i feel super guilty. i also feel like the friendship inherently reminds me of ed topics a lot even when we do discuss other stuff. this is a big part of it actually there's just a part of me that doesn't feel able to recover when we are friends. has anyone else been in this position before? please don't judge me for this. i feel really bad about it but i think it's what might be best for me.",

"bread. i love bread so much idk why i let diet culture or my ed or anybody else tell me bread isn t good for you. or that it s empty calories your body needs calories period especially in recovery, we don t call fuel that comes from a shitty gas station empty gas because it s not premium or ideal or not filling i had two slices while cutting up bread for french toast and honestly that feels like a decent breakfast for now. and this is unrelated but im also proud of myself because i broke two food rules at once no meal can be just carbs no eating less than twelve hours after last eating ",
"day 4, evening 5 of all in recovery. anyone else hit a point of apathy towards food? like i get super duper hungry and than i prepare a decent meal by that i mean throwing tofu into some leftover ramen and a half of a melon bun one of my favourite snacks that i almost never have because it s so hard to find and i just feel nothing? i ate more or less mechanically because i stopped being hungry after the first few bites and it was a small enough portion to not be worth bothering throwing it back in the fridge plus i m leaving tomorrow anyways and i don t want to leave food behind and now i m kind of unsure if i m full or hungry. it s weird, i was so excited when i found the melon bun at the bakery yesterday i can remember the last time i had one it was in february of 2 2 , i was on a trip to seattle, and that was a time in my life where my ed was basically nonexistent and than i actually had half of it with dinner i like to pair something sweet with all of my meals and it was fine, i guess. maybe i m just in a general low mood because i haven t ate much today or just because i m bummed out about leaving my mom s place tomorrow or something. i will say that this food apathy kind of goes both ways. i had lunch with a friend today and it was a decent meal i had something called a bilbao wrap idk if this is specific to the place i went to or if it s a common term sorry an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, and a chai tea latte which even a week ago the idea of unknown liquid calories would have been daunting to me so that s a fear food challenged at a mexican cafe and i wasn t even thinking of the calories. i was thinking wow, this wrap is tasty, i like the pear and the cheese, i like this cookie, this latte is hot, etc. there was no sense of guilt about eating, i was enjoying my meal, chatting with my friend and her friend who works at the restaurant, and in general i had a really great time catching up with her. i just have such weird hunger signals. like i ll be hungry as hell and than i won t even be halfway to the kitchen before it dissipates. but i know i have a lot of mental hunger, but usually that just results in me thinking about food as like, a concept, as opposed to having a specific craving. or like, i ll crave something, but it ll be unattainable like i ll be hit with a craving for peanut butter when i m out of the house and can t have any, and than by the time i get home the craving is just gone so i can t really honour it. it would be nice just once to have a craving that i can honour on the spot. maybe i m out and about too much for somebody who s recovering it probably wouldn t kill me to do a bit less walking but i just get bored being cooped up inside all the time, i like to get out and take photographs, and just explore the neighbourhood. tomorrow i m heading back to my dad s and i m looking forward to the road trip. i might get some snacks i ve been really craving for the ride back or i might just find some interesting places on the way there. i can t handle chain restaurants because of calorie counts on menus the law here is that any restaurant with more than 1 locations has to list calories but honestly that just means i get to have more exciting food.",
"day 4 of going all in. guys, i finally had cake yay : it was a piece of the plum cake my boss brought to work yesterday. honestly, it was very underwhelming, but i wanted to try it. that, along with two cookies i had with my coffee, was my lunch. breakfast was two sandwiches one with honey, banana and cinnamon, the other with chicken cold cuts, cream cheese and lettuce . and just now for dinner i had three pancakes with honey, cinnamon and blueberries. i'm very full right now, actually. my mom brought a pain au chocolat for me from the bakery she works at. it'll be stale tomorrow. i'm not hungry, nor am i really craving anything right now. but maybe i'll still eat it later? i'm not sure. after dinner, i thought i ate a lot today. but, like yesterday, writing down everything i ate today makes me realize that it wasn't that much. it was all very calorie dense though. which makes me feel like i've made some great process : instead of having lots of low calorie things today, i ate in a smaller volume, just with more calories. and it was a very sweet day lol the only savory thing i had was that second sandwich for my breakfast. i'm learning to embrace my sweet tooth again lt;3 you know what? now i do want to eat the pain au chocolat. i'm scared i'll regret it though. hmm amp; x2 b; edit: okay. i'm not sure how to feel about it, but i counted everything together. and i really didn't have a lot today. i'm still thinking about that pain au chocolat. and i'm still physically very full. i hate that i counted calories to figure out whether i can should have more to eat. i'll go to bed soon anyways, so i'm questioning if it's really worth it to eat more now. i am satisfied. or maybe not? i mean, i wouldn't be calculating if i wasn't mentally hungry for that pain au chocolat. but at the same time, the thought of eating makes me a bit nauseous right now. it's though.",

going back to treatment. i started my first round of treatment about a year ago and was doing really well for a long time. i recently relapsed and have an evaluation with a treatment center back home different from the first treatment center in a few weeks. my weight is better than it was before my first round of treatment but overall i have recently lost a significant amount of weight according to my dietician. i m hoping the new center will take me but of course i m stressing about whether i m sick enough to get a spot there. i m trying to eat as much as i can to prepare but it s a constant battle in my head. does anyone have advice for this stage of recovery?,

struggling in recovery vs relapse. i ve been in recovery for just over two and a half years and noticed that recently i ve been having more disordered thoughts and a harder time with food. i ve seen my doctor and i was really taken by surprise that they ve decided to refer me to secondary care services on an outpatient basis rather than a primary care setting. i feel like a fraud or that i ve failed my recovery attempt. it feels important to me to not break my streak as i was really proud of myself for being in recovery for 2 years after being unwell for 1 years. guess i was just wondering how people define relapses since recovery isn t linear ?,

"screwed up by going back and forth in recovery. trying to get back on track. so my dumbass started faltering as early as 1.5 months into recovery. i had extreme mental hunger and gained weight very quickly yes some of it was water but a lot was real weight and it did slow down as i got closer to my set weight range. but i was appalled at how much i was eating and how much that i gained in a short amount of time that i really thought i screwed up recovery and just had bed. the fact that my eh was entirely mental did not help. my physical hunger cues were barely present until i was almost weight restored. it did and still makes me feel invalid. anyways looking back i was definitely still malnourished bc every time i tried to restrict i would immediately get so hungry i would be in physical pain and have low blood sugar. but i thought eating so much just screwed my body up or something idk. i got caught in a bad cycle of restricting, then realizing anorexia isn t worth it, then when i decided to eat again it would be a relatively normal amount for a day or two, but then i d have an inevitable binge that would scare me off into restriction again. there was a brief period where i was eating pretty normally and maintaining my pre ed weight for a couple weeks, but then i had a crazy binge week out of nowhere this was when i got my period back and i overshot as a result and i felt horrible about myself and went back to restricting and the cycle continued. if i could just accept the extra weight on my body and not freak out and immediately go back to restricting i could actually make progress. but i had preconceived ideas in my head that if i overshot then i failed recovery which i now know is not true at all but at this point i do not care about my weight. i just want be well. i would rather have overshoot weight than be trapped in the never ending binge purge restrict cycle. i never used to make myself throw up, but this week i ve b ped 3 times and i know it can t go on any longer. as much as my brain tells me going back to anorexia will fix things i know it won t, it s literally what started all of these problems in the first place. i kept trying to rush recovery bc i wanted to be in a good place when i went back to school in the fall but now i m gonna have to take the semester off to sort myself out. i feel like such a failure but having any responsibilities on me right now stresses me out and makes me want to rush recovery which just ends up making things worse. i would keep trying to go back to restriction bc it feels like a quick solution in the moment but ik long term it s not sustainable. ik people are quick to say recovery binges are just extreme hunger but i really do think going back and forth in recovery has made me develop bed bulimia tendencies. bc sometimes i will eat until satisfaction but i ll be bloated and feel so guilty that i ll purge and then it turns into a b p session when i could ve just sat with the discomfort of an extra few hundred calories and moved on with my life instead of binging on thousands upon thousands. i think at this point i need to get rid of all responsibilities and be 1 focused on my recovery. but i feel like such a clown. other people can recover while working and doing college and i can t. it stresses me out too much. it s only been 4 months but it feels like it s been ages somehow and like i ve tried every approach in the book and come up unsuccessful every time. i can t believe it s taken me this long to realize that i let my unrealistic expectations completely fuck up my recovery and i m upset with myself. i m struggling to figure out how to move on from here. i m thinking of doing outpatient treatment but my brain loves to gaslight me into thinking that i don t need it bc i am unable to restrict successfully even though restriction isn t the only ed behavior and i m clearly a mess right now. my dabble into bulimic behaviors has further screwed up my fullness cues and i just want normal hunger signals. i m just mad at myself for being so stupid and trying to cope with the discomfort of recovery through unsustainable behaviors.",
hypocritical bf. long story short.. my 32f boyfriend 39m of 12 years constantly says he loves my body.. that i m not fat. then today he comes home from dinner with a friend he hasn t seen in while and the only way he can describe him is that he s gotten chunky he s a fat boy . so why does he think he can call other people fat but expect me to believe him when he says i m not. this kills the progress i ve made in therapy and recovery.,

"day 3 of going all in. today started of well, but in went downhill a bit in the evening. had my usual breakfast of cereal and a sandwich. i'm still not pouring myself a big bowl of cereal though. i keep sticking to a small bowl that i don't even fill up all the way.. but i'll get there then, at work, my boss brought some cake to thank us for managing things while she was on vacation for three weeks. i wanted some, i was so busy that i couldn't take a break. and when i had to leave for school, i was in a hurry to catch the bus. but maybe i'll get to have some tomorrow, they probably didn't finish all of it. before school, i bought a protein pudding i was very close to buying a regular one, but i chickened out ; ; and a salad. and i used all of the dressing : big moment for me. i had to eat both of it quickly before class. and a classmate commented on me eating by asking ""are you hungry?"" and i'm not sure how she meant it, but it made me feel bad... still, i was doing fine. i wasn't bloated all day, which made me feel a lot more comfortable in my body. today i got to cook dinner since my mom had to work late. i threw together a pasta dish from leftovers, like mushrooms, beans and green peppers from our garden, garlic and some meat. it was good, but not very filling. i had a banana immediately afterwards and my physical hunger was satisfied. but then mental hunger kicked in. i was craving something sweet. i waited two hours, still craving something sweet. so i made myself another small bowl of cereal. still craving something sweet. i had these taiyaki waffles with custard filling lying around. i decided to eat one. but it didn't satisfy me, so without giving myself any time to think about it, i ate the other two i had left as well. and then the guilt came creeping in. i feel like i lost control, like i binged. i tried exercising for a bit but quickly realized that i'm too tired. so i took a shower and now i'm in bed, trying to make myself feel better by writing about it. i'll go to bed after this. i'm trying to reason with myself. my other meals weren't that big, the snacks i had after dinner made up for it, right? all in all, it was a normal amount, right? not too much, not too little... i know there is no ""too much"" in all in recovery. i should be eating more. after all, i haven't made much progress by sticking to the same things for months. i had to change something. and i'll just have to keep going. today didn't end the way i wanted it to. but that's okay. there's always tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. i'm glad to still be here to see tomorrow. there will be no tomorrow if i go back to restricting. so i'll fight. for more tomorrow's to come.",
"relapse and high cholesterol. so i kinda sorta relapsed because recovery was making me suicidal since my ed is a coping mechanism. anyways, i just got my blood test results back from the doctor, and my cholesterol levels are super high? even though i avoid dietary fats like the plague? my doctor told me to stop eating fatty foods and eat more veggies fruits and lean meats i was like girl all i eat is tht. i never had an issue with high cholesterol before restriction, so i know it s not genetic. literally what is wrong with my body",
"challenged myself and had takeout for lunch . sorry to post twice in one day but i ordered indian takeout butter chicken, rice , naan, and a samosa for lunch today because i couldn't stop thinking about it for literal days, and i was ready to pull the trigger on actually starting recovery, so i did it and i ate the whole thing and i can't believe i did it was delicious, indian food is one of my favorite cuisines. i thought i would feel terrible afterwards but honestly i just feel shocked. feeling full for once is weird and a little uncomfortable. i feel like today will be a rollercoaster of emotions but the fact that i'm not hysterical and panicking right now is a win, and the fact that i was brave enough to order the takeout i was craving and eat the whole thing is huge for me, even if i feel guilty and terrible i know deep down it was the right thing to do. i'm proud of myself for finally challenging my ed, i just hope i can try to be consistent going forward and not stay stuck in quasi relapse.",
"struggling in recovery . third full day of all in and i skipped breakfast i thought that deleting my calorie counting app would make it easier to not restrict but i m still doing it. i wake up and am just not hungry and than by the time i do get hungry it s too close to lunch so i don t even bother. spending a good half hour mindlessly scrolling through edtwt definitely didn t help. i want the rest of today to be better, though. we re going to one of my favourite restaurants to get ramen for lunch sidebar but it s so weird how few ramen restaurants do a vegetarian ramen that actually uses tofu as a meat substitute instead of just having a bunch of vegetables in a bowl with soup and maybe i ll get a nice dessert in chinatown as well, or bubble tea if it gets hot out. and maybe go to a farmer s market this evening hopefully there s at least one bakery booth that does pizza buns because i could really go for one. and i suddenly want something orange flavoured as well not sure what tho if you read all of this than thank you, have a nice day, go ahead and get that snack you want that your ed is telling you that you can t have.",

"struggling in recovery. ok to start off i m 22, non binary, and i ve been in treatment since mid april of this year withdrew from college , shit was pretty bad . started off in residential, and i have been in iop for almost three weeks now but i m being stepped up to php again tomorrow. i have been doing really poorly ever since i left php in the first place, so i can t say i wasn t anticipating the step up, but i still hate it. here s where i m struggling a lot though. so i haven t known my weight since the day i went to residential, and it s definitely best this way. i think most of my weight restoration happened during the 7 weeks i was in res, but definitely not fully. then it slowed down a lot, and the last i heard from my dietitian last week i was very close to being fully weight restored. i suspect now that if anything, i m a bit further away if not exactly where i was last week because i have been finding it so difficult to meet my meal plan, especially without the accountability of being in php. however being in iop for the last few weeks, i have definitely allowed my ed brain to occupy a lot more of my thoughts, and i am also really struggling with hunger cues. there is also just something about being fully weight restored that makes my ed scream at me and frankly just makes me want to jump off a cliff. so i am falling back into old habits to avoid that. and i am scared that even with the extra support of php and the extra supplementation i will just fail to complete and then i really don t know what they re gonna do with me put me back in res? pls no anyways yeah i am really struggling with the thought of no longer deserving to eat my meal plan bc if i am so close to being weight restored i m obviously at a healthy weight already. i wish i could just tell my ed to shut the fuck up. this is really hard and idk what to do",

"i don't believe in being fully recovered... thoughts?. imo eds are a lot like being an alcoholic or drug user. you're always ""in recovery"" even if you haven't had a drink in 3 years because there are inherent differences between yourself and a non sufferer which you will always have to guard yourself against. for example an alcoholic will never be able to just binge drink on a random saturday one time like maybe a normie can and continue with their lives without it impacting them whatsoever and having no ramifications. so someone in ed recovery, even if they've been recovered for decades will never be able to go on a normie crazy crash diet which again isn't healthy for anyone, like binge drinking isn't, but the normie can bounce back and eat a bacon sandwich the day after and not care they will never be able to engage in those behaviours without risking a relapse. i have always found the standard of ""fully recovered"" to be really discouraging and just another thing that would drive my perfectionism nuts. i see it all the time in this sub... people who still struggle with certain thoughts or behaviours despite trying really hard to recover, sometimes for years, coming for advice, and simply being told along the lines of ""you aren't fully recovered. try harder."" which isn't helpful and makes even less sense under the view that recovery is a lifelong process. in my case during the most recovered period of my life, still having thoughts just made me relapse in the end because i'd done so much work and i still wasn't the mystical ""fully recovered"" everyone preaches about so what was the point?",

feel secure in recovery but intrusive thoughts r still there. the thoughts being about how i should exercise or be smaller. it s frustrating and it rlly lowers my mood and makes me feel depressed. i m going to talk to my psychiatrist about this tmrw. my dietician told me i need to just let those thoughts exist and not act on them or anything. i of course know these thoughts r irrational and i don t want to go back to restriction because i don t want to put my body through that anymore i really don t. and i ve realized how natural and normal eating is that i can t imagine not eating regularly. idk what the point of this is. i guess i m just tired of my body image depressing me ?,
how do you navigate through being in a relationship during recovery ed struggles?. i ve found myself having the lowest of lows ever since starting ed recovery amongst few proud moments of course too and wanting to isolate myself. my boyfriend knows that i m pursuing recovery and is really supportive. he knows a bit about what s going in for me and i feel the need to share with him the full extent as to what i m going through but i think it s just my ed brain feeling the need to explain myself because on the outside it s telling me i m not sick enough despite being underweight and even though i know how much of an emotional toll this is taking on me. i feel kind of insecure being in a relationship knowing that the other person knows very been diagnosed with an because that voice in my head keeps telling me you don t look sick which i know is fucked but something that plays in my mind. anyway. i guess i m just looking to hear some experiences for navigating through talking to your partner or other relationships about your ed.,
"day 2 of going all in. someone left a comment saying they're interested in my journey, so i might make this a daily thing : it helps me sort out my thoughts as well. amp; x2 b; so, today i woke up extremely bloated and hungry again. i had a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast, as well as some blueberries and a banana. but i was still hungry, at least mentally. so i ended up having my lunch, which consisted of a sandwich with cucumber, cream cheese and tomato some cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers on the side, as well. now here is where i made some progress: before going all in, i would have thought ""well, i already ate the lunch i made for work, so i won't poack anything else."" but today i stopped by a nearby bakery to get a bread roll before i got to work. i ate at lunch. and here comes another win: i had two cookies with my coffee at lunch. my coworkers keep bringing food to work i know they're doing it for me and i'm always tempted to have some, but never accept it. but i mustered up the courage to have those cookies : after what ended up being an 11 hour shift, i got home and had dinner, which was bbq again. i had chicken breast with cucumber salad and some baguette. it was a prepackaged cucumber salad and those kinds of salads used to be a big fear, but i'm slowly getting comfortable with them. we still have lots of baguette left, so i snacked on some while preparing my lunch for tomorrow. and i was craving ice cream, so i had some as well. another win : it was one of those ice cream sandwiches that are half waffle, half covered in chocolate. it used to be my favorite, but i started to fear it because of the calories. today was my second time challenging it. i had been making compromises by having lower calorie ice creams, but not anymore. my bloating is still very intense and today i'm having a negative body image. i'm trying to figure out whether i had enough today or if i should eat something else. i'm satisfied for now. when i got something extra for lunch, i was fighting with myself. thinking that i'm eating too much today. but having written all of it down, it doesn't sound like a lot. hmm... amp; x2 b; tomorrow i'll have work, then a break and then school i'm a dentist's assistant in training and here in germany you get training by work place experience and by going to a school specifically accustomed to your field of work . i have a long break to have enough time to get to school. i'm thinking about stopping by at a cafe to get some pastry or cake. to celebrate going all in. i hope i can muster up the courage. it'll be the first day after summer break and i'm starting my second year now. i'm a bit disappointed that i haven't made much progress over the past 6 weeks... but it can only go up from here amp; x2 b; that's it for today : ",
"making others aware of what is helpful or harmful to say to someone with an ed. hello there, so i ve recently opened up to a couple of friends and my mum about my relapse and they ve all been great at listening and being supportive. one thing though is that sometimes people will say things, and while i know that they mean no harm my ed brain will run with it and skew it. i am pretty aware of fatphobia, my own internalised weight bias and how diet culture, the thin ideal and orthorexic tendancies are just normal for a lot of people, so maybe i m overly sensitive. but i ve been thinking about putting a little list together for my mum and maybe 1 2 friends of how seemingly innocent comments can just stick in my brain. some examples: being invited to dinner a party: don t worry, you don t have to eat anything gt; others expect me not to eat don t worry you won t become fat overweight gt; if i do gain and become overweight, that would be bad or when i told my mum that i was so hungry today and bought a cheese croissant on the go for which i felt massively guilty why did you get that crap when you could have gotten two bananas? gt; i m only allowed healthy food. do you guys think that s a good idea?",

"i have apparently never honored purely mental hunger and i don't know how to do it.. my hunger cues went away a little over a month ago when i got covid. y'all had helpful advice https: www.reddit.com r fuckeatingdisorders comments w8uapy struggling to get back on track after covid about that which aligned with my rd's recommendation to go back to doing mechanical eating for a while until i'm used to eating throughout the day again. i met with my rd again to talk through this more, because i'm really struggling with feeling like i have permission to eat when i don't feel physical hunger in my stomach. when i was experiencing extreme hunger, i basically treated that as my permission to eat, and then when i got sick and my hunger cues faded, so did my permission. and as we talked about other ways your body sends hunger signals besides your stomach rumbling, it kind of forced me to realize and admit that i have completely refused to honor mental hunger throughout my entire recovery process. if i have a thought about food or a craving to taste something, i have thus far been ignoring it unless until it lined up with feeling hunger in my stomach. i just don't understand how to go about this. i've always interpreted thoughts about food or taste cravings to be an emotional trigger, like that it's what you experience if you use food to cope with your feelings. but my rd says that's not true, and that those are signals that i need to eat. i just don't know how to feel okay with honoring cravings for something calorie dense like a milkshake when i'm not feeling physically hungry. last night i made one to try to honor it but i stopped after 2 3 sips because it just felt wrong to have it when i didn't feel like i was starving. it probably doesn't help that after wanting so many milkshakes throughout my extreme hunger period that i basically interpret a craving for them as ""your body is telling you to gain weight"" which is really upsetting. i was back at my pre ed weight right before i got covid, and then between that and the relapsing i've been struggling with ever since, my weight's been going back down and i've been interpreting it as my body telling me i could be done now and didn't need to weigh so much anymore. my rd says that's probably not true, but that i don't necessarily have to weight restore again if i can get back on track with eating enough and my weight stays the same. i realize i'm doing a combination of overthinking, self shaming, restricting, and using the size of my body to determine the valid criteria i have to meet in order to eat. i just don't know how to overcome this, or to believe even that it's something i do need to overcome.",

"struggling in recovery. hey guys. im going to try and not mention anything that may be triggering, i just need to vent and hopefully receive some advice words of comfort. i ve struggled with an eating disorder for over a year now, and i was diagnosed with anorexia 5 months ago. i was recently in paris, where for a month i guess i just let myself go and ate what i wanted. i told myself that i wouldn t restrict myself and that all the walking would make it okay. i gained around 1 lbs. i got home, feeling fine, and excited for the rest of the summer. i spent a weekend with family where i ate a lot. i feel very guilty about it. i weighed myself today and i am 4 lbs heavier. so here i am, so anxious and scared over the possibility that i got that much heavier in one weekend. i feel scared and unsafe. i feel like i m in some sort of danger. i don t fit into some of my clothes anymore, and it s making me want to relapse. my thoughts won t stop and it is genuinely torturous. i don t want to ruin august for myself by worrying about food and i also don t want to hate the way i look and feel awful. but at this point it s too late. i wish i could be happy again. i got myself into such a mess developing this disorder that im so afraid i ll never see the light at the end of the tunnel. i want to be comfortable with myself but the little girl who didn t care about her large thighs is long gone. i ve been overeating these past few days and i just feel like i ve gained more weight than i should ve. i am no longer underweight which is good but i just feel like people will judge me . i don t look the way i used to. i don t look the way i could have.",

"eating the whole pack of cookies ant still restricting. i realize i was doing a micro restricton. i'm all in, and that means giving me the freedom to eat a packet of cookies, or chocolate, of chips if i want to. but still eating a packet of something and knowing its grams makes me feel safe, or rather, it makes my ed feel safe. "" oh yeah, i am eating 1 grams of this, or 9 grams of x"" i want to remind you that there may also be restrictions, even if you feel like you eat a lot. what i did to get out of this restriction was to put all the cookies in the same box and throw away the packaging. that way, i can eat as much as i want, and with more variety for me its a win or win situation",

"dealing w shaming. i moved from the west coast to the middle of the country, and the amount of appearance related bullying i've been dealing with went up by a lot. smaller bodies are very uncommon here, but they were very common in my home state. nutrition knowledge and wellness culture is also less popular, and i think that is strongly related. i am recovered. i am. i don't relate much to the younger me who would starve, count every single calorie, compare my body to everyone else's, etc. i'm on the opposite end of the spectrum kinda now i'm trying to gain muscle mass and increase endurance so i can be a hiking, sparring, rock climbing machine. i truly believe i'm doing okay with food, and no doctors have been upset with my weight in a few years. but...the bullying is getting to me and making me feel like i need to relapse to be liked. i started at a new job and was so excited about my coworkers and jazzed to make some new friends. but they kept asking ""what size do you wear? like, what size pants? really? oh....no reason . : "" and ""do you even put sugar in your coffee? oh, you like caramel? lol its probably the sugar free"" and ""i could throw you across the room. "" and i tried to address it with my manager, but she was the main commenter and she just said ""pfft. well, you are skinny."" i opened up to her about having an ed and that the comments make it harder, and she just went ""ok, so? so do i. a lot of people do. "" i explained that i understand that and that's why i don't comment on food people eat or their bodies ever, and i would really like if i could get the same...especially at work. it never stopped and eventually i was fired for repeatedly pulling my manager to the back to tell her ""no, you can't talk to me like this"". i am so confused. i don't understand why they were so mean to me and insisted to me that i'm a skeleton. i have body dysmorphia, so i can't just look in a mirror and know they're wrong. i've had to check myself with 3 doctors, every friend i have, a few internet strangers, and i'm still paranoid that i secretly look like a paperclip and nobody will tell me. my sources suggested my presence exacerbates an insecurity that they have, and that's where the cruelty is coming from. or it's that they're so unused to seeing athletic bodies that their perception is skewed. but that's hard to believe. is anyone else experiencing this or have any perspective to share?",

"first week of recovery in the books, but i still have a lot of questions.. hello, i posted in this sub around a week ago and shared my experience with an ed. in short, i have a super restricted diet due to health issues and also created these dumb restrictive tendencies in my head such as restricted feeding windows and just general food restriction. on top of this, i live a super active lifestyle triathlon and weightlifting . this led to a viscous cycle of binging and restricting followed by periods of over exercise and a generally bad relationship with food. i finally decided that i was fed up and sought out the help of a registered dietician as well as opening up to my therapist and psychiatrist i kept them out of the loop . the past week has been very eye opening. i have been eating fully unrestricted and i have cut down on exercise by like 75 . i have been avoiding the scale, but i know i ve already gained a decent amount of weight which i m personally okay with at this point. what s really getting to me is what i perceive as extreme hunger. i don t know if i should listen to the voice in my head telling me to eat everything because i feel like i d literally eat all day. also, i m struggling to validate my extreme hunger because although i was slightly underweight i wasn t anorexic or anything. i d still eat a lot of food on a daily basis because i had to supplement my training, but i still restricted a lot. should i really just keep listening to my brain and eat whatever i want and hope that this will eventually go away? my mental hunger is still very prevalent. i can be so physically full but my brain will say it s not done. i guess i m just having a hard time navigating this whole thing and would like to hear some others experience. thanks for reading and take care.",
i m hungry and it s making me soo anxious. i ve been high restricting again for a few months now with only 2 3 days not in line with my calorie limit so i know it makes sense that i m hungry but i m so scared of this feeling. i ve eaten something mor than i usually do up to lunch time and it s still here and i m at work and anxious and just want to throw a tantrum. i ve been toying with the idea of having a refeeding day just to calm my body and nerves. but it feels wrong doing so without anyone else with me to justify it. on the other hand all the past days i ve spent with others i ve been able to stay under my limit. when my ed first came around disguised as fit and healthy lifestyle ofc i used to have these diet breaks every two weeks or so relatively guilt free. but now it s so daunting : but i feel like maybe it s a step i should take as in harm reduction? it s driving me insane today i feel like a black hole,

"my 67 year old mother has untreated disordered eating and it is really fucking with our relationship. i was diagnosed with having disordered eating issues and body dysmorphia in the process of going back to therapy a couple years ago. it's so obvious now looking back, but i never realized that my sisters' severe anorexia and my seriously disordered eating habits stemmed so greatly from my mothers' own issues. this is a tale as old as time for mothers and daughters, i'm sure. at this point, i'd say i'm in a state of recovery. my relationship with my self image is becoming more positive and i'm far less distressed and preoccupied by weight and food. my mother came to visit me a month ago and her disordered eating issues were extremely distressing to me. to some degree i have heightened awareness about her issues now, but i also believe they have worsened and i don't know how to deal with it. she's lost probably 3 pounds since i saw her for christmas. every moment of her five days with me revolved around food: if we weren't talking about near future eating, we were talking about what she does or doesn't eat, the weight she's losing ""i lost two pounds after we came back from our vacation"" , and how proud she is of the little she eats ""i realized i can eat half as many of the olives i like on my salad every day, i really don't need the calories"" . it got so under my skin and was so triggering for me. it brought back so many feelings of resentment i experienced early in therapy when i was processing all the hurtful things my mom said to me growing up about my body, the fact that my disordered eating and self harm cries for help went unnoticed by my parents because my sister had full blown anorexia, how my binge eating in secret habit probably developed from being judged and shamed by my mom for eating, and how my obsession with diets is because of their presence on a pedestal in my home. i'm 28 and my parents aren't young. our relationship was strained growing up and i want to improve my relationship with my parents so they don't die completely estranged from me. i know i can't be my mom's therapist but i don't know how i can tolerate being in a relationship with her because of how harmful and triggering her own issues are to me.",
"laughing while crying in the mcdonald s drive thru and some wins. i had an epiphany recently. i am ready to recover. this sub made me realize i was never recovered and my ed has been controlling my life for a decade now. i m through. i decided that while maybe not all in is for me, i am ready to put a stop to this madness. i broke down sobbing earlier today once again to my poor husband who reassured me there is nothing to apologize for and he s proud of me for taking these hard steps. i am just letting myself feel all of these awful uncomfortable feelings and letting myself cry and be miserable and uncomfortable. we are both prepared for a lot of eating and crying in the coming months. i m so uncomfortable with letting myself eat and feeling extreme hunger, but i m doing my best to lean into the discomfort. the disordered part of me had every intention of restricting today after last night and going for my long run this morning. fortunately it was insanely too hot for my run today, so that forced me to rest and my hunger is very much extreme today so restriction was not happening. i ate my safe breakfast and could not ignore my blaring hunger cues so i ended up eating 2 chocolate bars and some mega stuffed oreos so good . we had to leave for a gathering and i wasn t hungry at this point so i didn t eat at the gathering, but i no longer felt full so something possessed me to ask my husband to stop at mcdonald s on the way home. literally crying while laughing in the drive thru as i ordered a large fry, 2 cheeseburgers, 1 piece nugget with honey and honey mustard and a large frozen coke. i honestly felt like i had been possessed. i didn t think i even knew what i wanted until i started ordering. my husband reassuringly squeezed my thigh and said i m listening to my body and my body is hungry as he urged me to eat one of my cheeseburgers on the way home. i m so grateful that my husband has only ever said anything about my weight when i am on the lower end of healthy when expressing his concern for my health. i know he truly wants me to be healthy both mentally and physically and that is going to help fuel my recovery. i want to enjoy my marriage. i want to enjoy and live my life with my husband. i don t want ed to be a third party in my marriage any longer. it has been for far too long. i also unfollowed r edanonymous and edanonymousmemes because i realize now it s becoming a cesspool of people too deeply disordered and they just want to justify their disordered thoughts and behaviors and constant reassurance they can forever maintain a sick body and mind and that is not conducive to my recovery. and the last win for the day was finding a couple of ed dietitians online covered by my insurance one of which looks like a real person not low end of healthy bmi recovered, just a normal person which i think is what i need. as i said i m not ready or feel like all in is compatible with me, but i am ready to start taking recovery seriously and working with an ed rd and coming up with a recovery meal plan that i can follow. i m proud of myself today. and also exhausted. who knew eating is so exhausting, lmao. my mcdonald s was delicious btw.",

"i gave into my eh again last night and i m trying to identify my feelings today. and it wasn t even anything extreme. i had three large scoops of real ice cream from my favorite ice cream shop, 4 oreos, and my leftover grilled chicken from the mexican restaurant i barely touched, so totaling about 3, calories for the day. i feel like my body really did take over and i was glad it did. i realized i feel happy when i am eating. i feel like i can genuinely laugh again when i m eating after i eat. i feel relief . i don t care about being alone while actually eating. it doesn t feel like some sick ritual. i feel such profound relief. restricting and constantly depriving my body of food is not easy. it s insanely hard. it takes so much from me, including my ability to experience real joy. when i finally let myself really eat, life doesn t feel empty. when i am restricting, i feel perpetually irritable and exhausted. but the feelings i experience the next day are hard to shake and i end up right back where i started. the shame. the guilt. the self hatred. the nonstop body checking. and for what? because i ate? why do i feel so disgusted with myself when my limbs feel a little larger? why do i feel so disgusted and unworthy when i don t feel tiny? when i can feel the weight of food in my body? will that sensation ever not make my skin crawl? i struggled with body dysmorphic disorder long before i developed a full blown eating disorder. i ve always had these awful thoughts that are tied to my weight and the way i look. but i don t know how to just let them go. i know deep down they no longer serve me. they never have. i am working hard these last few weeks to challenge myself and these thoughts. i m sick of listening to this voice. i hate trying to recover in a world that is beyond obsessed with diet culture and fighting off literally any ounce of fat. demonizing it. i am just so tired of people being praised for losing weight and people whispering how he she let themselves go when they gain weight. i m just so tired of our thoughts being controlled by diet culture. it makes it feel like recovery is wrong. something i ve realized is that many people i know, are actually much better off mentally and they don t fit society s toxic diet culture expectations. virtually everyone i know in a smaller body is not healthy mentally or physically. especially mentally. and those i know in larger bodies still exercise because they enjoy it and it s not about weight loss and they eat enjoy vegetables and fruit. what a concept i just want to get to a point where i am truly happy in my body, where feeling and seeing excess fat doesn t send me spiraling. where i don t feel like i need to wear jackets on hot summer days. i m trying to sit with the discomfort today. i gt; didn t take laxatives last night to eliminate the food and water weight lt; so i guess that s a small win. i m fighting the urge to go for my run. i m trying so hard. i feel like i am trying so hard to separate myself from my ed. there is a part of me somewhere deep inside that wants out of this hellscape. i can t maintain this body forever at the expense of my mental health. at the expense of my life.",

"i don t even wanna recover atp. i ve been in anorexia recovery for about a year or so now? it started as medical anorexia but very quickly developed into anorexia nervosa. i try to eat, but every time i do, no matter what i eat, i feel like shit. my stomach hurts, i get acid reflux, i m nauseous and i already deal with functional nausea and emetophobia so that s cool . i know it s gonna take baby steps and recovery takes forever but i just don t see a point. i m so miserable now, no matter what i do, that i m just at my breaking point. anyone else go through this in recovery? any tips or tricks?",

"2 weeks to gain weight. im feeling such a mix of emotions right now and its crazy. im supposed to move to college in two weeks, but in order for my doctor to medically clear me i need to gain gt; 1 lt; more pounds, which is a bit scary for me as it would put me slightly higher then my pre ed weight. i understand that my pre ed weight was when i was like 15, and it makes sense i would need to be above that as im 19 now but its hard to wrap my head around fully. this past week has been a little rough in terms of a slight slip i wouldn't quite call it a relapse but , and im trying to pull myself out of it. and to be honest, i haven't really been in recovery, its more along the lines of quasi recovery. i want to be able to get past this, to go all in or whatever and ive tried in the past but i always give up after like a day. i think the scariest thought for me about going all in is that i may gain more weight then my doctor said. does anyone have any tips for moving out of quasi recovery into all in?",
"flip flopping between wanting recovery and relapsing. i m trying so hard in recovery right now but stupidly i decided to weigh myself and i ve gained 7 lbs. i don't know how much of that is real because i'd eaten a huge breakfast didn't pee had clothes on drank something fizzy it's only been 2 3 weeks but it still put me at a number i just wasn't ready to see. so i cried all morning and wallowed in the upset and i planned a relapse. what i would eat, how i would lie to those around me, how i would avoid food. i have such a thing about how my legs look as well so i compared photos of them today to pictures from before i started recovery and cried even more. i don't want to upset my mum and see her the way she was when i was sick. she cares so much and i feel horrible for what i put her through with this illness but i just can't. if this little weight gain can regress me so badly i'm clearly just not ready to recover. if i keep eating and shovelling food in my mouth regardless of the thoughts i know it's just gonna give them more volume and eventually fuel a relapse. i just need support, i just want someone to tell me why it s even worth it to recover. i cant believe my self hatred runs so deep that i put myself through this",
you can t possibly have an ed your weight and blood results are normal. so tired of hearing this when my weight shifts back and forth and i struggle daily. and the lack of resources for help for those with normal blood results.,
"weight restoration tw: exercise mentioned . i've been reading about the weight restoration process and i understand that to reach your set point weight, the body needs to restore its fat free mass. since weight strength training increases your muscle mass and bone density, would that speed the process up? or since it would create a caloric deficit and put the body under some stress, would that just make things worse?",

"already excited for holidays, huge win in my recovery?. i feel a bit stupid for being so excited for the holidays, since we're still in the middle of summer, but i see this as good progress in my recovery : like, i'm looking forward to halloween and autumn, i want to bake pumpkin pie and throw a halloween sleepover with my friends. then, for christmas season, i want to bake cookies once a week, i want to be excited every time i open another door of my advent calender. then comes my birthday, on the 21st. my 21st birthday. it's my lucky birthday, right? i haven't properly celebrated my birthday in forever. and my 2 th birthday was one of the most depressing days in my life. i didn't let myself enjoy it at all. so this year, i want to spoil myself. i'll bake a huge cake for myself and i will have a huge slice of it : it'll be the cake younger me dreamed of. christmas celebrations will follow soon after and i won't skim out on christmas dinner with my family. and for new year's eve, i'll celebrate my choice to go into recovery. my choice to keep living. amp; x2 b; what does scare me a bit is that i might have unrealistic expectations. what if it won't be as nice as i'm imagining? no one else around me makes a big deal out of holidays. and for my last birthday, it felt like everyone forgot. no one cared. is it too selfish of me to expect a big celebration? i felt so insignificant that day. and i'm scared that this year won't be any different. but if i told my family and friends what i expect from my birthday celebrations, it would come off as demanding. all those recovery influencers have amazing birthday celebrations. i guess i'm jealous... i want to have something nice for once. a day dedicated to myself. i'm starting to think, that maybe i too am deserving of having a nice day. first step to self love maybe? i've been dropping some hints on what kind of presents i'd want to receive. nothing specific. i just want to feel like someone thought of me for once. last year, my friends gifted me a gift card and a huge bar of chocolate that i was too scared to eat because of my ed. it felt like they didn't even try. and then i felt horrible about myself for thinking that way. what if this year won't be any different? it'll be a huge setback for me. it'll just reinforce the idea that i'm not important, that i'm not special and that everyone would be better off without me. but i don't want to think of that right now. i'll make the best of it.",
having a life with eh. how do you guys can have a normal life with eh? like i didn't do much those past 2 weeks. i had summer break and could focus completely on eating and healing. but now i have to start learning for my exams and i don't know how to handle studying and eh at once. i try not to stress myself but somehow my extreme hunger got huge in the past days so all i can focus on while studying is food even when i have just eaten or have food constantly right next to me while learning. it feels like there isn't any space in my head except for sleeping and food. but it's just like that when i'm learning. practicing hobbies or short social events are fine. did you experience it as well? how do you cope with that?,
"are there physical consequences of quasi recovery?. so when i initially developed my ed i dieted down to about 15 2 pounds below my set point and by then i realized my mind was completely fucked up and i had no idea what to do so i sort of entered quasi recovery where i ate 18 22 cals bc that seemed to be what every girl on tiktok ate to maintain. but i was so anxious of going over that amount and basically never allowed myself to and constantly watched what i ate and it sucked. now that i m at my set point i eat more like 3 but it seems like most people eat around 2 cals if not less anyways. so in terms of physical health i don t really see what was wrong with me staying in quasi bc i ate enough . basically my ed has been giving me a hard time for not staying in quasi recovery. mentally it was hell bc i wasn t making much progress with tackling the ed thoughts and i eventually relapsed harder into restriction as a result but what are the physical repercussions of staying in a slightly suppressed body weight? i wasn t drastically below my set point, i was getting my period for a couple months, the only things that were really compromised were my digestion and heart rate and even then they weren t terribly slow. i m just wondering if it would actually be physically harmful for me to be slightly under my set point. i m not defending quasi by any means bc i was miserable but i have a hard time taking myself seriously if i wasn t actually harming my physical health. when i was in that stage i wanted for gain the weight back so i could have food freedom and stop being obsessed with food but it feels like a sad excuse to gain weight..",

"just had the worst therapy intake of my life. the therapist asked me to show her my collarbone on video she could only see my face initially and said that it didn't look that bad, so i can't have a real ed and my weight was was fine. i don't know whether to laugh or cry edited to add: thanks everyone for your support this was unfortunately a ""try talking to this random therapist known by an acquaintance"" situation, so i really have no one to report this to. thankfully i have been in treatment before and know that this is wrong. take care everyone lt;3",

"curious about how many recovered people do naturally maintain a low bmi. i posted in another ed sub how it s really triggering and makes recovery really difficult for me to hear from ed dietitians and therapists how full recovery is possible when they themselves are evidently somehow maintaining a low bmi and wearing fitness trackers, etc. when i did php years ago, the group leaders were allowed to eat salads at meal time while some of us myself included were crying over bread i know it s not logical but non low cal bread is a fear food for me . i know bmi is super flawed and basically bull, and really don t think it s natural to maintain a low end of healthy bmi effortlessly. many disagree. and like i have previously said, i m trying to challenge my own internalized fatphobia. i know that it is a shit ton of work for me to maintain a bmi of gt; 18 19 lt; and i haven t actually been able to go lower because my body simply will not allow it. i naturally have a lot of muscle and i m basically built like a quarter horse so my body absolutely hangs onto that muscle even when i am underweight from a clinical standpoint. looking back on my medical chart, my weight was stable at bmi of gt; 21.5 22.5 lt; pre ed. and i am sure there may be some people out there who do just happen to maintain a low weight without even trying. but in an ed recovery space? how realistic is that? i don t want reassurance that should i decide to make a full recovery that my bmi will just magically stay on low end of healthy because like i said, my body will not allow it and myself and my sisters and my mother are all built the same. i m just curious to know everyone s thoughts on this because this is a primarily recovery oriented sub. but it makes it hard to trust therapists and dietitians who clearly still seem to be disordered.",
"it ain t much but it s a start. fuck me i did it; instead of waiting till night time i just got the box of cereal and started eating, then i had some granola cuz i wanted it. after that i had pretzels and cashews i did this at like 4:3 and it felt so good to eat that food it tasted so good and yea i ate a shit ton of the cereal but i didn t not stop eating at all like i eventually stopped so that fear of never stopping eating is irrational i know it s not a whole lot but it s progress. this is the start of my recovery i am stating that to be held accountable",
"feeling free from my ed. i reached weight restoration and have been holding steady for a while. one of the first posts on the subreddit, i was still in the early stages of recovery and scared. i remembered when i made that post that i was sobbing about my extreme hunger and absolutely fucking terrified of gaining. yet i wanted to get better and damn, i got a lot better. i never thought i'd get this far in recovery. i went out and had bread, fries, and pie in one day and didn't panic or cry about it. i thought i'd be stuck in this bullshit til i dropped dead and i'm absolutely proud. even when i had to man up and ditch my sick clothes, or when i dealt with extreme hunger four days straight and eating exclusively peanut butter, yogurt, bagels, and pizza. i didn't realize how far i came til now and how i was able to enjoy eating out. honestly, i have been dealing with disordered eating, before anorexia got my ass. i wanted to lose weight at 15, so i started, you know, up chucking spiraled into exclusive restriction. by 18, i was sick, underweight, and controlled by anorexia. i almost died last year. became so underweight, with an irregular heartbeat, i could barely walk. i tried to eat, experienced extreme hunger, and then developed anorexia, b p edition. ruined my life to the point that i had to move back with parents and again, ceased nutritional intake. at that point, i was told i either needed to go all in, or i was going to get hospitalized and tubed. no one ever tells you that recovery is hard. they always make it look easy. the media is bullshit, is the first thing i learned. ed recovery ""influencers"" tend to be liars, probably also restrict, and i advise all new recoverers to avoid social media entirely during their recovery. i relapsed a few times, but never long term and while i still have bad days, i'm doing better. i think about the life i missed out on. i didn't get to spend my last thanksgiving with my parents or my older brother before he moved because i was hyperfocused on the food. i stopped drawing for so long because of my shitty ed, that nearly killed me, and made me hate myself for years on end. three years ago, if you would've told me that i would be able to eat pie, make smoothies whenever i felt like it, and eat peanut butter out of the jar yes, i now love peanut butter. i've changed my mind. it's good shit. i'd cry or think you're full of it. i feel so proud of myself. my anorexia likes to chime in and tell me that i was better off with it, that i'm awful, etc. but i know that it was never worth dying. to cry over going out. life is too fucking short to measure your coffee creamer, or to not eat bread when out with your dad on his 68th birthday, to not have that pizza with your friends. you will be happier. i promise. i have never felt so free and happy about life.",
"this sub made me realise i was in quasi recovery for years. i was on a cycle of heavily restricting and working out, deciding to stop, and going back to eating what i thought was a normal amount i only realise now that i was still eating way too little. i was still smoking and chewing gum constantly as an appetite suppressant. i had no energy, very irregular periods, brain fog, lots of other symptoms but never connected the dots. i thought i couldn t possibly still have an eating disorder, because i eat cookies sometimes when i started lifting earlier this year i figured i had to eat more to keep up with the extra calories i was burning, ended up just giving in and eating whatever i wanted. i felt so guilty at first but it was so freeing. not living under constant fear and guilt takes so much weight off your shoulders lol . i weighed myself for the first time in months today, and i m finally no longer considered underweight for my age height. it s scary but i know i m on the right path. feeling proud of myself today lt;3",

"asked a stupid question now i m confused. in my defence it was a moment of weakness and i totally shouldn t have asked, but last night i asked my sister if she thought i looked bigger, not since i started recovery, but from maybe a few weeks. i asked her to be honest with me because i knew she d lie and say no . well she told me i was looking healthier, which naturally translated to bigger, because i d clearly gained visible weight. this was mega hard to hear considering i ve been a healthy weight for about 4 or so months now. part of me wanted her to lie and say no but part of me needed to know what i look like body dysmorphia yo my ed has kicked back up the volume now and i have no idea what to do. send help??",

"quitting vaping, for recovery. just like the title says. i'm quitting vaping. on wednesday the 3rd, i met my nutritionist for the first time. i had my session and during it, she told me the reason i could not be weight restoring, is that i'm vaping so much. to be honest, i'm really bummed out i have to stop. i stared vaping since november 2 21, but i've used it to cope with all my anxiety. and now i feel like i have nothing to rely on. ofc, i don't have to and i could choose to continue, but some part of me knows it's better for the long run. i can't cope with the eating disorder, and now vaping, this might sound so dumb, but i feel so alone and helpless for sure. i have to face everything. i'm seriously on this battlefield fighting an ed and nicotine",

"feeling like i m unable to fully commit to recovery. at least right now i m going through a second round of extreme hunger, and during the first round when i was underweight i was excited to eat anything, like legit u could ve put burnt unseasoned tofu in front of me and i would ve been like . but this time it s very different, i have no appetite really, and i m back at work so i don t have time to just like... eat all day. like if i quickly make a lunch and shove it in my face 5 mins before i have to leave and then i m still hungry then i m kinda just out of luck?? i carry mixed seeds and dried fruit with me but it gets to a point where it s not appetizing at all. i m also unable to eat during non break times at work so honouring all my hunger is just not possible for me. plus with inflation, i only work like 2 hours a week and my mom is retired so we really don t have a lot of money to be restocking groceries every week, we usually only go like 2 3 times a week. not really sure what to do because i get xtreme anxiety when i end up going hungry for a bit but it s not realistic for me to be constantly eating",

"desserts similar in texture taste to protein bars?. i know i'm probably in the minority here my tastebuds have always been a bit interesting , even pre ed , but i genuinely like the taste and texture of protein bars. even after a full day of completely honouring my hunger for any type of food group, i don't feel truly happy and satisfied until i've had a protein bar or two...or three . but this habit isn't too kind to my wallet, or to my gut especially because my favorites happen to be the super dense, chewy types with a ton of added fiber , and i'd also like to break away from it because protein bars have long been a safe food of mine. however, nothing else feels quite as satisfying brownies and cheesecake come close but aren't quite chewy enough; mochi isn't quite dense enough; and so on. does anyone have any suggestions for alternate snacks desserts to try, or am i just questing ha for a non existent unicorn? do i just need to retrain my tastebuds to prefer ""normal"" desserts more?",

"first time in 3 years without counting calories. this is the first time in what feels like forever when my brain didnt add up all the calories ive consumed throughout it. i honored my extreme hunger fully, ate whatever i wanted with zero restrictions, and challenged a lot of food rules and fear foods. had unmeasured chips, cereal, granola, lots of chocolate cake and much more. and despite the guilt i was able to not think of food for the majority of the day. i played minecraft with my sister for a good few hours, laughing and enjoying myself to the fullest; had a video call with my girlfriend for the first time in forever, and had just actually felt happy and energized throughout the day. yes, i was eating a lot and snacking a lot but my mind wasnt preoccupied by food for 95 of the time, and it felt so freeing. recovery wins : ",

"fighting your ed is fighting your need to have control over everything. a lot of people, me included, use ed behaviors as a means of taking control of certain aspect of our lives. we enjoy and find comfort in the feeling of ""control"". if you choose to let go of that control in order to recover from an ed, would that not also result in ""fighting"" the urge to have control in life in general? what i'm trying to say is, if your ed stems from needing control, wouldn't that mean fighting it is actually you fighting two of your fears; both the ed and control or lack thereof in life? i know i worded this badly, but i feel like if i can overcome an ed, i can also overcome the anxiety and loss of control i had before my ed. two birds with one stone, in a sense.",

"the paradox of lanugo. just a post to get out a thought i ve never been able to share with anyone, but that screws with me regularly. since my most recent relapse that came to a head about a year ago still trying to climb out of that , i realized i have such paradoxical feelings about lanugo. first, ever since i was a teenager, nearly 2 decades ago when all this started, i saw it as a badge of honor, because it was a physical sign that i was succeeding in my eating disorder. i also didn t really have any interest in having a relationship at that point in time, so i wasn t worried about how, quite frankly, disgusting it can be to other people. to me, it was just a disordered badge of honor. now, nearly 2 decades later, going through this as someone who has been married for over a decade, i look in the mirror and i see lanugo all over both sides of my face, neck, and throat area, and i am first and foremost disgusted. i can t believe that my husband has to see me looking like this every day, and has for a year now. i can t imagine having to pretend that you re attracted to someone who literally has an extra coat of hair growing on their face, not to mention elsewhere on my body. i focus mainly on my face because that s where i always see it when i look in the mirror, because i m usually covering up the rest of my body. on the flipside, i m really struggling with weight restoration and handling a changing body, or even accepting that weight gain is actually necessary. i know all the logical reasons it is necessary, and i m not asking anyone here to convince me, because if i were able to be logical, i could tell you the same things that you would be able to tell me about exactly what it is, in fact, needed. unfortunately, my brain doesn t currently care, and my hatred of the lanugo on my face still isn t enough for me to throw myself into embracing weight gain, which is the only way it will ever actually go away. there s still a small sense of disordered accomplishment when i see it now, like there was nearly 2 decades ago, but by and large, the overwhelming feeling is shame, embarrassment, and disgust that even this is not enough to give me a kick in the ass hard enough to throw my all into this, because the fear is so fucking terrifying. sorry for the rant, i just needed to get it out.",

"the amount of i m no longer attracted to my spouse partner because of her his weight gain posts is triggering and infuriating af. tw: talk of fatphobia and should mention i am not yet in recovery. this is a vent. i see copious posts like this in the marriage and relationshipadvice subreddits. the op always mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks how to point out that their spouse has gained weight. they always make sure to include that their wife sometimes husband looked amazing and fit like a supermodel and was really into going to the gym eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. but how should you point it out? literally fucking don t. i m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn t already have one. my abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight i was always at a very healthy bmi and compared my body to the bodies of other women. but he would constantly tell me how perfect i would be if i just lost ten pounds, putting me in the closer to uw category. looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. he is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that i can t shake a decade later. and the comments in these posts are loaded with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together getting a gym membership. maybe it s a mental health issue binge eating. and there are always even worse comments like, you re still young and haven t been married long. you should get out while you can. your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their helth . fuck that. people would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over fucking weight gain. like, are you serious? i have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women naturally look like supermodels. it is a full fucking time job to look anything remotely close to that. it is an illness. it is exhausting. and bodies are supposed to change. but how can i ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? i am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. in fact, he always finds me most attractive when i feel like i look like a hot mess sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc. . he has never expected me to look a certain way pressured me to be thin. but it s terrifying. i am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which i do still struggle with. and these posts get me so heated.",

"did your nails grew stronger during after recovery?. i used to bite my nails hard since early childhood and for the first time i got rid of that ugly habit and managed to grow them out pretty long that being said, they easily break in the fucking middle and it makes me so frustrated since it often forces me to cut one of them really short and start it back. did recovery greatly improved the health of your nails?",
"hospitalised. if i have to say this to anyone try self recovery hospital is awful the lack of choice of when and what you eat, the constant needles and bloods and being watched. please don t be like me and let it get this far. it s super hard in general and super horrifying and traumatising being in hospital. it fill you with a lot of regret about what you ve done to yourself even then i m struggling with the control aspect of it",
"when should i tell the guy i m dating about my ed?. i ve started dating a guy and things are going good, but i really don t know how and when to tell him about my eating disorder. today he cooked dinner for me and also surprised me with desert and it really made me panic. i ate it but probably looked uncomfortable, and he must have though that i didn t like it. we re still pretty early in this relationship and i don t want to ruin things by burdening him with this so soon. but i also kinda feel like i can t handle going on more dates involving food with him. what should i do? how should i approach this?",
"feeling terrible. so my friend came over today and shes staying over. we went out and walked a lot yet i still feel so bad for eating. today i had a bowl of cereal, a slice of pizza, her and i split ice cream, a marshmallow stick with sprinkles and m amp;ms on it, rice w cheese and broccoli, and some fried cheese thingy. i feel so so so terrible about eating this much. i was so good about not eating yesterday and yet today im like this. what makes it worse is that i was so hungry even after the pizza and ice cream. i miss when i wasnt hungry like this, but some days im not, its only when i actually eat. when i restrict im not hungry like this. i hate hate hate this so much.",
hunger trigger after meal. i ve been in recovery for a couple of months. i ve experienced extreme hunger and honour it most of the time. i ve noticed that extreme hunger hits hard after i ve had a meal. any reason for this ? my ed brain is telling me i m just addicted to food,
"not sure if this is considered recovery. i have been eating more and having more cravings than i did last year. whenever my body would give me physical signs of needing to be fed bc i didn t know it , i saw it as inconvenience. now im on top of knowing what times to eat and what foods to eat. im even eating the foods i had on a bad food list like croissants and muffins for example.",
"spontaneous trip. so i went on a spontaneous road trip with my parents and got to see a lot of beautiful norwegian landscape. the trip also contained a lot of extra food; despite me for the umpteenth time ""planning"" to restrict my intake after weeks of being gluttonous. well i ate my normal breakfast and lunch, but we visited a store. so i bought and drank ,5 liters of chocolate milk and a very large cinnamon bun with tons of frosting. then i thought i would order a smaller dinner on the trip, and lo and behold i ate an entire pizza that would feed 2 3 people, just because it tasted good. i'll still order a pizza tomorrow despite eating it today because it's friday tradition. man going back to restriction is nigh impossible when i could instead eat large quantities of delicious food. i might take a run tonight, but i will make sure to eat a proper meal afterwards despite already eating more than double my planned intake. edit: well i just had a large ice cream cone i don't even know what's going on anymore",
"oh my god it really is possible. hi all, woke up this morning and realised i hit 1 year in recovery recovery has been weird, it s like learning how to live life normally again. after 1 years of being trapped in the eating disorder cycle, coming out of it feels like being reborn. been discovering some new interests learnt that when my brain isn t fried and malnourished, i actually really love doing word puzzles and sudoku. started reading books, doing pottery, and folding origami too nowadays my drawings are happy and colourful again. started going out with friends and saying yes to things, even when there s food involved. started trying new restaurants and dishes with ingredients i don t even know the nutritional values for. butter isn't scary anymore and neither is oil. nowadays i start to feel excited eating food again, which is something i would've never imagined saying. and my god the energy i have no more daily naps, no more fainting...i even feel like a nicer person. maybe it was just from being hangry. for the longest time i've only had my ed onto cling to for comfort. i was totally convinced i'd live and die anorexic, the disorder just swallowed me whole. nothing really changed until i accepted the fact that i deserved better than that. everything feels desolate and miserable when you live that way. even on your 'good days' you never really feel satisfied. it s so unfulfilling and boring. i don't deserve to starve or be in pain nobody does. i m not going to sugarcoat how recovery is. when you ve had extensive damage to your body, it will be gross. when you start to eat properly again, expect digestive problems. it is all temporary and necessary. if your organs must relearn how to digest food, it is not going to be a seamless process. but near the end of it, when you just stick to it, you will be able to curl up in bed at the end of the day satisfied. not hungry, dizzy, headachey, cold, or feeling your heart palpitate. to feel content and sleep well... recovering from an has been a lot physically and mentally, but the level of peace you feel is insane. no more obsession, no more brain fog, you can afford to worry about work and school and relationships and petty issues again. when you redevelop your life and personality outside your ed, you will feel fulfilled. you can and you will find passion and satisfaction in something other than losing weight. full recovery has been done by many and it will be done again. from someone who s been in the gutter for a decade, this is your gentle reminder to keep going recovering is a really difficult experience, so remember to stay kind to yourself in the process. wishing you all peace and love ",
"turns out, i've been eating cereal wrong lol. i'm home alone right now. when i woke up, i made my usual bowl of cereal. i don't weigh it out anymore, i just do a free pour. but it never fills me up for too long. well, when i'm home alone, i have the tendency to look through the cupboards or cook something for myself, since i don't want to disturb anyone by being in the kitchen. and i love cooking. out of curiosity, i decided to replicate the bowl of cereal i had this morning and weigh it out. turns out, i usually eat half the recommended serving size. and i've gotten so used to it, that it's enough for me, at least in the moment. but now i want to change that. the recommended serving size for cereal is already very small, but half of that? no wonder it doesn't fill me up. so i decided, you know what, i'm gonna make myself another bowl of cereal. i emptied my favorite coffee granola without weighing it. it definitely was less than the recommended serving size. but since i already had half a serving an hour ago, it adds up to a normal portion. now that i know what an actual serving looks like, i'm gonna try to increase my portion. first step : next step would be to increase my lunch from one bread roll to two. depending on how many my mom brings from work, i might be able to challenge it today. but maybe i shouldn't get ahead of myself. one challenge a day is already great progress. also, i'm a bit curious. what's your guy's go to breakfast? i used to fear cereal, but it's become my favorite way to start the day, especially since i'm a huge sweet tooth. in winter, i'd swap it out for porridge instead. i used to eat skyr and fruit for breakfast, and while i do still like it, it reminds me of my worst times.. i'm glad to have the freedom to eat cereal now : one day, i want to do one of those ""eating like my childhood self"" challenges, but that would include a lot of nutella. and i'm not sure if i'm ready for it. i haven't challenged nutella yet. but we have a glass that expires in november and it's barely been touched. i hope i can have some before it expires.",
"support. today idk why decided to look myself in the mirror since i started recovery. and i dont know how to feel. my abdomen no longer shows, i'm still skinny but i can't see where my abs should be. this, of course, was caused by being uw and not because i actually did strength training . i know i should feel good about it, it means that i'm doing things good, right? but it also felt scary, my ed feared. and now that i think about, making my ed scared makes me feel good, it's like i'm gaining control over it instead of it being the other way around. still, it has presence over my brain to this day and tried to make me feel scared about gaining weight again. i tried to fight this fear by thinking what i would get in return to recover. i could start working out again, this time with and actually good approach and healthy mindset. not an ed fueled way. i could join a dance club, i've been wanting to try dance out for some time and know that, right now, i can't because of my physical state i could be myself again i could be happy, free, and relaxed, once more. i would appreciate if you guys could give me even more reasons to why recover is worth it.",
"i think i'm ready to recover. tw for calories mentioned lunch time hit and something broke in me. i had the biggest binge i've ever had. i can't even remember everything i ate but i know that i don't want to touch anything cookies n' cream flavored for a long time. mid binge, something else also broke in me. while i was binging, i fessed up. i texted my mom and told her everything which has been happening to me. i'm terrified for what's going to happen, but i can't do this anymore. i don't know what to expect for my future but i hope it's good. do you guys have any idea on what i should do??? i've been eating very little this past week gt; averaging 55 6 calories per day lt; and that binge easily was probably gt; 2k calories lt; or around there. its only 1 pm and i seriously feel awful. i don't know if i should eat anything else today because i don't know if thats going to risk anything health wise, and idk if i can even bring myself to eat anything else because i just feel like death.",
"getting criticism from family for extreme hunger. i posted here the other day about feeling unsure about recovery and being scared of extreme hunger. i've been in a binge restrict cycle for most of the last month, and decided to just give in to the extreme hunger for the last week or so. yesterday i decided i had to commit to recovery. last night i overheard my step dad talking to my mom about me. he said, ""she eats too fucking much"" and said that someone needs to step in and tell me to stop. i haven't been able to go grocery shopping lately, and because of the extreme hunger, i go through groceries very fast. i've finished off two bags of rice, a jar of peanut butter, cupcakes, oats, quinoa, chicken, everything. i'm trying to save money and inflation is killing me. my mom basically stopped raising me when i was 14, i pay rent to her to live at home until i can afford an apartment. she sometimes lets me have leftovers or food she doesn't want anymore. my mom herself has disordered eating, as well as my step dad. i've literally been eating their expired and spoiled food. he labels his food in the kitchen. he bought cheerios in january and never ate them. i waited a few months and make 1 bowl, and the box is still there untouched, to paint a picture. my step dad bought strawberry pastries about a month and a half ago and never ate them. i waited until two weeks after their expiration date and ate them to make sure he did not want them. as soon as i ate it, i woke up and heard him screaming about me being a ""human dumpster"" and eating all the food. my mom told me i just need to control myself and that i lack discipline. she said i'm eating because i'm bored and i need a hobby and to get out of the house. nobody in my family believes i have an eating disorder because i started off fat and got skinny. i don't understand how they could watch me starve for two years and act like it's insane for me to be hungry. i've been in tears on and off all day. i just started to accept the idea of recovery and they're already making me feel dirty and wrong for trying to satisfy the hunger and balance my hormones again. i did make myself eat dinner today. i decided to see my actual dad today and he said i looked sick, and asked me if i've been taking a multivitamin. he said my hair looked very thin. i grew up with thick poofy hair. its been shedding a lot more since my eating disorder started . he had me get dinner with him, and stopped at a gas station to get me cookies and a drink. he told me to eat whenever i'm hungry. ""you gotta eat even when you're sad, that's one thing you can't do, not eat."" he offered to get me cake but i declined because i actually for once enjoyed my dinner. i want to commit to recovering and getting healthy again but i already know i'm going to get serious flack for eating again and gaining weight. my mom grew up fat, yo yo dieting and starving herself. she always comments on my body. my step dad is just a misogynist and calls women fat and ugly all the time. honoring my hunger is getting unaffordable and i'm not allowed to eat with my family because it's ""not my food."" i know i have to keep going but i don't know what to do. keep spending loads of money on food? getting takeout in private? why does eating feel so dirty, like nobody should see or know, not literally and not on my body? i hate having a human form genuinely ",
my boyfriend triggered me so much. im in 8m relationship and he s such a great boy but since we got together he been losing so much weight by starving him self he has an eating disorder too the problem is that i was in recovery i was gaining alot of weight and heating myself so much for it and them randomly my boyfriend tell me that he only drink water through the day and it does makes me want to starve myself i did stop my recovery and i lost some but i didn t restrict that much until last week he told me he s weight and that he lost 15 kg in 3 month and he s about to be even skinnier than me i didn t eat for 5 days bc of that but i binged yesterday im tired i don t want to plam him for that but he should know better why he choose to tell me when he knows that i have ed,

"what made you go from quasi semi recovery to actually recovering?. i just feel so stuck. whenever i try to eat however much i want i panic because of the guilt and go back to eating maintenance, enough but not too much. and even when i m eating adequately i can t let go of other habits that provide a safety net but actually suffocate me, such as calorie counting i still count mentally despite deleting apps . i know that what i m doing right now is better than actively engaging in my ed but it still doesn t allow me to feel free and i m so sick of it. yet, full commitment to recovery seems impossible, i have no idea how to get there and actually not go back after a while. is there anything that helped you progress from this stage? if yes, what was it?",
"how do i stop listening to the thoughts in my head telling to me relapse?. i recovered a year ago. i was loving it and i wasnt thinking about my ed, but now i just miss it. i think a big part in my sudden desire to relapse is my best friend. shes not eating much lately and shes lost some weight. i miss using my ed as a coping mechanism, i miss the comments id get from friends and family telling me i was losing a lot and a lot more. the only thing thats making me stop is remembering how miserable my life was and how hard itd be to keep up with my ed considering the fact that i have a job now.",
"society. ever since i developed my eating disorder and especially when i started to recover, specifically in the process of unlearning diet culture s stereotypes and fatphobia i had started noticing how normalized certain things are nowadays, despite being disordered or morally wrong. first off, fatphobia: the way people in larger bodies are shamed and deemed as inferior to those who are thinner, the way the word fat and being fat is seen as something bad despite it being just a description word for the size of an individual s body , and insult even, the amount of fatphobic jokes, and the crippling fear of gaining weight that many express. that s not even half the list, but all of these things are incredibly common and all over the place. then we have diet culture: encouragement to under eat and straight up restrict yourself to amounts that wouldn t even be sustainable for children, demonization of carbohydrates, classification of food into categories such as healthy and unhealthy , promoting the idea that you need to justify and or compensate for food, etc. what i m trying to say is: first of all, the way all these things are ingrained into our minds through diet culture, fatphobic statements, and dumb myths is crazy. a lot of people if not develop full blown eating disorders form plenty of disordered habits. honestly, it s hella tough to recover and get rid of a disordered mindset while all of this surrounds us on a daily basis. but we ve got to keep pushing through and use every opportunity to become even stronger. we got this ",
"finally spoke to a nutritionist. i ve been in recovery for a while and am eating normal amounts again. my thoughts around food haven t become less obsessive, however, so i finally decided to talk to a nutritionist after debating it with my doctor. i am so ready to forget how many calories a slice of bread has or automatically calculate how much i ve eaten. i feel like i ll never reach the end stages if recovery if i don t take full control of this and i m hoping this will help me free up the space in my brain that was never meant to be consumed by food.",
"protein bar companies and recovery influencers. is anyone else noticing that an increasing amount of recovery influencers on insta are doing promotions for protein bars? it is not sitting right with me, i feel it's predatory of these protein bar companies who are, i think, inherently complicit in and a part of diet culture to be approaching influencers and i am disappointed in these influencers for taking part in these promotions. i don't want to see recovery influencers partaking in any aspect of diet culture. what next are they going to post about high protein meal replacement shakes? these low sugar high protein bars are diet cultures latest obsession. deep in my ed i basically lived off them. i'm actually flabbergasted to see these influencers posting about them. and i think the companies know exactly what they're doing and it's so fucked up. sorry, just needed to rant, surely i'm not the only one who's noticed this. i am just going to unfollow all recovery influencers who do this. but i almost want to call them out and be like what are you playing at?

"peoples obsession with health is beyond triggering. i recently made a post on ex vegans talking about reintroducing animal products as a way to honour my cravings and overall the support was amazing and so comforting. however some of the responses were quite triggering in terms of basically shaming and discouraging the type of food i d eaten in honouring my cravings. i know i have internalised ideas of what i should and shouldn t eat but i ve never put those expectations on others. it also seems crazy to me saying to a person who s admitted to having an ed to cut out restrict certain food groups. i ve tried healthy eating and balanced meals so many times in my life but it always leads down a restriction ed spiral. so right now i m not concentrating on health , i m concentrating on my relationship with food but it is so difficult with people projecting their ed thoughts and behaviours on me. but i guess getting used to that is a part of recovery ",

"eating out of control since catching covid 19. i recently got back from a two week long work trip to spain. i'll admit that i was very worried about my eating habits and my weight while i was there: as you can imagine, my schedule was different and the foods that i typically eat were not always available. however, i went through the entire trip with my body remaining exactly the same which i confirmed via measurements and the scale . this lack of change made me feel relieved as it pointed towards consistency, which is naturally comforting as opposed to any sort of rapid change in appearance. however, i noticed that the day leading up to my flight and on the flight itself i did not feel very well. on top of being exhausted which i attributed to the current heat wave in spain alongside jetlag , it seemed like i was beginning to develop the beginning symptoms of a cold. besides that, i found myself ravenously hungry. as scary as it was, i just kept eating every time that hunger cropped up which was about every hour or so even if it was foods that did not feel ""safe"" to me. i tried to justify this hunger by the changing time zones and my moving around the airports, but i still felt guilty, comparing what i ate on the flight to that of the people next to me. i got tested upon arriving in the us about two days ago and it turns out that i have covid 19, which i have never had before. thankfully, my viral symptoms are fairly mild: i just have a very slight cough and some head congestion. however, my appetite has been absolutely horrifying. i always heard stories about people with covid 19 losing their appetites, but it seems like all my body wants to do is eat from the crack of dawn to the very end of the evening and not just eat, but eat the most caloric things that we have in the house. yesterday i ate nearly an entire pint of ben and jerry's ice cream in addition to foods like peanut butter, fried eggplant, and other snacks of that nature. today i was hoping i would be able to get back on track and get some control over things, but i found myself making some edible cookie dough for myself as i've been craving it for a while in addition to things like scrambled egg on toast and some cheesecake. i'm still eating things like fruit, but that obviously doesn't counteract all of the other food. i am trying to set meal times for myself, but i just keep feeling hungry outside of them, too. my period also started yesterday and my body image is in shambles. i don't know how to describe it, but it looks and feels as if my entire body has been blown up with an air pump. my lower stomach in particular is protruding an absurd amount. i took my measurements and they are more or less the same, but gt; the scale read a whole two pounds heavier in only a day one day of being home. lt; i am unfortunately expecting the same result for tomorrow. i just feel so guilty and stressed over this because i don't want to be eating this much food. i do not know why i am feeling this hungry when i am barely being active at all. i am still trying to take one solitary walk a day and then do my regular workouts to get some movement in, but i'm of course not going about town like i would if i weren't quarantining. if i try not to eat, the hunger just gets worse and worse and i just wind up eating even more. i don't know if it counts as binging; i don't think so because i am feeling hunger and stop once that hunger goes away, but it just keeps coming back more often than it usually does throughout the day. i just want it to stop and to get back to my regular eating habits that feel way less excessive. gt; i'm really scared about how much weight i'll keep putting on during this time. lt; i feel so abnormal, out of control, and just downright gross.",
"obsessing over weight. how do i stop thinking about my weight all of the time? i m sick of it. i ve never properly recovered, and the obsession is getting worse. i guess for some context, i had a friend die a year ago and it really brought my issues back to life. i m a runner and have been for about 12 years, because i love running but it also makes me obsessed with my weight, especially since i was heavier than i was before and now i m running slower. i m also a personal trainer because i love fitness, but it s like my passion intertwined with my eating disorder a lot and i don t really know what to do about it. how do i separate what i love with an eating disorder?",

i did it . im so freaking proud of myself right now. i hate going out to eat with people for the most part unless they re family but i went out with a friend to a mexican place and had two fajitas and chips and queso. it s little but i m so happy i could do it. i considered last minute canceling and i m so so glad i didn t.,
"reasons to recover right now . this post is mainly intended for u zealousideal top377, but i decided to make it into a post so others can see it, and cause it was so long haha. you will definitely die if you dont gain weight i apologize if this post is triggering, but i have to say this. you have to recover now or you ll die when i decided fuck it and started recovering, i basically had no other choice than death things i have suffered due to anorexia: 1 my tailbone came out of my back literally. this was basically what mainly pushed me to recovery. i was going downstairs at a hospital, was so tired i missed a step and fell onto my butt down each stair. idk why i passed out after and my mom had to carry me into the car. at home, my mom noticed a huge blood stain on the back of my shorts i thought i got my period, how funny and found out that my tailbone literally punctured through my skin. had that fixed but now i have a permanent scar in my asscrack 2 my grandma would carry me into cars up stairs sidewalks i literally reached a point where i could not walk for more than 5 mins without blacking out and my 7 year old grandma would help me do basic human functions like opening closing my car door and helping me take a step up a sidewalk. 3 severe brain fog memory loss like i genuinely do not remember a single specific memory at the time i was malnourished, just general periods of time this improves drastically with recovery, a new world opens up i also could not keep up a conversation for more than a couple mins as i would get so exhausted. 4 i had no bladder control i literally don t know why but i ve pissed myself so many times while on the way to the bathroom, cause when my bladder was full it would literally empty itself on its own. embarrassing 5 bruises from sitting sleeping i reached a point where even laying down on a mattress would cause my ribs bones to bruise and turn blue ouch 6 digestion problems everyone says this but you either shit pure water for days i would still refuse to eat starch to help or not shit for a month, no in between. 7 extremely low heart rate my heart rate was in the low 3 s even when i would walk and my parents would check up on me while sleeping since they were scared i would die in my sleep . . there are much much more terrible things and ed can cause. i will definitely try to add more if i remember other stuff. also feel free to comment more shit your ed has caused ",

"feeling guilty about buying lunch, i think i need help. sorry for the bad english. for some context, i've enby, 18 been struggling with my relationship with food since being a young child, and recently my therapist has brought up to the conversation that i show some signs of ed. i also have been dealing with mdd and anxiety since childhood. i feel like i'm kind of on edge. i always check calories and ingredients in food. i always think how i'm gonna organize eating based on 'will i go out?', 'what will be available to eat where i'm going?', 'how much i have eaten and what have i eaten?'. if i can avoid eating, i do it. i think to myself 'do i really need to eat right now or can i postpone it a little more?'. i lie about what i have or haven't eaten because 1 some times i skip foods 2 i'm embarrased of saying out loud that i have eaten and discussing food, or saying food names out loud. i have signed up for many sports at the same time, ending up tired and overworked, and although i loved those sports, my main reason was to change my body. some times, i get anxious and uncomfortable with the way i look and how clothes fit me. i can't see myself in pictures. i see old pictures and realized how distorted my perception of how i actually looked was, and i can't trust myself on knowing how i actually look right now. i feel overweight, disgusting, heavy and unatractve. i have avoided going places because i didn't like my body and how i looked. i have missed family reunions, parties, events. i recieve a lot of comments on my body from my family. combined to all this, one of my parents is a very frugal person and always taught that i should avoid spending money unless it's absolutely necessary. so, back to the title of this post, today at work i didn't bring anything to eat so by lunch time i went out to buy something to eat. i said to myself ""today i won't restrict, just eat a normal lunch like everybody else"". so i bought lunch and had half of it i feel full and now i feel guilty and embarrased and disgusting. i feel like i shouldn't have bought what i got, that i shouldn't have eaten and i feel like throwing up. i have never made myself throw up, but specially lately eating makes me nausceous and i feel like throwing up. i don't know what's the point of this. i guess i needed to write it down.",

being less active is hard.. i ve always been active in some way since i was little and i tend to get nervous and anxious when i don t move a lot. i know for a fact that i m not wanting to exercise to combat weight gain which i have excepted and i truly don t think i ll be able to fully stop. i guess it s fine if i continue to honor my eh but idk : ,
anxiety of gaining weight even if it is muscle. ive been a binge eater for about 14 years. i always denied my ed since i was always within my normal bmi. however it caused a continual 35 pound weight loss gain post high school. over the last 8 months i ve thrown out my scale and been focusing more on eating for health while not obsessing my food. i began working out in the last few weekss. this has allowed me to gain muscle and crave more food due to the calories i ve been burning. most of my clothes don t fit now and i m starting to obsess over food again. i cried today over this because i don t want it to take over my life again. now my only goals consist of severe food restriction. i feel like i can t afford new clothes even if i do thrift most of the time. i just want to be healthy and i need helping finding a new mindset.,
so close to a relapse. my life has gone to shit once again and i'm trying so hard to remain hopeful. to keep pushing in recovery when honestly i couldn't give any shits about it. i just need some extra support from people that actually understand how recovery works instead on my sense and misinformed friends.,
"things i like about recovering into a larger body. feel free to remove this if it goes against any rules, but i thought i'd make a positive thread for once, that celebrates the improvements in quality of life that come hand in hand with weight gain. as part of my recovery, i've ended up ""obese"" by bmi. however society sucks, and being ""obese"" actually isn't the worst thing in the history of the world ever. a lot of the time society literally behaves like being dead is preferable to not fitting its extremely narrow beauty constraints. however realising that thats bullshit, i also realised that there are real positive upsides to being in a larger body which aren't ever discussed about because of shaming and fatphobia in society. cushioning for injuries. when i was at my lowest weight, i managed to fracture one of my ribs in my sleep by knocking my elbow into it... wtf. in a larger body, i'm not terrified of accidentally bumping into things, or opening a door or closing a cabinet with my side, and i know if i trip and fall on my face due to being clumsy af i'll only be humiliated instead of actually hurt like i could have been before. periods i never got consistent periods at a low healthy bmi and need to be near the overweight range for them to be regular. now i can predict when it'll hit almost to the hour every month... a digestive system that works. being much stronger i can lift all sorts of heavy things without breaking a sweat. i used to be the type of person who asked other people to open water bottles for me, now people ask me to open water bottles for them lol my hair is rich, glossy as thick. i have natural curls but they disappeared at my lw, now i have them again and the energy to take care of them bigger lap for my cat to lay on lol never getting sick anymore. someone could sneeze directly on me and my immune system won't break a sweat, when before i caught every cold, virus and fungal infection in a 3 mile radius. feel free to add your own ",

"learned something new today . ok so here i was, thinking after some level of disordered eating since i can remember, treatment for bulimia as a teen, which did not have the desired effect, because i actually spent most of the actually ill years being anorexic, total of 4 rounds of recovery, 2 times with significant weight gain... thinking i knew just about everything about this illness and getting better... but no. today, i learned there is a thing called extreme hunger. which i have never experienced and likely never will because round 5 is about stabilising at a functional level, like round 4 was... 'recovery' for me is about taking responsibility for my problems and learning to find and maintain a healthy enough balance . bodies are fascinating, to create that in order to get healthy it's actually amazing. keep up the good work people not just the hungry people, but everyone who made a decision today which furthered their health. my decision was: talking openly to a friend ",

"listening to my body feels like a mistake can our bodies just be wrong?. i developed anorexia at the start of 2 2 and lost around half of my body weight. it was the first time in my life i was ever skinny, bordering on underweight. then i started having binge episodes in response to my low weight. i had some health problems at the time from restricting so i understand why it happened. it turned into a serious binge eating problem. i'm talking binges 5 days a week, upwards of 7, calories every binge. i felt feverish, tired, bloated all the time. i gained around gt; 3 lbs lt; in 5 months. i was horrified and started restricting again. i've been in the binge restrict cycle since march of this year and i can't take it anymore. i lost most of the weight i gained back but something in me broke and i just couldn't stand it anymore. i decided a month ago that i just want to eat normally again and not count calories. i've binged almost every day of this month since telling myself i need to stop counting and measuring. i still can't stop thinking about food and it's killing me to not fast in response. it's actually getting harder to restrict the more i binge eat. i know logically that i need to eat. i lost my period, clumps of my hair are falling out, i'm still tired. i'm a healthy weight for my height and i hate that my body is responding this way. like you gained, why can't the symptoms just stop? i know its only been a month but i can't see myself doing this for say, 5 or 6 more. i'd surpass my starting weight. i'm gt; 15 lbs lt; off from being overweight again. whenever i google anything about this, or my worries about developing bed or something, everyone says ""it might seem like a binge to you, but you have an eating disorder so it's really not a binge."" i hate it is eating 6, calories in 5 hours not a binge? is dissociating and eating until i'm physically ill not a binge? or they say to let the binges go and my body will restore its hunger cues, accept the binges, or eat trigger foods as much as possible until i don't want them anymore. how can i restore hunger cues and eat all of the calorically dense foods i like? even before my ed, i was the type of girl to always get seconds, always clear her plate, and always have room for dessert. i wasn't food driven but i always wanted the tastiest thing when it was time to eat, and for me it's calorie heavy food. always has been. i was never thin or even average before my eating disorder. i feel like it's easy to say that to someone if they've never faced the social consequence's of being a fat person, especially a fat woman. i don't know how to find advice or even a place for women who have been fat who developed eating disorders and got thin. it's so frustrating to see people who have never been fat to tell me not to worry about gaining weight, or seeing them stay thin after recovery and telling me everyone will be okay if i go all in and ""let my body restore itself."" i'm just tired of this. i'm trying to talk myself out of not binge eating today. i have friends who go to the gym and being around them anymore is so hard, and it has nothing to do with them, but the fact that they've found balance with food, are fit, are healthy, are happy. and i've never had that. i don't know if i can do recovery. i don't think i can maintain a healthy weight without my eating disorder, which means binging and starving, or getting back into my honeymoon phase and restriction indefinitely. no weight will be good to me. exercise is ruined. food is ruined. i hate having human needs. i'm so tired of counting, micromanaging my body, dealing with cravings, binge migraines, starving migraines. i don't even like being alive anymore. every day is a problem, thinking about what i did to myself with my dieting turned ed and bursting into tears during binges. i'm in so much distress and all anyone can say is, ""well, you have to eat. just find balance."" alright. whatever. i'm so tired.",

"my cousin has an eating disorder. how do i deal with it?. my cousin 17, f used to have a healthy body a few years ago. she would eat happily eat with us, without any worry. i don't exactly remember when, but around the beginning of the pandemic she started to lose weight. she would tell us about her new exercise regime and diet. we thought nothing of it at first, but we slowly noticed how she would exercise for 2 hrs every time, she would eat way less, and eventually start to vomit the little food she had. this went on for more than a year, until she admitted to us a couple of months ago that she knew what she was doing was wrong, and misses the times where she would eat without much restriction. she's been trying to recover ever since but she says that her body can't help but vomit out what it intakes. aside from that, our extended family has been reproaching her and making her feel guilty for her condition. now she's ashamed of her condition and doesn't want professional help because of how costly it would be for her family. she blames herself for the condition she has. i don't know how to help her, i don't know anything. the best i can do is to push her to professional help, but what can i do when she herself tries to reject that help, saying that she doesn't care if she dies early; if her body can't take the damage from her eating disorder, then it can't.",

do you have any advice on how to stop comparison in recovery?. hey guys i'm in early recovery from a restrictive eating disorder and something i really struggle with is comparison. for exemple if i want an ice cream but no one else does then i'll probably won't eat the ice cream because i don't want to eat more than others... however if everyone is eating ice cream i will also get one : but yeah do you have any advice on how to stop comparison and finally be able to fully concentrate on what i want to eat regardless of what other around me are eating or not eating ? thanks xx,

"differentiating extreme hunger vs binge. hi all, my history with food, body image, and exercise is complicated to say the least. without going into too much detail, over the past year year and a half i have been struggling with restricting binging, periods of over exercise, and i think i ve been experiencing extreme hunger all along and not feeding it. my struggles with this really started a year and a half ago when i was experiencing severe gi issues some of which i still have and was put on a super restricted diet. i later found out that i have a bunch of allergies intolerances as well allergic to 6 8 main allergens . so, my diet was inherently restricted due to my gi symptoms and allergies. along side of this i fasted and or had time restricted feeding windows in an attempt to help with my gi distress. on top of all of this i am extremely active. over 2 , steps a day at work, plus running cycling 5 6 days a week, and 2 3 days of strength training per week. everything compounded and led my body to be in a imbalanced state for a very long time. my restriction and then inevitable binges have gotten so out of control recently i realized that i really need help. one thing that was really messing me up was restricted feeding windows. i would only allow myself to eat at meal times. absolutely no snacking in between. even if i had finished a long hard workout i would still wait until meal time to eat most of the time. i have a therapist and we ve discussed the basics of my eating disorder, but i have still been struggling a lot in silence. i took it upon myself to meet with an ed centric dietician last week and she prescribed that i eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. the snacking was new to me as i only allowed myself to eat at meal times. snacking has been difficult because my body is so used to only getting food at certain times, it keeps telling me to eat more. now with the context set, i m struggling to differentiate a binge vs extreme hunger. i guess with binges they are either a result of restriction or some kind of emotional problem im trying to cope with food. my mental hunger is through the roof at all times. i was quite literally always thinking about food. is giving in to the mental hunger and eating a lot of food all at once a binge or extreme hunger? i struggle to stop eating whenever i start and that s why i started restricting so much. another thing i need to address is my activity levels. i m currently training for a triathlon so my daily needs are higher than most. i need some form of exercise in my life but i am considering pulling back on this for now until i get healthy. my question is should i listen to this mental hunger and eat 1 unrestricted in the hopes that my hunger fullness cues return? i really need to get a grip on this. if you made it this far, i appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read it. thank you",

"how do you handle intuitive eating going back to eating like you did pre ed?. i know the answer may seem a bit obvious, ""just eat when you're hungry, stop when you're full,"" but as i'm sure we all know that is much easier said than done. i struggled with an eating disorder for about two years; pretty under weight, dangerously low heart rate, near hospitalization. i went on a meal plan about seven months back and i've been back to healthy weight for about a month. the thing is: i'm still terrified of weight gain and struggle to not count calories. i'm at the point where my hunger cues are back and stable, but every day is still a mental war. intuitive eating is tough because i have reliable hunger cues but am still obsessing over foods, eating the same meals because i know their calories, and having minor freak outs when i ""go off track"" according to what i set up in my head. i guess my question is: how do you all handle intuitive eating while still experiencing difficult thoughts? i haven't had a true non calorie counting day in weeks because i'm so terrified of what my mind has villainized for years. do you all have any tips for intuitive eating and getting back to eating like you did pre eating disorder? thanks ",

"ambivalence of recovery. one year ago, i accepted the fact that i had a problem. i was miserable, cold and tired. one year ago i decided that i could no longer live like this, that i needed help. it took another few month until i got a therapist and really started this journey, but i never expected it to last that long. i thought that the things, about malnourishment and brain capacity, did not apply to me, because i was aware that i had a problem, because i could kinda do my uni work and talk to people. that it would be over in what 2 3 weeks and everything would be back to normal, after this 1 1 2 year. fast forward a few month into quasi recovery and the game of gaining a bit maintaining, and than gaining a bit more, took me just barely into a healthy weight again. being stuck in a binge restrict cycle. the last 2 weeks however my body was tired of fighting for so long and decided that it no longer wanted to play the game of the ed voice. so i ate and no matter how much the voice mentally begged to restrict, i was just incapable of doing it. now i am no longer malnourished and yeah it turns out again science is right. the malnourished brain is indeed not capable of realising a lot of things. it indeed is necessary to gain the weight. it feels like a curtain has been lifted from my brain, ever since i reached the medical not longer malnourished phase of fuelling my body adequately every day. i feel so much more like myself it s crazy. i can laugh and mean it. i get more emotional and i swear the world seems even a bit more colourful. i am no longer in this weird floaty state which is hard to describe and i did not even knew i was in. but also i had another realisation. another thing that i thought i already knew, but suddenly really sunk in to me. eds just fill out a space in your brain that was previously preoccupied, by another problem and as soon as the ed starts to get smaller the space is open for the problems to re enter again . but it is also the moment that we could start to rewire. instead of letting the dark material fill the void, it could be filled with so much more bright thoughts and love. it does not have to end up the same. it could be the start of something new. but ultimately it s you that has to make that decision. to take on the driver seat. no one else can do it. it s hard. it s against everything that you know. but nothing changes if nothing changes. today i ate breakfast after having one of the worst mental hunger eating binges in the middle of the night, after a week of eating way way past calorie minimums and i am terrified and proud and every emotion that you can think of, but i try to clench my fists and look forward. at least for today. one step, one breath at a time.",
"relapsing after a year of progress, seeking advice. hi all, i've never posted here but have often read threads for support and have always appreciated this recovery oriented space. i feel like i've really messed up. about a month ago, my dietitian and i decided that i no longer needed to be on a meal plan or log my meals after a tough year of gaining weight and pursuing recovery. a little background i am now twenty years old and have been in and out of ed treatment since i was twelve, never could really shake the damn thing for more than a few months at a time. when i came off my meal plan this time, i did ok for maybe a week, but then something snapped and i ended up downloading my fitness pal and starting to obsessively count my calories. i'm eating very low calories and am also very active as a college athlete which i know is a recipe for disaster but i'm afraid to be honest with my dietitian about it because i hate the thought of going back to a meal plan. i also have to admit i lost significant weight this month and part of me is afraid of having to gain it back as well... i thought about slowly increasing my calories but still tracking it but i know that's also a pretty shit idea. altogether, i feel very stuck and any words of wisdom would be welcome.",
"eh and anxiety on vacation. a couple weeks into extreme hunger, it doesn't seem like it will lower any time soon and that's fine. next week i'm going on vacation with my family. i live alone so there wasn't anyone to judge me so far for eating. i don't think my family will judge or comment. but so far i was always able to go any buy in a store right next to my flat whatever i'm craving. on vacation we don't have a supermarket nearby and i'm kind of worried what will happen when the mental hunger on something specific happens and i can't have it bc i would have to drive to the next store or bc they don't have it in the country . also kind of afraid that my siblings eat the stuff i want and bought for me. or that we go out for dinner and i don't feel satisfied after the meal. i know that i can and will take lots and lots snacks with me everywhere we go but i still feel so anxious about not getting enough food. really unnecessary because even when i eat everything i take with me there will probably be a possibility to buy more food. still i feel so much anxiety and panic thinking about this vacation. ed me would have worried about how they look in a bikini on the beach or panic about eating out because of uncontrollably calories. kind of funny that that isn't on my mind anymore at all.",

"how long for health issues to go away in recovery? and are these even related to anorexia?. i ve been in recovery for about 6 weeks. as i ve mentioned in other posts, my weight was never super low. i think i dipped under bmi 17 at times but generally hovered in the low 17s. prior to that i naturally maintained a i of about 2 . however, i maintained this low weight for about 7 years and as the years progressed i started to suffer from: heart rate all over the place. sometimes below 3 , sometimes above 18 . arthritis in my hands is this even a symptom of anorexia? genuine question rynauds having to pee constantly. super stinky pee sometimes gross but true . mini accidents constantly and one time fully peed on the street. i ve never been so afraid and mortified. this was my main reason to attempt recovery. sudden weird hearing problems. like being underwater at times dizziness and being freezing a lot so, i ve currently gained about 12 pounds or so over these 6 weeks with a bmi of 18.2 but no doubt will continue to creep up. already i m not cold, my raynauds has disappeared and the arthritis symptoms are gone. my hr is still wonky, but improving. i m still dizzy a lot. my hearing has been fine but it was a sporadic thing anyway. no longer have that peeing urgency at all. hormones are going crazy all the pms stuff like sore breasts, bloating etc. it seems like this is an awfully quick turnaround. could it be real? i will also add that i have lots of weird tingling in my arms and legs now and am getting muscle cramps constantly. i don t normally pay that much attention to how i feel, just kind of power on through the day, but i m trying to focus on things more to see the improvements and take true inventory on the damage i did. sorry for the long post. i m just looking for feedback as to whether these symptoms are normal, etc.",
"constipation problem tw calories mentioned . hi there. i developed a restrictive ed at the age of 19 i m a guy . i went to a very low weight got outpatient treatment, regained, but yo yo d up and down through exercise compulsion, dietary restriction and orthorexia ever since. i m 32 now. i only recently came across this forum and have decided to go for an all in approach the last month or so. it really seems like the only viable option for me at this stage, as any half measures usually tend to backfire on me and i inevitably go back to restriction, etc. i ve had extreme hunger fairly constantly and have put up some weight from my low baseline. i m trying to come to terms with this and the probable overshoot that will occur. i do respond to the eh but still hold back from going up to the next gear completely. i would probably eat all day long constantly if i truly gave in to it. my intake is probably in the region of 4 6 per day. what i m suffering with mostly, however, is my digestion. all my adult life, which is pretty much ever since i developed anorexia ed, i ve had very slow digestion, bloating, etc. i ve had to purposely fill my bladder to increase my intra abdominal pressure to create the urge to pass a bowel movement. the natural rhythm has all but gone. i ve had colonoscopies, etc and my gastro has concluded that my problem is purely functional. he just advised using a prokinetic motegrity and osmotic laxatives as necessary. this hasn t worked unfortunately. i ve used every kind of supplement you can think of. i still tinker with movicol miralax, magnesium oxide or citrate in varying high doses with a variable schedule but i feel they only add to my bloating with little help to actually pass any movement. stimulant laxatives like dulcolax work, but i ve never really abused them for any prolonged period, as i know that will make my situation worse. any dietary alterations don t really make much of a difference i ve tried high fiber, no fiber, carnivore, etc. the only common denominator is that my intake has always been restricted. i worry that this could be a chronic issue that may never resolve. what i ve noticed recently though, with a little bit of insight that has come since going all in, is that i ve been chronically stressed and anxious all day every day forever. it s like i ve been in fight or flight mode on a constant basis for years. it s such a complex situation but maybe my digestive issues could be related to this high level of anxiety also? i was on an ssri for years but stopped that some time back. it never made much of a difference to my stress, and now i ve come across some account of ssris actually causing longterm bowel dysfunction. i don t know what to believe at this stage, and don t know what my next step should be. i m hoping that with proper weight restoration, exposure to different foods in different situations, neural rewiring of all my compulsive exercise and movements, etc that things may improve. but in the meantime, any tips on how to manage the discomfort and ensure a daily bm would be very much appreciated. the extreme hunger and eating over 5 calories a day is a liberating experience but when you have very sluggish bowels it can make a bad situation worse .apologies for the rant ",
"i wish i could separate my body image issues from food. i ve never had great body image, and i ve always been especially insecure about my legs. but, i ve always still been relatively thin and never experienced fatphobia, so i ve never experienced any kind of oppression based on my body type. i never felt extremely confident about my body, but looking back on it, especially as i got a bit older but before my ed developed , my insecurities didn t interfere with my life very much. i never had body image days so bad i couldn t leave the house or socialize. but the thing i miss the most is that a bad body image day before my ed would never interfere with my eating. it never even crossed my mind to skip a meal if i felt especially bad about my body. now it crosses my mind nearly every time i look in the mirror on a bad day. i just wish i could go back to never thinking about the way food would affect my body just eating what i wanted, when i wanted, and never thinking twice about it, even if i didn t feel great about my body. man i wish i could go back to when my ed first developed and just slap myself. none of this is worth it. it s so hard to deal with these thoughts constantly, every single day.",
"complications long anorexia sufferers battlers gt;15 years of ed here??. hi all, i am 33 years now and suffering from anorexia for more than 17 years now... so long that i really can't imagine a life without but im so sick and tired of this way of living. i have a good social life, a part time job and i actually love food and drinks. the thing is anorexia gives me control and a kind of '''safe'' feeling. but i know my life could be so much more than this; friends are getting serious relationships buying houses together and having children i'm surrounded by people who truly loves me. i want to date again, to find a man as well etc etc.. i already suffered from an ileus testine obstruction failure when i was 25 and did die almost. i spent 5 weeks in the er because of medical complications such as kidney failure because of my bad body condition. luckily, i recovered from this complication. but now, 8 years later i still am having my ed and doing the same thing all over again. i never reached a healthy weight since my 16th and currently having a bmi of 14, which for me is very low but when i compare to others, my ed tells me its ok. family friends and medical support are very worries for me since they are telling me im very very thin and are suffering for so long, i really have to keep gaining and trying to recover. question: for those who also suffering for so long from anorexia: how is your physical condition and are you also feeling like your body is done with it. like, after all these years, its enough and your body feels like getting weaker . have you have complications from the ed ? just want to read a bit more about the downsides and getting inspired to fucking b eat this ",
"not hungry until i start eating .and then i can t stop . and by not stopping, i mean i could easily go through two family sized bags of chips, 6 huge bakery cookies, and an entire bag of carrots with like half a jar of peanut butter. it s kind of horrifying. i m not sure if this is extreme hunger? it s baffling. i ve been in recovery for about 6 weeks and from what i ve read about other people s experience with eh this doesn t feel as extreme? and it only happens like once a week, maybe? i m just going with it, but it s like this gaping hole opens up inside me and i m just in a frenzy. tw for weight . i should add i wasn t that underweight to begin with. 1 4ish at 5 6, and maintained that for 7 years. but i started to have health issues:freezing all the time, arthritis in my hands not sure if it was related to anorexia but feels like it , thin hair, skin really dry, and most embarrassingly and the reason i kind of snapped to and realized that i did actually have an ed was serious problems with my bladder, including an incident when i completely and fully wet my pants in public no one saw me, but i was out walking and just couldn t stop. i was mortified i m still not convinced i was light enough to truly be considered anorexic, but regardless, my low weight was causing these problems. anyway, i m not up to about 112 115 and still gaining . i realize this post is all over the place, but not sure how to manage these bouts of eating?",

"your body may not be the same and you have to accept that.. i m not recovered in the slightest but lately i have been doing a lot better and coming to terms with a lot of things. throughout my ed i never truly knew what to strive for. i am quite young but would find myself looking at my body from when i was 11 12 years old and desiring it so badly. i d also find myself idolising my body from a couple of years ago and wishing desperately to have it back. here s the thing, i m 16. i will never achieve that body because simply put i hadn t hit puberty. i will never look as skinny and frail as i did in a shirt ever again because simply put i have double d tits now. you re never going to look extremely skinny in a shirt because they re there. i m never going to look as frail as i did because i have hips now. with my hips i have fat around my midsection and i don t think i can have one without the other. i know it s hard to say but i can t keep wanting a body i had before puberty because i can t reverse puberty to get it back. i think this applies to many scenarios and with any set of age differences. if you are an adult you cannot get your teenage body back because you are not a teenager anymore. i find myself coming to terms with this more as i distance myself from my ed and it almost makes me feel better. it s not a fault of mine it s a biological change that i have no control over and shouldn t beat myself up over. the same applies for all of you.",

"parent's continued remarks about food eating are starting to hurt. hi all, tw: talk about restriction i just want to get some advice here. some backstory; my two older sisters have histories with eds that my parents are well aware of. i have silently struggled with a weird relationship with food body image since my teens but haven't been very vocal about it. we grew up in a very diet centric house, with my mom on ww constantly and not cooking us regular meals. we were often left to fend for ourselves or my parent's favorite word, ""graze."" in the past few years, i've noticed my parents both in their late 6 s making more and more concerning comments about food. they'll make remarks about how much someone is eating, or tease one of us for eating breakfast ""when we're having dinner tonight"" i'm not joking . its something me and my sisters all joke about but i think it is actually starting to get to all of us. so i recently came down with covid, as did my dad. i called him today to check in and see how he was doing. after filling me in, he said something really disheartening. he said ""well one good thing about it is i'm not eating."" i didn't say anything, just kind of went ""heh.."" and he said ""i think we all sometimes just eat when we don't really need to."" i was so annoyed. what is the purpose of this comment? and this is coming from him who eats like one meal a day. i'm just feeling really annoyed and upset, and also trying not to internalize it. any advice?",

"eating... life... struggles... tw calories, also a swear word . so... today is saturday, and i've eaten a good portion of breakfast granola, half a pizza for lunch, food at an indian restaurant for dinner with a lassi milkshake smoothie looking drink, which is scary because liquid calories , a large cup hot cocoa, and way too much chocolate candy i filled up a large mug cup thing, probably got 4 grams of chocolates in there; and i estimate i've eaten gt; 5 calories lt; today. i looked forward to everything i ate, and enjoyed it all. but that's all; my thoughts never went towards anything else. and despite feeling really stuffed, the classic mental hunger is still there: ""i could eat more, i kind of want more. tomorrow i want to eat three x, and i want two servings of y"". it's so frustrating, and sad, and scary. not to mention i've eaten so much this week, much more than everyone around me, or at least it feels like it. and tomorrow happens to be my birthday, and i'm going to a restaurant to eat a high calorie dinner for the third day in a row. i'm scared, and i know i want to eat so much and so many different things, and i expect i'll want a lot of cake for my birthday too. i think to myself ""i want to restrict again starting monday, new week new me"" but i know i already want to eat more than i ""should"", even though it's two days away. my fourth year in uni starts in a few weeks, and all i think about is food, meals, calories... what i want to eat, how much i want, exercise to ""justify"" the monstrous intake... and most devastating of all, looking at my stomach, which has indeed got actual fat on it these past couple of months which scares me because fatphobia and fear of things like diabetes and ""future restriction for health reasons"" of course . it's so damn exhausting, and i don't know what to do. now i want to go to bed and wake up for breakfast? endless, vicious cycle that i'm not brave enough to get out of; i am not tough enough to go ""all in"", not committed enough to stop compulsive exercise, not confident or motivated enough to find myself outside my ed. it's so easy to tell others to just ""eat more and get better"", but doing it for myself? i've never found anything as difficult as this in my entire life. and almost the worst thing of all, which is genuinly not good for me, is that i have eaten so much ice cream, hot cocoa, chocolate, cheese, cream etc. which contains so much saturated fat. this isn't bad for normal people, but with familial hypercholesterolemia i need to really limit my intake for my cholesterol's sake, but i just fucking can't...",

"how to deal with narcissistic mother purposely triggering my ed?. a light bit of backstory. my mother has been staying with me in my apartment because she has intense addiction issues and being alone makes her use even more. she sleeps in my living room and explains she is only here because she can t be alone, and i tried to tell her to go home because she is highly abusive i won t go into too many details but she guilt tripped me and said if she goes back on heroine and overdoses and dies it would be my fault because i abandoned her. today after a few days of restriction, i went into the kitchen and ate the thin end piece of a bread loaf. while i was eating it, my mother screamed at me wow you re eating again? seriously? , even though it was the first time i ate in days and she knows this . she basically said i was fat and shouldn t be eating, and then she gave me the most disgusted look at my body. she knows i have an ed. she knows i literally had an intake assessment with an ed psychiatrist for inpatient treatment this morning which went awful . she knows i have nearly died from my ed, and about all of my ed related emergency room visits. i asked her to stop commenting on what i eat when i eat how much i eat, and she screamed at me here you go with your attitude again . she literally had just called me fat, gave me a disgusted look, and said i ate too much. a thin piece of bread after days of restriction and i deserve to be punished. she knows i don t eat and that i am anorexic. i just don t know what to do. i took a lot of benzos and mixed them with a lot of opiates to calm the fuck down, but i did this twice today so i m not sure how much i ve taken at this point. she wants me to die. its not the first time shes blatantly told me or implied that she wanted me to die. one of my suicide attempts landed me in the hospital, and because i was a minor at the time she had to come. when she was there, she was high on heroine and looked at me with evil in her eyes and said you should have tried harder so you died . now, she s playing with my ed in the worst ways. i m trying so hard to recover with so many barriers in the way , though i had a plan to fast for over a week. now i m going to do it. i was going to purge the bread but she knows i purge and belittles me and calls me a disgusting idiot when i do. i just feel so much more disgusting than i already did. my body dysmorphia is horrendous, and she just solidified my perception of my body. how am i supposed to deal with this? i ve dealt with it my whole life, she has always put me down, but my heart is too big and i wouldn t be able to live with the consequences. i tried to kick her out and she said i was the reason shes going to die, so i took it back and don t know how to make her leave. i don t know how to heal, how to recover, or if i can. sorry for the wall of text, i just have nobody to talk to about this and i m pretty high off of the pills because i lost track of how many i took.",

"permission to eat once weight restored?. i recovered weight restored back at the beginning of the year and overshot a little, probably gt; 1 15 pounds lt;. my extreme hunger faded, and i was eating relatively normally for a few months after that 3 meals, 2 3 snacks . since then i ve relapsed, and while i m not nearly as sick as i was at the height of my ed, i know i m going to need to gain more weight. something that i struggled with after weight restoration that i think played a large part in my relapse was giving myself permission to eat once weight restored. in some ways i actually found it easier while i was going through extreme hunger i was so hungry all the time, and i knew i was underweight and needed to gain so eating was honestly pretty easy. but once the extreme hunger dissipated and my weight stabilized, i found it hard to justify eating certain things, especially higher calorie foods. i think ultimately this contributed to me relapsing because in a way i almost wanted to go through extreme hunger again so that i could like, savour recovery this time yes, typing this out im aware of how disordered and ridiculous this sounds haha . i know the simple answer is that i have permission to eat whatever i want even once im weight restored. but i really dont want to go through this again, so does anyone have any tips on how to deal with these thoughts once weight restored?",

"duration, length of recovery.... hi about a month and 3 days into recovery. all in and giving in to my hunger, etc. my first breakthrough cycle in ha has come and gone, my extreme hunger is still a little here but nowhere as bad as the first two weeks. i am seeing positive signs of the second cycle. i know in ha recovery you're supposed to wait for three consistent cycles after the initial 'out of sync' one before making any changes in diet, and i am only a month in total w ana recovery. i feel ok, i am eating when i get hungry and foods that i actually want. i don't weigh measure count calories anymore because i a can't be bothered w the maladaptive nature of it and b not doing this has given me so much more mental space to do other things. if i were to estimate, at this point i am hitting around 2 25 cals per day but i don't track at all so it can def vary. also do light exercise, no compulsive ones. i'm willing to continue eating because i am seeing the beauty in normalcy of life and rly feel disgusted and recognise that my past behaviours were extremely maladpative and unhealthy. however, i am aware of how long the body actually takes to recover i'm sure that even with my cycles 'looking good', my body isn't fully recovered. so my question is, at what point do you know when you are 'back to normal'? idrc abt weight either, i'm just going off of health. is it when all restriction symptoms finally wear off? like muscle tingling, hair starts to get thicker . should i continue what i'm doing for the next two months and just observe? thx ",

"feeling real squicky. i m currently restricting but getting closer to considering recovery, and as part of that am trying to be a little bit more honest about it. i talked about it with my trauma therapist and also a friend last week. both were supportive and accepting of the fact that i don t feel ready to change anything at the moment, and it felt really good to talk about it. in a flush of feeling good and like i m an adult taking charge of my own health, i reached out to my psych s office and asked to make an appt this week to discuss some things that have come up . i also had an annual today with a new pcp, and told myself that if i was feeling comfortable, i could share then too. and then a week passed and i ve just been sitting in a shame spiral, feeling so emotionally hungover and embarrassed by everything i said. i just had the appt with the pcp and it left me feeling really out of sorts. i declined to be weighed which seems to be way out of left field for everyone there, and the pcp asked several questions about history of ed, whether i m happy with my weight, and appetite. i am at a normal bmi, so she didn t seem overly concerned, but i lied through my teeth and i feel so ashamed and embarrassed about it. doctor appts make me feel so anxious, and i hate the idea of something being written in my records, so then you have to talk about it even if you re not comfortable. i m worried i shouldn t say anything to my psychiatrist tomorrow. i really hate having something that i feel like i need to lie about, it makes me feel about 15. i just hate this whole thing really it s exhausting and embarrassing and objectively pointless and i m really ashamed that i m an adult woman lying to her own medical professional. i would really prefer to just figure out how to recover on my own and never have to share it with anyone, unless i want to later when it s no longer an issue. but i m not sure i can do it without help, and it did feel good to be able to say some of the crazy shit that s been in my brain all day every day to people that i trust and who care about me. i m just not feeling great about myself right now and kind of want to hide under a rock and pretend i never told anyone about this. any advice or pep talk is appreciated.",

"staaaaaaahp spreading misinformation about extreme hunger.. no, it s not binging or bed. no, it s not happening because you eat sugar. no, it s not caused by your hormones. no, it s not a result of not eating balanced meals. the biological purpose of extreme hunger scientifically referred to as post starvation hyperphagia is to restore the body s optimal fat to fat free muscle mass ratio. you will continue to experience eh until your body has restored 1 fat free mass, which requires your body to achieve more than 1 fat mass fun fact: this is also why we overshoot . it has absolutely nothing to do will power, hormones, or swinging from one extreme to another , and everything to do with how your body functions and how it responds to a percieved famine both during and after. i m going to get real with y all: the reason the shit i mentioned above is circulating around in this sub, and most especially in other ed subs, is because y all are afraid of gaining too much weight and you need to address that internalized fatphobia. spoiler : there is no gaining too much in recovery; your body is smart as fuck and knows how to heal and regulate itself. whether you re all in or taking a slower approach, you can t recover without eating a lot of food, period. you can t starve your body for months years and then expect it to bounce back like nothing ever happened, like you won t gain weight, or only gain what you re comfortable with while eating what you think is enough. you have an eating disorder the entire problem is that you do not know how to feed yourself . and you certainly don t know how to cope with triggering situations if you did, you wouldn t immediately jump to restriction and fight tooth and nail to find any excuse to view eating according to hunger as immoral or wrong. so stop trying to find answers to excuse away your real hunger. the fact that you re trying to dismiss your hunger in itself is a disordered behavior. just food for thought pun entirely intended . thanks for coming to another episode of sareeee48 talks. edit: this is not an attack on anyone, especially those who are struggling to honor their hunger. that shit is hard. recovery is hard. but the level of misinformation that i ve seen being encouraged as of late is really not okay. remember that the advice you give may have real impacts on the people who read it. if you re determined to share your experiences or opinions, that is absolutely okay but at least make sure it s accurate and follows the sub s rules.",

"unable to restrict; good thing?. so from thursday to sunday i ate like minimum gt; 3 kcal lt; each day; probably even upwards of gt; 4,5 kcal lt; on saturday, simply because i ""wanted"" to. it hit me a bit hard mentally, and lately these past few weeks i've gotten visibly bigger i don't know if this is true or body dysmorphia, but probably partly true . so in my grand smart head i decided to do one day of restriction still aiming for gt; 2 kcal lt; and nothing below ; but i kind of... can't? i feel unable to restrict, when it was once so easy... now i can't get ice cream or my evening meal out of my head, and i also want a banana with my evening meal... so that would put me at closer to gt; 3 kcal lt; again despite me telling myself to go lower. it feels impossible to go back to restricting, and it's so scary... i know i should gain weight and ""listen"" to my body, but i don't trust my body at all. all i want to do is eat, think about food, etc. i don't even want to do anything else, i just want to wait till my next meal, so restricting is somehow so much harder than before. a part of me says this is a good thing, but the ed simultaneously tells me the opposite. has this happened to anyone else; where restriction somehow feels impossible?",
extreme hunger when to eat less?. how do i know when my body is ready to consume less calories? is it when i'm neither physically nor mentally hungry or should i still keep pushing at this phase? bc even though i'm not hungry i'm neither full after eating. so stop at a phase where my body tells me to actually stop because it's so full?,
"i m going to stop until it s too late. i did relapse and rn i m 1 going to feel like i failed at it because i ve managed to restrict for 4 days only, but i understand that continuing will only lead to more struggles later on. thank you to everyone in this community for supporting me, i rlly appreciate it ",

i think i'm having issues with healthy food but user to be wkth calories. i've always had obsessive addictive issues. my entire family are alcoholics and other issues. i used to focus more on the numbers and now i recovered some but focus on the ingredients more. i eat very limited food because i'm scared on the ingredients. i only shop at sprouts and an asian store now. it's not normal just avoiding gluten. i can't eat most foods and couldn't eat at any restaurant pretty much. i eat weird foods like organs including balls and soda with probiotics. i'd rather eat weird natural food than normal food. the knowledge that some chemicals added to food are definitely bad destroys me. i know small doses and it's not that bad. not food realted i've also replaced my soap and beauty products too. i don't know what to do.,

"do stretch marks mean i'm not weight restored?. i'm on month 7 of recovery now and i thought that i had weight restored a few months ago, but just recently i've gotten some new stretch marks, especially on my thighs. i'm perfectly fine with gaining more weight if that's what's necessary, i'm just confused since i thought i'd stabilised. do these stretch marks mean i'm gaining weight, the weight is redistributing or something else? thank you : ",
extreme hunger but don't know what to eat. hey i've had extreme hunger for about two weeks and usually i experience mental hunger on something specific like peanut butter straight out of the jar ofc but today i've had mental hunger on nothing specific. like i just want to eat but nothing sounds interesting as it used to in the past days. almost like boredom eating but a lot stronger. anyone else has that?,

"can we society, i mean get rid of the idea that losing weight is the only way to recover from trauma?. well, okay, first of all, has anyone else ever heard this, or do i just not understand how to integrate information into my brain correctly? bc both can be true. literally just saw a tiktok that was completely non ironically like if you heal your trauma, you ll automatically have an hourglass figure , which sounds wild at first glance but apparently not wild enough, bc i ve also heard people say that irl??? like, i ve even had a therapist say that to me irl???? first of all, body shape shouldnt fucking matter, amp; it s kinda dehumanizing to break down the entire vast and beautiful scope of what human bodies can look like into some people look like this inanimate object, amp; others look like a different one . second of all, as bad as all that shit already is, i d argue it s also really bad to assign moral value to body shapes. maybe i m biased bc i m an extreme pear, so i m not one of the good ones. but idk. all i m saying is, if it wasn t impossible for a man and shameful for a woman to look like me, i probably wouldn t have an ed. also, like if i ever heal from my trauma, i m still gonna look like this. i had repeated trauma of a specific type when i was 19; i was pear shaped before, amp; i continue to be pear shaped now. my life wasn t devoid of trauma before that, but that s kinda the big one amp; i still look like this. the goal of healing from trauma shouldn t be weight loss, the goal of healing from trauma should be literally healing from trauma. bc nobody deserves to be traumatized, amp; that feeling isn t good when it happens to you. i, as a human being, deserve to not have to put up with my trauma responses everyone deserves better than what happens to their mind amp; their body when they have ptsd or a similar disorder. why can t we focus on that, instead of how my body carries weight?",

"i'm not your girl to talk to about eating disorders and your food body image problems. everyone seems to think that because i have struggled with an ed for such a long time that means i'm the perfect person to come to discuss their food and body issues. i'm in recovery, why do you think that's a good idea? it's so triggering i hate using that word i've dealt with an ed for 1 years and i've probably spent the last 2 solidly in recovery. but my relationship with food and body image is still incredibly fucked. like people will talk to me about how they didn't eat or how they ate too much and i know it's part of the competitive, validation seeking ed mindset. but leave me out of it. it's so upsetting for me to listen to. sometimes they will even compare to what i eat which makes me feel really awful. at one point i had a roommate that did this constantly and luckily he moved out early. my friend just sent me a text ""tw eating disorder"" and then sent a long story about a camper at the summer camp he works at who is presumably struggling with an ed, but i only glanced at the texts because he started going into a level of detail that makes me very uncomfortable. i mean, if you have to say ""tw eating disorder,"" then that is something i don't want to engage with entirely. a tw is not just a heads up, it's a sign that this is something i shouldn't participate in.",

"taking tentative baby fawn steps towards the concept of recovery. i ve been doing some trauma work the last six months and hoooo boy has it reactivated old restrictive eating issues from when i was a teen 2 yrs ago at this point . it feels distinctly different this time around the first time was more akin to what i think of as the media portrayal hating my body, comparing myself to celebs looking at thinspo, skipping meals entirely, terrified of gaining weight, wanting to be skinni . this time around it s more .practical? but also bleak. i understand completely that this is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and that there s no ending other than recovering myself, recovering with assistance, or doing my body severe physical harm. i see self assessments where they ask about whether you re terrified of gaining small amount of lbs and i m really not. i don t feel great when i gain but i expect it to go up and down. i don t love my body, but i don t hate it either. i have no na vet or hope that this will end with me feeling happy with myself or having the ideal body type. mostly i m just controlled by the numbers and food centered ocd thoughts actions, but it is definitely impacting my quality of life and mental health. hoping to get some perspective on: 1. have you ever told a therapist psych about your issues while also explaining that you re not ready to change anything yet, and if so how did it go? 2. have you had periods of time where you feel possibly almost maybe ready to recover but don t want to start yet? what tipped the scales over into pursuing recovery? 3. do you see an ed therapist and if so what do you find helpful about it? do they act as a regular therapist too or is it a food specific add on? i already see a regular and trauma therapist and adding on a 3rd feels like a lifestyle 4. any books or media you d recommend that helped you understand the how s why s of it all, or helped you with harm reduction techniques? i really appreciate this community, and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read through this.",
to cover my mirror or not?. i m really struggling with body checking constantly. i ve tried lots of things my therapist and dietician have both suggested but i continue to struggle. my dietician wants me to try turning my mirror around this week or at least cover it from my neck down to avoid body checking. i do not want to do this. mostly because i really don t want my room to look kinda messy with my mirror covered i am a very organized person lol and turning it around would also be an eye sore for me. i m also not sure avoiding myself is the best thing to do. my therapist agrees but says that turning it around for at least a week might help create a healthy pause in my body checking. idk. what has helped you? has avoiding the mirror for a while been beneficial?,

"my face is constantly swollen and puffy?. it doesn t seem to go down at all. my cheeks are always puffy and under my chin as well. i know it s not all fat because it has gone down in the past, but it s making it hard to look at myself in the mirror. i think i look so incredibly ugly and i m the only person at work who still wears their mask. i have no idea what to do and it s really upsetting me? i drink lots of water, watch my salt intake, gua sha twice a day. is this due to recovery? i hate it so much i m so embarrassed : ",
what do i do. i have been in recovery for 7 months but recently i have been hit with another wave of extreme hunger. i honestly want to restrict again but i know that i have to push through this. anything that is worth fighting for is not easy. i am gaining weight fast though and am nearing an overweight bmi. does anyone have any words of encouragement because i m struggling heavy today ,
"more candy in recovery. ever since recovery i've needed more candy to feel ""satiated"". that's all well and good, but when i eat 4 grams of chocolates and a cup of cocoa before feeling satiated, the feeling of illness usually strikes first uncomfortable, but damn that was some good candy so i feel way too full, and somewhat nauseated in a way only too much chocolate and sugar could make you... but i don't want any more candy now at least but boy a glass of milk sounds delicious... have a good weekend, friends : ",
"well i did it lads and lasses. i didn't go on the scale and check my weight today. i always do it saturday mornings, but i think it's holding me back. who cares about a number on a scale, when i can eat what and how much i want, feel better, and worry less? this is a win win situation; let's just hope i can stop weighing myself entirely. on a side note, the last time i went on the scale it showed the highest number i can remember seeing, so the temptation to check my weight is really strong today ",

"another lament on the ed to gymfit trope. this has been in my brain these past weeks and i just need to get it out to look at it from the outside and to reaffirm how silly it is. so yes i am as influenced as the next person by these i used to have an ed and be skinny now i go to the gym and i m fit tropes. i know in a lot of cases these people are not recovered or have simply traded one obsession for the next. when i was in my og ed phase i used to work out so much and since then and now in this relapse i only work out once or twice a week only as i find it often makes me tired afterwards and hinters my productivity in other areas like work and college. my life is just different than it was back then plus add 4 years and the side effects of malnutrition. i want to accept this even if i constantly feel like i m being lazy and yearn for my old disordered gym obsession. while in a realistic world i want to be medium fit, i m just not a sporty person. so now when i m considering recovery again and slowly trying to build up the courage to take the leap, i keep thinking ok then i ll have more energy when i eat more and then i should work out more like those people on fucking instagram. but i also know i probably won t do that despite having the energy, my life is still busy and i won t have the time to. and it s hard to accept that i won t be a ed to gym fit success story. the weird thing is that of all my friends i am almost the only one who does formal excercise. one friend goes jogging on occasion, another rides her bike to work more often. but i keep thinking oh everyone goes to the gym when in real life i am the only person i know who has a membership even. my friends aren t doing weighted squats and pull ups so why am i beating myself up if i don t do that either? one reality check to go please ",
"how to keep recovering when you have a lack of appetite from covid?. i tested positive for covid and of course the harshest symptom i got was a complete lack of appetite. i genuinely forgot to eat for two days straight because i had zero hunger pangs or any sort of acknowledgment from my body that it needed food. the idea of eating was so nauseating that i couldn t even eat an entire saltine cracker; it took me a good 2 minutes to eat one of those tiny bowls of mashed potatoes from kfc. i ended up settling for nutritional drinks despite having to take those slow, too but i don t really love them and could use any suggestions on foods that are somewhat enjoyable and easy on the stomach. i know nutrition is a key part of covid recovery but it s really fucking hard when my brain doesn t want food and my body doesn t want to keep food down especially considering i ve consequently lost weight. this has been a huge mess for both myself and my mental health, any help is v much appreciated :, ",
"exercise is driving me insane. i feel like i'm still not fully in recovery partially because of the fact that i'm still forcing myself to exercise, but i don't know how to stop. it's not about losing or even maintaining weight at this point, it's just about doing 'enough' to the point where it's kind of obsessive. i tried not exercising at the beginning of recovery for a while around 2 weeks but it made me miserable and i quickly started again. i do sometimes exercise purely out of joy but most of the time it's feeling like i have to, and i always force myself to do at least one activity a day. i know this isn't healthy because i always feel too tired, i get upset over it and it stops me from enjoying things i otherwise might rollerblading, dancing etc. i just don't know what to do. i feel like i can't get out of this mindset because it's 'to meet the minimum i need each day'. i'm just really worried i won't want to do any kind of movement if i don't force myself amd i'm scared it'll damage my health if i don't enough. does anyone have any advice? thank you",

"this really is never ending isn't it. i've been struggling with anorexia since i was 14, coming now to my tenth anniversary on and off with the last three years spent recovering. despite only beginning my recovery process out of need i had to take care of my family and i couldn't do it if i nearly fainted every time i stood up over time i started putting effort and energy into my recovery, instead of just pushing my ed away and slipping into other addictions. a week ago i looked at myself in the mirror for the first time since i was a child and actually thought that i looked okay, that my body was not only acceptable but beautiful, i am eating whatever i want with only paying mind to when i'm full actually hungry. i thought it meant that i was done, but now i'm fixating more and more with the way i look, with what and how much i eat, looking with envy at the people that surround me. my closest friend is also in ed recovery although she's still way deeper into it than i want to be and we both just met someone who was hospitalized for an ed, so seeing the way this person looks behaves is kind of triggering. i find myself consciously and knowingly wishing that i could go back to just let my ed take control. i feel stupid and frustrated and at this point am really starting to worry that i'll have to deal with this forever. i can't talk about this to anyone without triggering them or being treated like a crazy person, so this only festers inside my head.",
"im on my path of recovery but im in so much anxiety. hi all i've found this subreddit to be very helpful the past few days. it's a lot to read but i appreciate you a lot if you do. i'm 2 . i have been struggling with anorexia binge purge type for almost 6 years. in october 2 2 , i was referred to a program at my hospital to get checkups on my eating disorder. i was i'm major denial about being sick or needing help. none of my symptoms stopped. in early 2 21 there was some progress in my weight but symptoms were still there. this is possibly due to the fact that i had no therapist or full outpatient team because "" i was too busy"" like i said. i was constantly told i'd have to go to the hospital if i didn't stop and was recommend to go to php. i kept saying i was busy. and i still just didn't want help. when august 2 21 came around, i got worse. i felt my energy decreaing quicker, work performance was bad, i didn't return to college. i got into a relationship in which i let my insecurities get in. my boyfriend wasn't fully aware of my situation or what even an eating disorder was, so a lot of things were said that i took to heart badly. in october i started calling php programs and also residential programs for help, but was turned away because insurance. so i gave up. i quit my job in december, and decided to try and look for help again, but no luck. i thought i'd use the time off work to focus on recovery but i just kept getting sucked into the eating disorder more. frequent doctor visits and seeing that i was declining in weight more, i grew happy. i found a therapist but i didn't seem to care. until april 2 22. i almost passed out in a public place. an ambulance came and my blood pressure was low. i spent 4 days in the er. i realized something needed to change. that i didn't want to die but i also don't want to gain weight. i stopped binging and purging slowly but i still felt sick due to not eating at all. in may, i was at my lowest and decided to go into the hospital for refeeding as recommend by my doctor. i had called a residential place that had a admission date for me, but in the end didnt work because insurance. i ended up doing php from june 23rd up until a week ago, because i was told i needed a higher level of care, even though i know i've been eating my meals and not binging or purging. turns out i'm still loosing weight even if i'm eating. i'm not sure what to do. i want to get better and i don't want my weight to continue to fall. i just want to be healthy. i've seen my doctor but he said to go to residential possibility, and hell see me in 2 weeks. i am eating. i am doing my best. i know i need help and i'm looking for a new therapist and now a nutrionist. but i'm scared my weight won't go up for weight restoration. i'm scared the refeeding sydrome is still going on and now i have a hyper metabolism. i don't know if anyone can tell me if this is possible to fix at home. what should i do?",
"thought i was fully recovered until i stepped on the scale at the dr s office and realized my weight overshoot was going down.. in recovery, my bmi shot up into the slightly overweight zone. this was a big struggle for me, because my entire life having a bmi of 25 was my worst fear. at first i kept telling myself the overshoot would go down and i wouldn t have to worry about dealing with those thoughts anymore, but after a year of overshoot i kinda just accepted it and moved on. today, i got weighed for the first time in quite a while, and learned the overshoot is finally going down. the feeling of relief and satisfaction i felt upon learning i was no longer overweight feels like a big step back because prior to this i thought i was fully recovered or very nearly so . i almost felt proud , even though logically i know that having a lower weight isn t a merit to be earned. any tips on confronting this lingering disordered thinking?",

"hypoglycemia after 6 yrs with a restrictive ed. i've been in recovery for since early may, with a few slip ups that didn't really last long. i started recovery for multiple reasons, but one of the big ones being that i was suffering from pretty consistent hypoglycemia. if i didn't eat enough every few hours, my blood sugar would be too low and i'd get very very sick. it's gotten much better in recovery, but it hasn't gone away completely, and it's been a bit more difficult lately as my appetite has kind of decreased and i honestly forget to eat or just... don't focus on it bc i'm distracted thanks adhd, hyperfixations are just awesome s does anyone have any tips on managing it? and does this ever go away or is it a permanent thing? i notice it gets better, but then when i mess up and don't eat because i'm busy and want to keep doing what i'm doing, it feels so much worse than it was before. i dont know if that's actually true or if i just feel that way because my symptoms were being managed before and i just forgot how awful it feels when your blood sugar drops. i've been thinking of getting glucose tablets for when i'm not wanting to get up and eat, though i need to work on taking breaks from tasks n such bc my hyperfixations are unhealthy for sure but i'm not sure. would it be worth it to invest in a glucose monitor or talk to my doctor about doing some additional testing? i did my a1c levels and estimated blood glucose ? levels almost a year ago in august of 2 21.",

"worried about possibly unjustified extreme hunger. i m a college student who s very worried about the intense hunger i ve experienced since end of april . for context, i began going on a diet starting november of last year. i set a limit on calorie intake of around 17 calories. at first, i could manage the diet with willpower, but things soon went downhill. i started to have binging episodes once a week. there s a vending machine at my university dorm, and around 2 3am i would go there and buy candy and chips. feeling guilty, i tried to eat very little the next day. during winter break, i ate almost the same food items for breakfast 165 18 and then almost nothing else for the rest of the day. when school resumed, i tried maintaining my calorie restriction, but matters became worse. the foods i ate increasingly consisted of sweet, processed foods with clear calorie labels on them. towards the end of march, i decided to end my terrible dieting practices. i began eating as much as i wanted. but i soon noticed that i almost never felt full. no matter how much i ate for every meal and snack, i wanted to eat more. my constant hunger intensified in may, and ever since i would eat as much as two or three meals worth of food for each meal. i m writing because i m concerned about my health; i eat so much that i continue to rapidly gain weight, and i m worried this will eventually lead to obesity. i am nearing being overweight in the bmi range . i feel like i didn t restrict to an extreme degree while i was dieting. consequently, i don t understand why i m experiencing such intense hunger for such a long time. my lab results also don t indicate any underlying medical condition. tldr: i didn t heavily restrict while dieting, so my unending extreme hunger feels unjustified. i m afraid of what will happen to me if this continues.

"extreme hunger even when my stomach is uncomfortably full. i've been trying self recovery for about a month, and i think i've been doing pretty well. my extreme hunger was pretty intense the first week or two, but it's started mellowing out, now it just comes and goes. there's only like a 33 chance it'll be an extreme hunger day now, rather than a 99 chance like it was in the beginning. amp; x2 b; before i started recovery, i would only get hungry a few times a day, be able to eat maybe at most half a portion of something, and still be uncomfortable after every bit of food. since starting recovery, i've been hungry much more frequently, i've been able to up my portions noticeably i can eat almost a full portion now, and i make up for what i can't eat in snacks and drinks , and discomfort is more like a coin flip rather than a given. amp; x2 b; i'm proud of my progress, and my partner's noticed and has said they're proud of me as well. even though it's not really showing in my appearance yet, and i haven't weighted myself, i feel healthier. by that i mean, i no longer feel like i'm going to have a heart attack or faint all day every day while living basically sedentary. amp; x2 b; still though, i have days where my physical discomfort levels with eating feel the same as they did before recovery, and i have to force myself to eat through the discomfort. as well, the smell of food will make me nauseous. it feels like my stomach and my throat shrink, squeeze in and tense up. especially on days like today, where extreme hunger is present, this is the absolute worst. like my whole body is screaming at me to eat and eat and eat, but my stomach can barely handle a few bites of food. i want to eat, but the discomfort makes it hard. amp; x2 b; does anyone know how to cope with this? should i listen to my stomach discomfort even though it will result in a low calorie day? or should i honour the extreme hunger even though it'll make me feel physically uncomfortable and miserable? i want to do well in recovery, especially after a really bad health scare. the mentality is there, but some days the physical hardships make it feel like i'm going backwards. amp; x2 b; also, please do not mention anything about refeeding syndrome or the like i have severe hypochondria, and it's already hard pushing through recovery with the constant fear of refeeding syndrome and recovery symptoms complications.

"thigh gap life gap. this even feels corny typing out but i m trying to do some reframing. with my body changing thanks to recovery, i m noticing my thigh gap slowly disappearing. when i was actively disordered i took a lot of pride in the achievement of a thigh gap, especially because i d convinced myself that it would be physically impossible for me to achieve. i believed i d beaten my own biology by getting one and i honestly didn t realize how much sick pride i got from it until it began to go away. so i m trying to reframe its presence as something negative. when i had a thigh gap, especially a very noticeable one, my life was as empty as the space between my legs. having a thigh gap was a representation of the cavern my ed left in my life. it meant gaps in memory, gaps in energy, gaps in relationships with others. the distance between my legs was a direct indication of my distance from my goals, my values, my family and my friends. filling that space has meant filling my life with joy, positive memories, new love and old love rekindled. so seriously, which would i rather have? an empty space and an empty life, or a full life with legs that happen to touch eachother? seems a little silly to even think that s a competition.",

"we are lucky in a way. i was thinking today about the fact that consciously recovering gives us the opportunity to actively and intentionally rewire our thought processes and behaviors around food, so that with effort and a true desire to do so, we can become clean of food issues. this is really an opportunity that many people don t have. people without ed s are often still weird about food, and i would say nearly everyone is at best quirky when it comes to eating, weight control, whatever. it is ingrained in our culture to make food almost a hobby how and what we eat is in many ways an identity even for non disordered people. we have this chance, because we re forced to, really, to get away from all of that and become free of food issues. or even if not entirely free, at least aware and conscious about behaviors around food, identity construction etc. it s almost like having had an ed and then coming out the other side is a chance to be more healthy and sane around food than the general population. and definitely more educated anyway ",

"option for hloc or staying at a lower level wondering if anyone else has experienced this?. hi all for background, i am in my early twenties and currently in iop following an an relapse. i ve been at my current program for about six weeks and have made some really good progress, but i ve also somewhat plateaued and am still engaging in a range of ed behaviors. my treatment team is recommending i spend a couple weeks at a hloc as sort of a tune up jump start as they feel discharging me with my current frequency using certain behaviors could be very risky. i am a student, and they re concerned that without extra intervention i ll backslide at the start of the school year. me and my outpatient team were all somewhat surprised by this suggestion as i have generally been eating adequate amounts each day even with some restriction compulsive exercise for example, might restrict at a meal but overall intake for the day is good, or might make ed driven food choices but they still minimally meet my meal plan, or do some compulsive exercise but at low frequency intensity . my outpatient team basically said this would be a somewhat unusual step up in treatment bc it wouldn t be the result of me doing super badly in iop but instead a sort of safeguard method to get me doing even better and get out of this stuck zone. iop team confirmed that i m very compliant and engaged and that a some things are going well, they just see areas i m still struggling and that they think would be good to improve. my op team definitely hasn t discouraged me from trying a hloc but agreed with me that it might not be necessary and that this is ultimately my choice based on what i think will help me and whether i m willing to engage with the process. i m not opposed to trying a hloc for a short period because i really truly want to recover, but i m also concerned being at a hloc will surround me with people who are much sicker in a way that will be really distressing or something. i also feel a bit resentful towards my iop team that what im doing now isn t good enough and don t like the idea of putting myself in a position with less autonomy. has anyone been in this position before? if so, how did you respond? or if not, suggestions after reading through my ramble? i also want to acknowledge that, as someone with an ed, i am by definition not an objective judge of my behavior bc i m biased towards minimizing and my ed fights very hard to maintain it s control. i think a lot of my confusion indecision now is because my op team agrees this isn t absolutely necessary, which has left me uncertain how to proceed.",

"waking up to eat every night. hi everyone. so i ve been in a weird quasi recovery about 6 months, but the last two weeks after being threatened with residential and losing my op team i decided to really commit. i ve increased my intake each week, which the monitoring of my dietitian. however, i wake up every single night hungry. if i don t eat, i can t fall asleep. i m getting worried i m training my body to wake up to eat. i ve increased me caloric intake during the day and i eat a snack right before bed. has anyone else dealt with this?? it s very distressing",
"reminder that ""its only okay to eat if i eat slow"" is also a food rule.. i see a lot people in recovery and the intuitive eating sub, haha seeking advise on ""how to eat slower"" or ""how to eat without distraction"". when i was in beginning of my ed recovery i didn't even relise that this is indeed a food rule. i wanted to eat slow so badly so i could enjoy my food really i just hoped i would eat less if i ate slower sure, its nice to sit down once in a while to eat slow, but if everytime you eat ""too fast"" makes you spiral or angry at yourself, then its a food rule that has to be challenged. its okay to eat while distracted. its okay to eat super fast. you dont have to put your fork down between every bite. you are hungry. eat however you want. lt;333",

struggling bride to be. for the past year or two i ve been working really hard at not hating my body and not restricting myself. when i got engaged i knew that the lead up to my wedding was going to be a tough time because of all of the shedding for the wedding bs and pressure that s put on brides to look their best on the big day but up until now i had mostly been able to tune that out and stay positive. i m getting married in 6 weeks and out of nowhere today it hit me like a ton of bricks that i m going to be the heaviest i ve been in years on my wedding day. i literally haven t been able to think about anything else and am feeling so shitty about the fact that tens of thousands of dollars are being spent to make this day special and all i care about is how i m going to look. these are photos i m going to look at for the rest of myself and i don t want to only remember how bad i felt about myself that day. if anyone can relate or give some advice or encouragement i could really use it.,
"can you recover without going to a treatment center?. hello all, very nervous to be posting this, but i would really love some advice on this. i ve had an eating disorder for fourish years now, and have been in php twice and tried and failed to go to residential once. none of this helped me recover at all, and i always ended up worse than i started. i have the opportunity to go to a residential in a few days, if i say yes. problem is, im terrified to my fucking core. i tried to go to residential before, and as stated, didn t last two hours. i had a full breakdown and begged and cried for my mom to pick me up, and she did. this wasn t because i didn t want to recover, and not because i didn t appreciate the help, but because i genuinely couldn t handle anything about the way res is set up. i had severe separation anxiety as a kid and have autism, so these two things could be factors, although anxiety is generalized anxiety and not separation anxiety now. i want to recover, i really do. but i ve had no luck with an outpatient team for the past year and im doing worse and worse. if i didn t go, what do i do? how do i escape this hellish disorder? i really don t think that i can ever mentally handle res, or even php anymore for that matter. i ve never felt the kind of panic i do at even the mere mention of treatment. i lose all feeling in my body and hyperventilate for hours. i literally sobbed for 6 hours straight at php before i dropped out, with absolutely no breaks. any advice would be so so so appreciated",

"can hunger ""stack up"" even in small amounts of restriction?. maybe a dumb question but it is suuuper frustrating. basically even though i have mostly been honoring my hunger, i still do small restrictions for example not getting seconds, only having one two full meal s during the day and eating something ""lighter"" for dinner even though i am trying my best i still feel like there is only a certain amount i can eat during the day and i cannot exceed that, and limiting the number amount of something i eat like the number of cookies, plates of food and etc. and every day instead of getting better my hunger has been getting worse, i have important exams and stuff and all i can think about is food. i am sitting in the kitchen munching on a bag of peanuts rn. i am scared to fully take the control because i have no external support. is it because i have not been honoring it fully or is that a small amount that would not affect it?",
"when is it okay to start applying gentle nutrition just make healthier options?. i m doing really well food wise, i pretty much just eat whatever the hell i want and have fear foods, but at what point will it be okay for me to start applying gentle nutrition or opting for healthy options etc. because honestly i feel like shit. my mom and dads side of the family both have issues with blood sugar and a high sugar consumption has big effects on my mood, energy, etc. my mom and i also retain water very easily, if i have too much sodium and not enough water or potassium, i wake up the next day and my face looks like a circle . i want to make decisions in my diet that will make me feel good internally, externally, not make me feel bloated 24 7 not fun and just overall make me more happy and energetic, but at the same time i don t want to fall into orthorexic tendencies. if anyone further into their recovery has any advice or experience i would greatly appreciate it ",

"weight gain in recovery and how stupid the fitness industry is.. so over the last two years i f have focused a lot of energy on tackling my ed which i have had since 2 16. it took a very long time for me to adjust my appetite and relationship to food and exercise i used to exercise a crazy amount and passed out in a lot of dangerous situations because i wasn't eating enough before exercising . i had to quit the gym outdoor workouts and focused only on yin yoga and meditation, which was a great idea and helped me clear up a lot of old injuries. once i was able to stabilize myself i turned to focusing on eating more and consuming nutrient dense high calorie meals and snacks. my body mass increased by 15 and most of it was fat because i was not doing muscle building or cardiovascular workouts. omg the differences are insane changing my body on purpose in the opposite direction people usually go also opened my eyes to how dumb the average person myself included is when it comes to health and fitness. 1 people are shocked when they found out i intentionally gained weight and stopped exercising. at the risk of sharing my personal information or sounding bitter i usually steer the conversation in another direction, but it's ridiculous how judgemental a lot of people can be. they act like choosing to focus on gaining weight and resting are a moral failure. it's extra hilarious when they are condescending to me about fitness because i used to be a triathlete and a personal trainer. i can still do one handed pushups. usually this attitude comes from men amp; not women. it takes literally everything in me not to just drop down into a set of 1 handed pushups or contortion when these people try to lecture me about the importance of strengthening or whatever. 2 coming out of the fog of fitness culture and doing what was right for me to get my health back on track so i wouldn't suddenly go into cardiac arrest from a brisk walk showed me how many fitness people are liars i used to be focused on my own workouts so never really cared or paid attention to the kinds of crap people said they did every week to stay fit i also did some pretty extreme stuff so it didn't faze me if someone said they did something extremely unhealthy . so many times i would join a workout group amp; people would tell me about how they never came later than 5 am to train, but when i showed up at 5 am no one would be there or when a guy told me he played basketball for 3 hours every morning but couldn't even do basic body weight exercises that anyone who works out for that long should be able to do. i don't mean to body shame or diminish someone's athletic ability but if you are blatantly lying about something you should be able to prove easily, that is laughable. it's also extremely dangerous to tell others that you can and regularly do such unhealthy things when you don't, because that normalizes extreme behavior i feel terrible for people who have no education on fitness hearing from these jokers in the gym or on the court about their unrealistic regimens when the only extreme thing they really do is take steroids and spend 2 per month on supplements. 3 in terms of my happiness, having extra chub is way healthier than being underweight. i got back into the gym recently and i'm able to keep up with a lot of my old exercise routines from when i was actively anorexic. i have more energy now than ever and can do intense workouts for longer than i could when i was skinny. i'm actually afraid of losing too much weight now because having extra fat storage makes me feel so much more comfortable and my heart is definitely thanking me during cardio workouts 4 people take my ideas more seriously now that i am not extremely thin and waifish. i don't know what that is, if it's my confidence or my appearance or both. i have a bachelor's degree in finance and am working on a graduate degree in statistics. i'm pretty smart, but before i took my health seriously the real way, not the compulsive and constant shaming way i had no confidence, which wasn't helped by my brain fog from poor diet i used to be shy about myself and afraid of everyone. even when i tried to project confidence, i was extremely nervous and insecure. i also got hit on a lot by really gross guys. i always felt like they weren't attracted to me or even my appearance so much as the idea of having a skinny blonde reciprocate their advances or maybe even go out with them. i sometimes wonder where all the compliments went but really i'm glad to be rid of guys that would harass an insecure and malnourished young woman constantly. 5 the amount of shame that gets thrown at people for whatever their body looks like. i just googled the words ""skinny fat vs toned"" and it's fucking hilarious. the pictures they show are of normal people who probably have a reasonable exercise regimen but the accompanying articles are shaming them for not being fit as if everyone on planet earth has 4 hours per day to work out and looks exactly the same at every point of their life. most of the pictures even appear to be the same person, just taken before and after an intense run or at a different angle. it's so sad that this kind of trash writing is readily available to people who are probably trying to research reasonable ways to improve their health. it reminds me of when i was anorexic and people said that i ""looked great"" even though i was extremely unhealthy. luckily in my detox from being deep in the fitness industry i've found some body positive health and fitness writers like the body coach who simply promote eating and exercising in a way that makes you feel healthy and confident in your athletic ability. it really makes me so upset to see the amount of misinformation out there about health and fitness, and i think these lies contribute to lack of athletic confidence in the general adult population. it's such a shame that these fitness rags and shitty food blogs encourage people towards yo yo dieting and body shame so that they can make money off of weird diets and home gym equipment that doesn't work.",
"it s not natural to count calories. please remove this if this goes against sub rules as humans, it s not natural to count and restrict our calories as humans, naturally, we eat what our body needs. all bodies come in different sizes and have different metabolic requirements. the whole reason we started dieting is because of stupid trends that become norms and expectations of certain people, and in order to look like that, some people have to change their lifestyle to something that is unnatural to their self, their body. unfortunately due to this disordered behaviour, our brain becomes confused because we re not giving it what it knows it needs i m saying this as a sort of wake up call for myself and anyone who might benefit from this. there s a lot to say about overweightness and underweightness but those factors are purely due to internal issues that stem from these stupid cosmetic trends and unrealistic beliefs and they manifest into their own problems. sorry if this was really unstructured, i m rambling and needed to get it out edit: an honourable mention to research is the vagus nerve. this nerve connects the brain directly to the stomach and is responsible for hunger cues. i think it s a very interesting and worthwhile topic to read about. it s the reason we feel endless hunger after a period of starvation, why we lose our hunger signals and why we have to listen to our body and not what we re trying to force our brain to believe we need.",

"in a lot of physical pain from satisfying my mental hunger. hello just reaching out for some support, i'm sure others have been in this position before when honouring our extreme hunger so please share your experiences and what has helped you feel better in the past so today i woke up especially ravenous the very first thing on my mind was food, which is normal to me at this point but after 14 months of eh it had started to fade to being the 2nd or even 3rd thing i think of with an extreme extreme day once a week and i immediately knew it was going to be an especially hungry day. just fine by me, my body knows what it needs lol so i went downstairs, made myself a very creamy coffee and drank it as i toasted some waffles, i had 6 waffles with lots of butter, nutella, maple syrup and 2 bananas. i then waited half an hour and got started on some work and had to stop due to intense hunger pains, i felt completely empty, again normal to me... so i had 2 big bowls of cereal, cucumber and cheese and mayo sandwiches, a family bag of doritos and then some cubes of cheese on their own. feeling good again so i did some more work for 2 hours being able to think about work and not just food. 2 hours pass and man i'm hungry... i snack on raisins and trail mix and m amp;ms as i make pesto pasta with chicken and have it with lots and lots of slices of garlic bread. then i have some tablespoons of peanut butter slowly out of the jar as i finish up my work. i decide to do some of my hobbies but all i can think of is food mental hunger so i have a big hot chocolate with whole milk, marshmallows and whipped cream, and then once i have some more room in my stomach i have a tub of b amp;js, a tangerine for some reason, some waffle fries, i make a bacon sandwich with a fried egg and have that, a few cheese strings since i had really bad cheese cravings today, and then a few more bowls of cereal and some olives out of the jar. then i also had a bag of haribos and some rhubarb crumble with custard anyway... now i'm laying here and it feels very very painful for me to move and i can't stand up without feeling like i'm going to involuntarily throw up. i'm laying in the recovery position to make digestion easier but i'm in a lot of pain, taking little sips of water and trying to watch stuff to distract myself. i was genuinely hungry for everything i ate today and mentally i feel satisfied and finally don't have the desire to eat anything else but boy are the stomach cramps real. i have super bad acid reflux as well any kind words? experiences? i've had discomfort during recovery a bunch of times but this is probably the most full i've physically felt in a long time.",

"what s the difference between mental and emotional hunger cravings?. i get regular physical hunger cues, and i m not super underweight early in recovery. i eat the recommended calories for someone of my sex, height, weight, and activity level to maintain. however, i also am constantly thinking about food. i am chronically stressed with work, so i m scared that i really just want to stress eat. but i can t focus on anything besides food, and it s awful. i have to constantly be eating drinking something to focus, so i end up drinking exorbitant amounts of diet soda and eating a bunch of little snacks instead of proper meals because i just want to be consuming something all the time. i m disgusted with myself. my dietician says it s mental hunger, but i think it s just me being stressed, needing sensory input from chewing, and enjoying the taste of food too much. i m so busy that food is the only pleasure comfort i have time for because i can eat while i work. i just don t know what to do.",
"i made breakfast without measuring it out today. this sounds really simple i know but small steps are as important as big ones, right? i used to obsessively count calories and then i moved to macros and didn t realize all i had done was move to one disorder to another so today i just made some microwave oatmeal, grabbed a handful of fruit at random and made myself some hello kitty tea which i hadn t been drinking because of the carbs, even though it s such a small amount and it feels weirdly freeing i also want lucky charms after this. i ve had some left over for too long now and i really want lucky charms",

"idk i can keep going. i have been all in for about 2 weeks now. the first two weeks were great until yesterday. i put on one of my shirts and it was tight, which led to a huge downward spiral. i weighed myself and i was not happy. i had terrible body image. this caused me to heavily restrict and i even went to the gym and did cardio. i told myself that it wasnt for punishment but its very hard to trick your brain. this also made my hunger worse and i wouldnt allow myself to eat dinner until i was full. i stopped eating when the ed voice told me i had enough. i feel like im just setting myself back but im within a healthy weight bmi and i just feel like im gonna gain weight until im fat again i lost a lot of weight over the past year and a half . i also havent told my parents because im a male and i just feel like no one will listen. how do i keep going",

how do non ed people even eat. idek how to phrase this question but for stuff like peanut butter. i need to measure the exact amount that i m allowed to have each day which tbh isn t a great quantity but otherwise i legit cannot eat it even if it looks like it s less than my quota. but regular people can just get some and spread it around without knowing how much they re having??????????? how??? i feel like idek how much a regular person eats and i m so confused. how much is too much?? too little?? how will anyone know ,

"hypothalamic amenorrhea period loss when to see a doctor?. so i know amenorrhea can really affect your bone density and possibly lead to osteopenia. a little less than a year ago i went to the doctor about ha, and she basically told me that if my period was gone for more than 8 months then my bones may be at risk, but until then i shouldn t worry. i began recovery around november of last year, and my period returned in january. by that point my period had been gone since july, so about 6 months total. my period was relatively stable until a recent relapse, and now i haven t had it since april, so roughly 3 months. if it s relevant i ve also always had really normal periods pre ed i ve been tracking them for years and it was extremely rare that they were ever even a day late in the past. anyway, at this point i m just wondering if this is something worth going to the doctor over? osteopenia is one of the only medical complications that i m genuinely worried about since it s not reversible. i never lost my period for 8 consecutive months so i m not sure if i m at risk, but at the same time i know my gp and most gps in general wasn t exactly well versed in eating disorders. if anyone has any experience seeing a doctor for hypothalamic amenorrhea or getting a bone dexa scan, what was your experience like? at what point does it make sense to get one?",
"a year in recovery how tf do i get back into exercising?. hey guys about a year ago i finished an intensive outpatient recovery program. i had non purging bulimia, so my way of compensation was always exercising. it s been a year, and i m heavier but feel so much better mentally and feel normal while eating however, i am so out of shape. i used to be able to sprint to catch busses, climb a ton of stairs, run for miles, etc. now, i sorta just dislike my body because it only causes me issues, and because i m not using it to do things, i get depressed about it. but the only reason i ve ever wanted to be healthy in the past was for weight loss back when i was disordered, an active fit body was a perk of the main thing. and it s totally been worth it rooting it out of my life, but i really want my heart and body to be healthy again. i understand that exercising requires routine, but every time i exercise i get so sad about the fact that i m out of shape, and exercising turns into a hugely emotional thing for me. and like, i genuinely don t like moving or exercising. there s nothing in it for me, except long term health. i m far more entertained with my mind and projects than i am with like.. running. but i want to run and be active. and usually i would simply focus on the weight loss benefits of it and that would motivate me to action, but i don t have that anymore. tldr: i need to find a way to want to exercise, but i ve only ever wanted to exercise because of my body. does anyone have any advice ",

help answering. this post may or may not make sense since it s kinda hard to explain but i have this sorta thing where i don t let myself start a new day of eating until i have slept for at least 7 hours. what i mean by this is that i restrict myself to eat a certain amount of calories in one day and start a new day of eating until i ve slept at least 6 hours because for me that s when my body has refreshed its calories for that day. this wouldn t be a problem if i wasn t gonna be traveling all day airport so i won t be able to sleep at all and i m gonna probably restrict myself from eating all day until i ve slept 7 full hours. it sounds stupid but yea. if anyone can help like debunk this or something it would probably stop me from restricting.,

"satisfying the urge to log calories by logging other habits. i ve tried to quit tracking calories many times over the years. but i could never shake that horrible i m forgetting something vitally important inkling after eating without logging it. it s like the same sixth sense of leaving the oven on. you can t go on with your day until you fix it. i started using an app to track my daily mood and habits meds, skincare, etc. and i didn t mean for it to do this, but the routine of logging something into my phone makes that feeling go away. it reminds me that i m not slipping behind by eating, and gives me concrete evidence of the productivity and healthy habits that i m encouraging by recovering. i don t track anything food related in my app because that is a little too familiar, but the motions of routinely clicking on a little icon and seeing my week in numbers ex: this week i read 4 days, took meds twice daily for 7 days finally made that you re forgetting something voice go away. i think some people might be critical of this because it can sound like i m trading one obsession for another, but tracking medication has very different outcomes than tracking calories imo. have other people have gotten over calorie apps using similar methods? if not, what worked for you?",

cannot stop once i start to eat. i found my myself delaying eating my first meal of the day from regular morning hours to noon and now to after 3pm because i can t stop eating once i start it s not physical hunger it never is. i doubt i m capable of having them anymore. it s just mental hunger that keeps telling me to eat and eat till i force myself to go to bed before 9 pm. magically tho i ve never felt any physical discomfort from eating non stop for hours. i mean yes my stomach would stick out a lot but i ve never been physically uncomfortable. guess i must be a truly bottomless pit.,

"advice for hair loss from anorexia and in recovery with extreme hunger?. hi all, so i just started a formal recovery from anorexia nervosa. one day i got home from exercise and a 2x2 inch square of hair had exited my scalp and i can t lie, it was at that moment that i grabbed the biggest bowl of reese s puff cereal with an enriched protein shake as the milk and like 6 protein bars and just went to town because i d had enough. i need my hair. so of course after a massive energy restriction, limitation of most food groups, and over exercise my body is really not having it and i am experiencing extreme hunger over the last month and doing my best to honor it it s really all carb, sweet, and fat cravings . the gain of mass on my body is really, really upsetting but i want to undo all the trauma i ve done to my body and be free more than anything. however, my hair keeps falling out. like a lot. my already weak ponytail is now looking more like the tip of a tapered paint brush for thin line work art. it s bad. my question is why is my hair still falling out so much? could honoring extreme hunger be a shock to my body that is making it worse? is this normal in recovery? will it stop soon? it s been over a month into physical recovery. honestly, i had mentally compensated with over exercise to feel better about honoring extreme hunger so perhaps that may have something to do with it from the stress of that? but i just herniated both my calfs so i can t even walk now so exercise, movement, and sport are off the table for a long time anyways. : maybe good tho for my hair.. : does anyone have any advice to keep my remaining hairs in my head? and to stop it from thinning and receding so much? or any key items or products to consume or use to get my hair healthier. shampoos, topicals, etc. my previously long, thick hair is a key part of what makes me feel beautiful and kept together and i don t know how to cope with the damage i ve done. edit: it also breaks off like nobody s business. i imagine from restriction that my existing hair will be weak especially at the top from malnourishment but dear god i just want it to at least stop falling out in clumps and thinning everywhere. fuck eating disorders lol.",
"my experience with fatphobia as a previously straight sized woman . talk of numbers tw ok so this might be a bit of a rant but i think it's really important to talk about how societal fatphobia impacts ed recovery and how it can hinder true freedom from our disorders in the worst ways. this is my experience but please share your own below it's important to realise we aren't alone in our struggles so basically i had an active ed with no remission for 5 years between the ages of 19 24. it was basically ednos, but i started in a midsized body and at the turning point when i decided to recover, i was a few pounds underweight but very very physically unwell from lax abuse, overexercising and years of binge restrict cycles. my body was suffering but all i got at the time was praise for how beautiful and model like i look... i was fainting, my bloodwork was terrible and i shat myself a few times tmi but all society cared about is that my mildly uw body fit beauty standards. and i was asked what my secret was and how i did it multiple separate times i began recovery, all in approach, and experienced extremely extreme hunger. i'm over a year in now and still experiencing extreme hunger, and in that time i've """"overshot"""" and ended up in an """"""obese bmi"""""" body. my bmi is now 32 and there is no sign of my extreme hunger stopping anytime soon... every day, i am still eating between 5 8 kcal in the first 6 months it was a lot more and i am genuinely ravenous for this amount honouring my hunger and accepting my body has been so freeing. i don't love my body now, but i don't hate it either. i think of it neutrally, and i'm grateful every day that i no longer pass out or feel weak and my bloodwork is perfect. i'm happy to gain even more if my body feels it is necessary the issue has been... society. my weight gain has been treated like it makes me a failure. when i've been open about my past ed, i've gotten comments about how i've ""swung the other way"" and how ""being overweight is unhealthy too, you know."" i've even had people say to me, the nerve, that i looked better before and what happened? in the first 6 months of recovery i had both friends and strangers ask me if i was pregnant me healing my relationship with my body has been seen in a very negative light, because i was society's ideal and decided that the pain it put my body through wasn't worth it. as someone who was previously straight sized, i realise how many issues plus sized women face in today's society... strangers will comment on what and how much i eat, i catch thinner women staring at my stomach and then glancing away, embarrassed, when i catch them doing it. me wearing a bikini is now ""brave"" when before it was not worth mentioning. all of these new findings have made me realise how fatphobic society is and how so many people would honour their hunger more if they weren't afraid of this reaction what are your experiences? thoughts and feelings? : gt;",

when did you stop beign in denial?. like many people with eating disorders i spent many years in denial about my condition. it was really triggering for me to hear people talking about eds and i even convinced myself that what i was doing was perfectly normal. when i relapsed really badly last year i had no choice but to admit it and try to seek treatment,
"motivational comment from family. i often have my doubts and think that i eat too much, and ed thoughts of restriction always pop up and i ""feel"" worse than when i was actively restricting. today, however, i noticed i feel happier? i always really look forward to everything i eat now, even if it is chocolate, ice cream, salmon, potato, oatmeal, carrots, bananas, pasta, whatever it is and apparently, despite my ed ""feeling"" stronger than ever, i noticed i'm more energetic and more ""optimistic"" despite still obsessing about all things food. admittedly there's the compulsive exercise, but at least now i have more energy and feel less fatigued when exercising. even though my recovery isn't all in, and i honestly fail to meet the minimum guidelines for minnie maud, i still eat a lot. and the one thing that cements my commitment to never going into full restriction again, is that my mom commented that i ""look and act happier, less grumpy, and that it's nicer to be around me"". how others perceive me, i didn't even think about. i didn't think that my starved self was any less fun to be around, but lo and behold, eating good food makes you a better person to everyone struggling with eds; if you fail to find motivation to recover some days, try to think that other people will probably enjoy your company a lot more if you aren't starved, because you'll most likely be a happier person, regardless of how the ed makes you feel ",

"please help me how do i give myself extreme hunger??. i'm really really struggling so any advice would be really appreciated i've been in recovery for the last 2 years. at beginning of my recovery, i was given a week left to live and was at the lowest point in my life. after months of ip, i was discharged at a still uw bmi but not severely so and given therapy to gain the rest in op. my therapist gave me a minimum meal plan for weight gain but also said to ""follow your extreme hunger"" and eat anything else i want on top of it. the minimum meal plan was 35 kcal. the thing is, i felt absolutely stuffed on the minimum meal plan and i had to force myself to eat it all. i think being in the state i was fucked up my hunger cues because i don't seem to have the capacity to feel hunger anymore... i'm not bragging, this makes me feel deeply sad because i just want to be normal and leave this ed behind. but i had to set alarms to remind myself to eat my planned snack or meal because i didn't think about food at all or feel hungry. i started doing this when a few days in a row i realised it was 6pm and i hadn't eaten anything yet and then had to eat all the calories in a very short period of time, which made me feel so so ill. idk if this is related but i have autism, and will get very fixated on my hobbies and only think about those for hours. even at my worst ed wise i rarely thought about food, i just wouldn't eat because my ed was about unaliving myself due to my c ptsd, it wasn't about being a certain weight. now that i've dealt with how to manage my trauma better i want to live a full life but despite a year and a half of therapy and op i am struggling to maintain a minimally healthy weight due to lacking hunger cues. i feel like i constantly have to micromanage myself to make sure i'm not accidentally undereating and it's exhausting. how do i give myself extreme hunger? i'd love to just gain until i'm solidly in the mid or upper healthy bmi or higher than that here are things i've already tried: having my really wonderful girlfriend help prep me 1 k calories worth of food snacks every day for 2 weeks and forcing myself to finish as much as physically possible in an attempt to reawaken my hunger cues the theory was i simply wasn't eating enough to be hungry but at no point during this experiment did i feel hungry for any of the food or even look forward to it... i just felt ambivalent switching antidepressants to one's which are linked with increased appetite",

"seeking reassurance advice for all in.. so i ve been all in for two months and i ve been eating so much in this time period, that i m now over my pre ed highest weight however my extreme mental hunger is still very prevalent. usually i m a very logical person even when it comes to my ed, and i ve always believed that all in is the best way for me to truly recover after being in quasi for 2 years. but now i m having doubts, due to my eating habits. i m worried that it s turning into binge eating rather than just honoring extreme hunger. here are a few of the reasons why i think it may not be extreme hunger anymore: 1. i almost always eat more in private, after having eaten a already large meal with my family. for example, i ll eat dinner with my family and eat till satiety, but as soon as i m in my room i ll start eating the snacks i have in my room. 2. i find it very hard to enjoy food atm and even when i m listening to my mental hunger, it s as if i m not enjoying the foods i m eating and i get no real satisfaction from eating the things i crave . 3. every evening i have what i until recently called eating feasts , but i now think that they may be binges. i m not restricting during the day and after dinner i ve already eaten thousands of calories, so there is no reason for my body to crave almost sometimes more than a full days worth of food. like i mentioned i m usually a very logical person, and i acknowledge that i sometimes have a tendency to mentally restrict compulsive and uncontrollable calorie counting, fearing high fat foods, all or nothing mindset etc. , but i m just finding it so hard to trust the process right now. i know i ve only been all in for 2 months, but it just feels so wrong at the moment and i can t seem to convince myself that i should keep going. i know this is a bit of a brain dump and may not make sense, but i would just really like to hear others experiences with this or get any advice on how to navigate these emotions. i hope this makes sense, and i apologize if this isn t fitting appropriate in this subreddit.",

"i feel alone and ironically so small. half of me wants nothing more than to not care what other people think. i understand that people on the street don't actually care and aren't judging me and that i genuinely shouldn't care about the ones who do because if they're judging someone else in the fifteen seconds they see them than their opinion doesn't really matter. i know logically that although i am certainly overweight, i'm not obese nor am i a danger to myself. in fact, my self perception of myself is probably exaggerated. i have a multitude of external factors that feed into my comfort eating. my therapist supports me, doesn't believe i'm endangering myself, and in fact wants me to understand that my worries are groundless. the other half of me tells me that actually, logically, i am fat and lazy and all my reasoning is me making excuses for myself. it wants me to go to horrible forums and pro ana twitter or tumblr accounts to show me that i'm stupid and wrong and that i'm not even good enough to have the 'good' eating disorder. and then the first half says i'm being cruel to sufferers and survivors of restrictive eating disorders and that actually i do have a restrictive eating disorder as well even if i don't look it. and then the other half says i'm being narcissistic and fat and lazy. i wish society had more leniency towards people with eating disorders who look like me, but then my wonderful brain has to bash me over the head and tell me i'm making excuses for myself. i'm just exhausted.",

"extreme hunger and letting go of restriction experiences in recovery. hey guys i m in recovery ish from anorexia and it s been a bumpy road so far. i ve kind of been relapsing lately and since trying to recover a lot of conflicting voices are more present now, more than ever. firstly, there s the ana voice telling me to restrict. secondly, there s the recovery voice telling me i deserve food and should eat more despite being terrified of weight gain. third, there s now this feeling of unstoppable desire to eat anything and everything and a lot of it. i ve read about others who ve experienced the same; extreme hunger. i feel like there hasn t been a lot of official research on extreme hunger so i have conflicting thoughts on what the right thing to do is. tabitha farrar wrote a blog post https: tabithafarrar.com 2 17 2 anorexia recovery eating on the topic, encouraging recovering anorexics to let go of all forms of restricting, to let your body have as much food as you want in recovery. she writes about honoring you body and mind when it tells you to eat entire cakes or jars of peanut butter, for as long as your body wants it. she explains that, at least for her, the extreme desire for food settles after a while. i m curious if any of you guys have any experience with this? what i m terrified of, besides weight gain , is it turning into bed or bulimia the latter is kind of the case for me now, after i ve gained some weight in my semi recovery . if you have time, check out the post she wrote i linked it further up and comment your thoughts ",

"despite all the struggles i have a win to share. sometimes i post things here that make it seem like i am close to relapsing lol maybe at those moments i am, but when i come back to my senses i weigh out the pros and cons and ed never wins the pros. of course it is not as easy as just thinking about whether it is good or bad so i spend a lot of time thinking about it, and it is not always pretty. but i am proud to say that i haven't body checked or looked at calorie labels for around a week now the only counting i do is subconscious and i cannot stop that so i try my best to ignore it. today we ordered a chicken wrap with my friends while in university, i had an exam and a long day ahead of me and i knew i needed to eat well. i just said my order and ate it without even second thinking, it was soo delicious and i don't feel an ounce of guilt i'm also really dehydrated lately due to intense heat, so i've been eating lots and lots of watermelon lately without thinking about the calories or sugar. come on, it is watermelon if i cannot enjoy it this summer, what other joy is left? i will try my best to get as good as i can before going to south korea for my studies because i wanna enjoy the food there without feeling like shit, it will be the first time in my life trying authentic korean food. of course it is not my only main motivation for recovery but i sure as hell don't wanna miss that amazing chance ",

"feeling like recovery is too easy, or like i was never 'sick enough'?. so, to establish some background for myself. first things first: i'm eighteen and a cis guy, and i've been dealing with anorexia for, if my snapchat memories are to be believed, about a year now. i don't know how it started, in all honesty. i don't know if i made the conscious decision to begin starving myself one day, but that seems to be the case. when i was at my worst, i went days on end without eating anything not naming how long that was for obvious reasons , and when i'd deemed myself fit, i'd have a small bite to eat. again, i will not be saying how many calories for obvious reasons. i remember going to the gp at my lowest and them telling me if i continued on i'd be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in hindsight, i cannot fathom why i wasn't diagnosed there and then, my weight, eating habits, and over exercising should've been more than enough for a formal diagnosis . i never made the mental decision to recover, i didn't go through the motions i am now, i just sorta started eating more, and i don't know if i even had an issue with it. i went back a few times; on all subsequent visits i had gained weight but can't remember what was said regarding the mental portion of the ed, if anything at all. months later and i was still doing this. i remember ordering lunch from caffe nero on a delivery app but ordering nonetheless without issue, ordering and eating a whole pizza without guilt nor an afterthought, grabbing each flavour of starbuck's christmas lattes over the holidays and talking with a friend about our favourites. during this i had started going to the gym, but was not counting calories or anything, though i was still restricting; eating less to compensate, adding up all the calories burned at the end of my cardio, like those habits were clawing their way back. then the same thing happened again, and i fell into the habit of eating less, this time with a larger focus on eating 'clean', a slight interest in calorie calculating, and exercising even more. i'd wake up at 5am, eat overnight oats and a banana, go to the gym and run until i had shin splints, then i'd get home and have homemade jam on toast with fruit. i think i still ate dinner as well i wasn't starving myself as badly, but i was eating well below my bmr, if i had to guess. and recently i started really being inane with my calorie counting. i haven't gone to the gym in a month or so but still haven't been eating enough, i haven't weighed myself in ages either, i sorta stopped after gaining some weight back again. now i'm at the point where i've been researching recovery, i've been trying to eat more the past few days while still counting calories though still eating less than i should and i've been challenging some fears of mine. but i feel like this is too... easy? for me? don't get me wrong; i am unabashedly fucking afraid of gaining weight and to go through this journey, there are so many foods and things that scare me and that i haven't eaten in so long, and there is so much i know i'm going to have to deal with in terms of recovering and my body adapting, i'm already feeling some of them and i don't think i'm even eating close to enough. if it's this... i don't even know. if i'm this ambivalent towards recovering was i ever even sick enough or am i blowing all of this out of proportion?",
"how to stop comparing my intake to others. i can t help but feel shame and guilt after eating more than others, esp if they re taller or more active than me : i feel as if i m greedy. as if i can t be actually hungry if they re full after that. as if i m just binging bored. my extreme hunger is also mostly mental as well which just reinforces my doubts. now i know that it s technically normal to eat more than others in recovery but idk rlly. i ate more than everyone i know even pre ed and was often shamed for that. i always ate big portions, got dessert after, and snacked a lot. and i just don t get why i want to eat so much rn, i m overweight atp and my hunger is mental. i just can t bring myself to eat more, i try to eat as much as others around me so i don t overeat and hold myself accountable. yet my mind is consumed by food. idk what to do honoring my hunger doesn t seem like a way out bc i did it for more than 4 days, too and it didn t help,, i just gained a ton and am still as mentally hungry as ever. edit : gave into my eh right after i wrote this post how ironic and i feel worse than ever mentally rn either i fully commit to recovery, either i fully relapse and there s no in between for me; and i m honestly extremely conflicted on which option is best. it doesn t seem like it gets better mentally. i tried to stay positive until a certain point, but it became unbearable after a while. i m just stuck in the extreme hunger loop, over the span of forty days i didn t have a single one without extreme hunger. and that certainly sounds more like binging. days 1 17 were a mix of mental and physical hunger, but onwards from day 17 it became mental mainly but i still have the ability to consume large amounts of food that a normal person couldn t which leads me to thinking that my brain who has eating disorder tendencies used recovery as an excuse to switch to another form of an eating disorder, bed. i have all symptoms of binge eating disorder rn, there s no denying that. the eating abnormal amounts of food, the physical discomfort occasionally yet still proceeding to eat , eating in secret because i m shamed for eating a lot , the guilt that comes afterwards, the attempts to restrict the next day, the hatred towards myself, the suicidal thoughts, everything. classic. please do not tell me that this is extreme hunger, i may have had it at first but now i clearly am not experiencing it anymore.",

"should i go to treatment?. title is self explanatory lol, but i'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. i recently graduated college and just moved to a new city to start a new job, right in the middle of a pretty bad relapse. i know i need more support and accountability, but i also don't feel like i can leave my job because i just started and this is an incredible opportunity that i don't want to just throw away. i could potentially do iop with work been looking into within, the virtual program , but i don't know if they'll accept me for iop or if i need to go to res first or if they'd recommend php, which would be really hard to do with work . i've also talked briefly to my parents about treatment and they don't seem to think that going back to res would be helpful my mom said ""you always end up back in the same place, you need to learn how to live your life, not live it in treatment and then be thrown back out into the real world"" , which makes me think that i might be making a big mistake even thinking about all of this and am going to end up screwing myself over. i've also had some pretty negative experiences in treatment, which makes me scared to trust someone in that position again. i'm planning to apply to medical school next summer to start in the fall two years from now and desperately want recovery, but am really struggling with the internal motivation to make changes myself and feel like my outpatient team hasn't really been able to hold me accountable , especially when it comes to exercise and food. any and all advice is much appreciated, and thank you all so much this probably was super all over the place and i probably left out a lot of things too, so let me know if something i said doesn't make sense and sorry that this was so long.",

"advice needed: how to bounce back from unintentional restricting. i have been in recovery from me ed for about 7 years. i would like to say that i am close to being recovered, but unfortunately that is not the case. i'm getting there though. anyway...the reason for this post is to get some tips on how to bounce back from an unintentional restriction. here's the backstory. my self care is shit. i mean, complete shit. it's particularly bad when i get very busy or stressed. i work in human resources hr generalist and have recently acquired a hr manager my boss who, after a year and a half, still knows jack shit about how to do her job. prior to her arrival, i had no boss and had picked up a lot of the hr management tasks that i had hoped to pass back to another hr manager. however, since my current boss knows nothing after, again, a year and a half of being here, my workload has not been reduced. talks have been had with said manager, however, no progress has been seen. about 2 weeks ago, she coincidentally enough tested positive for covid on monday and would be out of the office the remainder of the week. i say ""coincidentally enough"" because that was the same week we were rolling out new incentive programs for our employees and meetings were being held at shift meetings which are at 7am and 7pm. well, needless to say, with her being out the task fell to myself and my co worker who is a recruiter with legit problems of her own. and before you say anything ... yes my hr department which consists of me and these 2 ladies is filled with a lot of drama that makes my life seem very boring. anyway, since my hr manager was out, this resulted in very longs days that stretched from 13 15 hours. i'm the type of person that when i get really busy, i legitimately forget to eat and then it gets too far my body is then like ""nope ... we're done..prepare to feel our wrath"" and then it goes downhill from there. i get exhausted, moody, emotional and any thought of food makes me sick to my stomach. i am then forced to choose the lesser of two evils ... 1 force down some sort of nourishment and risk throwing it back up unintentionally because i feel so icky or 2 continue on this path of no eating for fear of getting sick and sliding down the rabbit hole even farther and feel even more more icky. i have been trying for 2 weeks now to bounce back. i have been trying to eat regularly, even if i only finish half, that's better than none at all, but i'm still struggling. so, my dear redditors who i know have ridden or are riding this insane rollercoaster, can anyone provide me with tips? i was supposed to have a nutritional appointment today, but it got rescheduled for next week, so i'm just trying to keep my head above water until then. thank you in advance ",
"what to do after purging?. hello. so, uh, today didn't go as planned, and i ended up vomiting. i know there are already guides all over the internet on what to do after purging to take care of yourself. but the thing is, i don't have any electrolyte drinks, or baking soda, and all that stuff here at home, sadly and its already late for me to go out : so i would like to ask does anyone have any tips or ideas on what to do after purging if i don't have the abovementioned things? thank you all ",
"is it possible to recover extremely quickly? get ready for a bunch of questions: . this is my first comment ever on reddit so bear with me : . this site has been so informative, helpful and reassuring ever since i stumbled upon it about 6 weeks ago when i started recovery from anorexia. i am 5 6 and maintained a weight of about 1 3 1 7 for 6 years . i suffered from all the symptoms of anorexia light headedness, heart rate going from super low to super high, hair loss, lots of people commenting on my weight , obsessed with food, tired, blue fingers, always cold . anyway, i ve never been formally diagnosed but i always knew this was a huge problem problem and want to be free of it. i started eating much more normally 6 weeks ago and slowed way down on the exercise. surprisingly i feel much less anxious and shockingly unfazed about a 1 pound gain. it s like i just got sick of it all, after years and years and kind of quit, just like that. i really wish i had done this sooner. questions: is this some kind of honeymoon and i m just so relieved to be eating but i will at some point panic? my stomach is insanely loud after i eat. for hours. why? why was my heart rate so wonky? that was a huge factor in me seeking recovery. it could be 39 or 18 on any given day. will it even out as i recover? i ve been reading a lot about extreme hunger and feel weird that i don t have it at all. if anything, i m not really hungry unless i start eating. in the thick of my illness i could easily and frequently eat nothing until 5: pm along with 1 mile runs etc. i just kind of ran on this wired energy that is now gone, but it hasn t really been replaced by hunger? should i expect eh to show up? thanks so much for reading ",

"i might be developing bed and i am actually worried. tl;dr: i had anorexia, restricted for 1 year, quasi recovered for 2, then tried all in like actually all in 2 months ago, since then i have had night binges and i am worried for my physical health. i am not going to lie. i made quite a happy post two month back and i still want to keep up that energy. however, currently i am on a thin line between relapsing and binge eating and i want to get out. my restriction isn't even physical anymore. i fantasise about starving myself once i move out, because i hate my body at the moment. i think i allow myself to eat everything yet i constantly think about food. maybe i give up too easily, but i will try to explain why i think i am heading towards bed 1. i do not count calories, i do not excessively exercise and i do not restrict any type of food except for animal products for which an animal had to be killed ex: whey, gelatin and all meat and fish . 2. these binges are only at night, when i am bored and do not know what to do with my time 3. it is always caused by a fuck all moment or tonight by my stomach feeling like a never ending pit. 4. my body genuinely shouldn't gain any more. i wish i could be like yes yes no problem but gaining more weight would cause horrible bone and muscle pain. it would severely restrict my ability to move and i genuinely do not want this. this is caused by a separate health condition. 5. i feel guilty for eating like this and have started doing it secretly and fantasising about going out and buying everything i want and stuffing myself. which is weird because i have a stash of my favourite food at home. 6. i constantly think about food like i am restricting or something. it has been worse i admit and i am distracted more easily but i cannot distract myself from binging. the meal planning never stops inside my head. i always look at food despite hating cooking and baking. 7. i will eat until i am sick, until my stomach acid is burning, my body is shaking and i can feel my heart pounding am i weak? is my will too weak? am i doing something wrong? will i get out of this ed hell? i always thought an was bad but this shame might be worse. my mum tells me i am making this up and i still restrict and i honestly do not know any more. i know of extreme hunger and i genuinely believe i had it at the start but currently it feels unnecessary. please do not tell me to just continue eating unhealthy quantities, as i have explained my quality of life will severely decrease with more weight gain. i just want food to be normal, not a mental guilt ridden battle",
"how to deal with going into residential at a ""healthy"" weight?. yes, i know ""healthy"" is a relative term and the weight i'm at is technically not healthy for my body but unfortunately society and sometimes professionals just don't view things these ways anyway, recently i have relapsed with anorexia. the last time i went to treatment i was considered clinically underweight and did the mandatory weight restoration there. during this process i had to be transferred to another facility and at that point my weight was very much at a clinically ""healthy"" weight but i was still at the weight restoration process because my dietitian at the first clinic believed in health at every size and the dietitian who took on my care at the new center decided to just go along with the previous dietitian. just because i was beyond anxious about stopping the process and trusted the first dietitian a lot even though i knew i was about to be put at a weight i was going to be very uncomfortable at. however this new place was not so kind, i also had the mentality of following my extreme hunger which my first treatment center also encouraged so i asked to eat anytime i was hungry. when i did this at the new center the staff accused me of binge eating and often refused to ask the dietitians if i could have more food or would shame me if i asked for more food saying things like ""well you just ate."" but then i would see girls who were uw and if they asked for food they never had any troubles. so yeah, after that experience, i am very very scared to go to residential at my current weight. and of course my ed is screaming at me telling me that i don't need it because of x y and z. does anyone have any tips to get over this anxiety? to help deal with this internalized message my ed is telling me that i have to look a certain way to go to residential? i am almost ready to just back out, so i can get worse but i know i can't do that.",
"anxiety spike when letting go of behaviors. hey there. more recently in the past month i've been genuinely trying to kick my eating disorders ass and have it not be apart of me. i am trying to eat whatever i want no matter the calories and effects that it will change my body. since i've started this my anxiety has seemingly sky rocketed, even causing me to quit my full time job due to the anxiety i have been feeling. i'm pretty sure this anxiety is coming from the ""lack of control"" feelings my brain is having now that i'm letting my body and food rules go. everyday has been me dealing with anxiety to some degree and having a lot of days where i'm pretty much paralyzed and take naps to stop the uncomfortable feelings. i cant focus often and constantly feel nervous. i moved back into my parents since i feel like i cant work and make money due to my anxiety. its making me feel sad a lot of the days or sometimes hopeless that i wont be able to function and live life. has anyone else experienced this when recovering? were you still able to be successful with recovery and taking your life back? did the anxiety stop or reduce? some context: i'm 19yos m and am in community college it's been summer these past months though i have been having a super hard time trying to find hobbies or do old hobbies. it's been extremely difficult to get myself to do anything or find anything that brings me joy. i'm not on any medication i'm trying to enlist into the airforce so it's not an option right now . i typically do therapy once a week on zoom. i've been in ed treatment for over two years. i have dealt with disordered eating from a young age since puberty essentially and the behaviors only got worse till it became a full blown eating disorder at age 15. i developed a severe binge purge type bulimia when i turned 17 and still have b p episodes maybe 2 3 times a month these days after intense treatment. i am fully committed to recovery and beating the eating disorder.",
"hitting recovery minimum vs. binge urge. i would like to hear your opinion, if it s better not to react to reactive binge urges, that are not initiated by hunger, despite generally being under an appropriate calorie minimum for recovery in that day? hear me out, before you say that it is mental or extreme hunger. i do have my fair struggle with those as well and i think hence the question that it s not the case this time. but eds can be sneaky, so i just hope for a second opinion. my question comes from occasions that i encountered the last days. because it is summer where i live i stayed out longer than i usually do, which in return led to having dinner way later than i am used to have. i sadly still struggle with time windows and rules around time somewhat. but i still forced myself to eat something. yay i guess. however after finishing my later meals, my ed keeps screaming at me to now screw it gotta love the fuck it mindset , because i already failed and go buy things to binge on. i was not actually hungry or did really wanting to eat anything. it would have been just for a habit i picked up during ed times. i am trying not to trigger anyone with behaviours and thoughts. so i tried practising neural rewiring and not react on the thought and fight the urge. so far so good. the only edge to the whole thing why i am not sure if i am doing the right thing is that at that point i definitely did not hit calorie minimum for the day. which i definitely would, if i allowed myself that binge. but again. in those moments it did not really feel like the times when i actually have mental hunger or hunger at all. what do you think? should i give in to the binge urge just to hit minimums or keep trying to fight the urges?",
"confused about extreme hunger. hello hello it's my first time writting here, and tbh i've created my reddit account just for this sub, bc i really need some advices opinions, and it feels safe here btw i'm french so sorry for the mistakes vocabulary ok so most of my life, i've been fat, when i was small i was chubby and then after eleven years old i became overweight. i discovered with my recent diagnosis for anorexia that i had binge eating disorder without knowing what that was. at the age of sixteen i was obese according to my bmi. because of lockdown, i stopped eating in between the meals and hadn't free access to food, and lost a bit of weight. but in may 2 21 i still wasn't happy with my weight and started to dieting . i lost a lot of weight way too fastly but bc i was overweight, no one was worrying, they even encouraged me to lose more, always more. by december 2 21, it was very hard mentally to have more than one meal, and i was restricting as much as i could. by january i went to a dietetician and a psychologist. it was hard at start and i kept losing weight until april 2 22, at this time i was really underweight, weak, tired, cold. i was so scared to eating normally bc even when i was having correct big meal, i still felt unsatisfied, i felt like i couldn't control myself around food, i always wanted more. and guess what... that's exactly what happened lmao, i totally lost the control the first time i allowed myself to. the first times extreme hunger kicked in it was the messiest thing ever, i was eating as much as i could, during and between the meal. i was eating chocolate, sandwiches, cakes... i gained a lot of weight. like really. after two month in, i'm at a normal weight, i even look a bit overweight which is not a problem, even if diet culture try to make us believe the opposite i couldn't say my weight bc i don't weight myself anymore, and i'm not sure if i can mention numbers here, but i've nerver seen someone talking about a weight gain as important as mine. with my clothes, i can approximatively guess my weight which seems ""healthy"" but... extreme hunger still here. every day. before, it was mental physical, i had a constant burning sensation in my throat, and couldn't handle the idea to stay more than 3hours without eat, even when i was physically full. but now... i just never fell full. i honestly have no clue about when to stop eating bc it feels like the food doesn't arrive in my stomach except at some point . i am not hungry for real, just never satisfied or full. always want more. my dietetician told me it was binge eating disorder, and he could be right but has also never heard about extreme hunger. he thinks i should eat more normally now, and warned me about the risk that i'll make my stomach go bigger. the thing is that i had binge eating disorder before. i have restricted for less than one year and i am back to a normal weight. i believed it was extreme hunger, but it seems a bit too much to be this for real. btw i'm eating way more than when i was having bed what do you think ? does someone have a similar story ? and can anyone tell me about the weight gain in eh ? like does it slow down ? ty for reading and for your help, sending love ",

"dieting vs. disordered eating vs eating disorder help? 17f . tw. hi, i feel like i m really struggling with food, body and exercise, but i don t know if it s enough to need professional help. i know you don t need to be underweight to have an eating disorder but i m not sure if i m unwell enough to seek help or if it s just disordered eating or yo yo dieting. it feels like everyone has a shitty relationship with food, especially teenage girls so i don t know if my behaviours are somewhat commonplace. about 6 months ago i mentioned to my mum about going to the gp but she said that i was yo yo dieting and i should get off of social media. i know you guys can t diagnose but i need help to see if i should book an appointment with the gp. i ve been dieting since i was 13 and am now 17. during this time, i have been either in stretches of calorie restrictions or stretches of binge eating. in my stretches of restrictions, i have no energy, am irritable, food obsessed and don t have my period. i ve probably had about 12 actual periods in my whole life. i calorie count and have to hit my protein goal as well or i feel like a failure. i have lots of memories of hating holidays because i had no energy to take part in activities because i hadn t eaten. i get so hungry during these periods that normal portions of food don t come close to satisfying me. i have to cook for myself as i m scared people will add oils and butter. when i went camping with my family, i cooked all my own food and only ate chicken, rice and salad. however, i do feel confident in my body enough so that my family call me vein for looking in mirrors all the time. i don t eat any processed foods apart from protein powder and spend hours on nutrition subrdeddits. i spend nearly all my time thinking of food, writing shopping lists, reading bodybuilding forums, looking at recipes, watching wieiad and trying to find different macro breakdowns and methods to suppress hunger. i had to quit my part time job as i was getting light headed and weak but couldn t rest. eventually, i reach a breaking point in my restriction and i start binge eating. i don t eat highly palatable foods either just huge quantities of fruit, greek yoghurt, oats, etc but still don t feel full. about every 2 months ill make myself sick from eating so much. when i m binging, my energy levels are so much better but my obsessive food thoughts are still there. if it s a long stretch of binging, i ll regain my period. my self esteem becomes awful though and hate seeing myself in the mirror. in terms of exercise, i have minimum step count of 12k and i weight lift 3 4 times a week. a couple of years ago i used to be way worse with exercise crossfit, running 1 ks and minimum 15k step count . i went to the gp during this time as i hadn t had my period in over a year so they told me to stop running which i did. i feel so trapped by food and my body and there is little space in my head for anything else. i went to the beach yesterday with my friends and we had dirty chips but all i can think about is how guilty i feel for eating them. i would never normally allow myself to eat junk food but there was no other options and it would upset my friends if i didn t eat. i normally don t go out to eat with friends for this reason unless there are calories on the menus. i despise eating in front of other people and it makes me feel incredibly anxious. i have no idea how to eat normally and am constantly terrified of weight gain but binging is causing me to gain weight anyway. i don t see a way out of these cycles. i feel so lost. i have looked into intuitive eating but have no trust in my hunger cues. i think i d just end up binging until i hated my body enough to lose weight again. if i book a gp appointment, i won t be seen for over a month anyway and the cams waiting list is huge. i know so many people have trauma and other far more serious issues so i won t be seen for a very long time. i m worried that i m making it more serious than it actually is and that by focusing on my eating issues makes them spiral. i thought about getting a part time job again to see if i could go private but they require that i m seen by a gp before as i m under 18. any advice would be so so great. i really need somebody to help me out : ",

"i feel like i made a mistake... ive posted on here before about like moving away for the summer to work. i moved down here about 2 or 3 weeks ago. i really wanted things to be good, but i kind of don't really like my job, and eating isn't going too well. i won't get into specifics, but its going pretty terribly and im finding it extremely difficult to hold myself accountable to eat. ive only been really relapsing for like a week, and i know if i keep it going that ill just end up right back where i was 6 months ago. i don't know what to do. i don't want to move back home, and i don't want to go back to treatment. im not really underweight anymore, so i low key feel like i don't even really need to go back i know that isn't true but my brain is telling me it is and its so hard not to listen . but ive never felt worse. even if i wanted to, ive committed to working this summer and i can't just leave. my dietician, my doctor, my parents all think im doing better. i know i should be honest with them, but i can't me. i guess its really easy for them to think im okay since im no longer underweight.. i hate that it ended up like this. i hate that im so aware of the fact that im self sabotaging. i hate that im not better, and i hate that everyone around me thinks im doing so amazing.",
"bought snacks at the airport. this is a huge win for me i used to never eat on flight days. my ed though that i was too sedentary and didn t deserve food. well..opposite actions i have two flights today, one in thirty minutes and one right after that with a layover i m gonna eat the snacks i bought, relax, watch movies amp; read my book lt;3 maybe i ll even try out some of the food on the plane since i ve heard that turkish airlines have some pretty decent options. now i m off, bye ",
"how do i stop counting calories?. i've been counting calories most days for almost a year now. i am recovering and on the days im not dealing with extreme hunger i am counting calories and weighing things and have a strict rule of not going above maintenance i am weight restored . i want to stop, its overwhelming. but i am scared. i get really anxious when think of it because due to my past incredibly heavy restriction its really hard to tell when i am hungry or full. what should i do? thank you",
i need to start today. do today at my therapy session the tenth in total although minus the probatory sessions it s the fifth or so my therapist said i need to start increasing my intake now and basically that she s done just talking about what it will be like and that it s not going to get easier and that i can t keep waiting until i feel like it. we then settled on doing a gt; 2 calorie lt; increase per week so in five weeks i will have reached the gt; 23 24 lt; goal i know recovery minimums are higher but she doesn t know anything about calories she is so clueless which i envy and also she s not a nutritionist so i don t expect her to be an expert . and i need to start today. and right now i m trying to process that. because i don t want to fail our new plan but also don t want to fail my ed and i haven t eaten that much on a regular basis even during the time i thought i was recovered i usually didn t let myself go above the arbitrary gt; 2 lt; guidelines tip listen to the maintenance phase podcast episodes about calories to debunk that . sorry none of this is original and i don t know if i can do the plan yet or if i even want to try. i just ordered an iced chai latte thinking it was cold tea with some milk but it s this huuuge glass of milk mixed with powder which tastes great but i m trying not to lose it. or shit my self haha. oh well.,
mfp shouldn't have a streak... this is literally the dumbest reason i'm finding it hard to stop counting calories but god damn does some monkey part in my brain love watching the consecutive days logged go up even if i know deep down it's not a good thing ,

"i feel like i will never look sick enough. this is long, sorry. amp; sorry if this breaks the rules. i don t post on reddit. i m honestly only posting this bc i keep waking up from being too hungry. if it breaks the rules pls just delete it but don t ban me ? ty : my body refuses to look sick enough in the right ways for people to think i really have an eating disorder. my eyes have dark circles, my cheeks are sunken, my salivary glands are swollen, and my knuckles are scarred. but the rest of my body? nope. i turned 3 last week. my ed started when i was like 12. i kind of think that bc of that my body still holds weight like it did before puberty. when i was 15 a boy told me i had double boobs when we were making out bc i had some fat on my ribcage. when i was 2 i was working out with a friend amp; he told me i gain weight like a dude bc i mostly gain weight in my abdomen, but not in my legs. one of my friends recently tweeted ab how she hates that people tell her they re jealous of her body, but they don t know she has an eating disorder. i ve kind of always told myself she didn t, bc she knows i have one and never brought hers up, and i wanted to tell myself her body was just naturally perfect. bc if she did have an eating disorder, then mine wasn t bad enough. i m jealous of her body, even more now knowing she has an ed. another one of my friends recovered from anorexia. she was sick for around 6 years, visibly sick for around 3. im on year 18. my eating disorder could fucking vote. it could buy a gun. it could sign a lease, check itself out of a psych hold. it s an adult. it s not visibly sick though. i hit puberty and grew breasts. i got my period, and i get it sometimes. my hips got wide to carry children that i don t want because they ll make me gain weight. i have a thigh gap as long as i stay thin enough, because i still gain weight like a dude. my legs will stay small and my hips keep them far apart. the irony isn t lost on me. for years i ve been told by doctors that the only reason i haven t had a seizure is because i take lamictal an antiepileptic to manage bipolar disorder. earlier this year, for the first time i willingly tried to get inpatient treatment. i spent months trying, but it s not an option with medicaid where i live. i m way too much of a risk to authorize a single case agreement for iop or php. i ve passed out and hit my head, the er visit would get covered if i hit it hard enough for that. but not inpatient. living with an eating disorder is such a fucking joke. dying with one is the reality. the world doesn t take it seriously unless you look sick enough for concern. tldr i wish i looked sick enough, i wish i wasn t sick, i wish i hadn t wasted so much of my life on this.",

how bad is it to eat the same thing each day?. the last 4 days i have eaten basically the exact same thing for each meal and snacks apart from dinner bc my mum cooks it i didn t think this was an issue except i keep seeing tiktoks that are about red flags in ed recovery accounts and one of them is all ways something about eating the same thing everyday. can someone elaborate a little on this? i didn t think it was bad,
what do i eat?. i ve stopped calorie counting recently but today i ve noticed i ve got some extreme anxiety around not counting calories. wtf do i eat?,
"i can't tell if i have an ed or not.... to start i know this isn't a healthy mindset exactly but i'm trying to puzzle out whether i should pay a therapist or someone for help, i can't really afford to unless i really need it and it's hard from online resources to figure out if this needs handling or not. i definitely had eating issues as a teen, i'm a trans man and when i was younger i was trying for ""force"" myself into femininity, and that included weight loss. i calorie counted and ate probably around 11 calories a day and worked out on an exercise bike almost every night. i think most of my lunches at school consisted of water and cucumber salads. i've been 5'6"" since i was like 14, and i weighed around 115lbs at the height of this obsession at 17 years old. in college i sort of reversed that, snacking a ton and gaining a bunch of weight. i was around 16 for a couple years. i started calorie counting again because i ""felt fat"" and didn't like how i looked in pictures even though it wasn't really ""fat"" by conventional standards. i've tried to balance since then. i try not to eat too much at meals or overindulge in snacks, without restricting to only vegetables or anything. but recently i can tell i've gained weight and i think i'm spiraling. i keep comparing my body to my cis male partner, because though he is much taller, he does not have the same ""shape"" if that makes sense, i feel rounder than him and it bothers me from a weight perspective and a gender perspective of trying to pass as male without big hips or thighs. i work a fairly active job, its around 2 25 hours a week of working at a pet daycare where i am constantly walking, cleaning, handling dogs, etc, and never sitting down. i eat a little more on work days cuz, well, i'm hungry, but now i'm wondering if i'm indulging too much because ""oh well i've been working all day so its fine."" everything online about eds is either mostly focused on young women girls, or about specific disorders like anorexia or bulimia that i am sure i don't have. and i hate trying to get health advice about eating because it focuses so much on cisgender men or women and i can't tell what advice is helpful for me, a trans man. should i eat less because i'm afab? should it be more because i've been on testosterone for a few years and my hormones aren't the same now? i can't tell. lately i feel like i should lose the weight i've gained and my automatic idea for this is to go back to 12 calories a day like i used to do as a teen. i know thats not a good amount, but when i estimate that i've eaten much more than that in a day, i feel like i'm eating too much. anyone with objective insight who could throw their thoughts in would be appreciated.",
"new to recovery and lots of questions . hi, so i'm very new to recovery and it feels surreal but it seems like the only way to go about this really is to eat lots more and not compensate for it . everything feels super overwhelming and i'm having a hard time believing this but i'm really committed and have a few questions. what has been the worst part for you and when is the worst over? is there any way to get this over with faster? how do you know if you're doing the right thing? when did things start to go uphill? is this really going to fix the obsessive thoughts about food? i'm just dreaming about the day i won't be thinking about my next meal or visualizing food 24 7 and sort of get a life back. lastly, do you think it's a good idea to join a community such as this one? i'm just worried it might be triggering or that it would keep me even more obsessed with all of the strange things happening to me. sorry for all the questions, it's just so precious to hear from others who went through something similar and any comment is appreciated from the bottom of my heart. thank you and have a blessed day ",

"i think i can finally say i ve recovered. tldr: after over 5 years of eds i ve finally gotten to a point where i can say i ve recovered. it s been so freeing and i ve regained things like hunger cues that i thought i would never gain back again. recovering is genuinely so worth it and has taken such a weight off my shoulders. if you d like to ask anything or would like advice please feel free :d ive dealt with multiple mental illnesses disorders in the past and still do but the one that affected me the most was definitely my eds. i mainly dealt with binging and restricting for around 5 years along with pretty bad body dysmorphia that i m still working through to this day. i thought i d never get better and didn t want to get better for the longest time but since i took the steps to just go all in and finally give my body everything it needed i have so much less anxiety and feel so much more free. it s been around 2 years since i started fully recovering and i m finally at a place where my body and mind feel healthy. i actually have my hunger and fullness cues again which i thought i d never get back and can open packages without feeling the need to finish it all in one go. the times where i do eat too much, i rarely feel guilty about it and i just sleep it off. not only that but i thought i d gain a bunch of weight in recovery which was true initially as i went all in but after about a year and a half in i stepped on the scale and i m pretty much back to my normal weight that i was at when i was binging and restricting except now i m not going through mental hell worrying about food and calories. some things have still stuck with me like the occasional thoughts of how it would be nice to be skinny again for certain events but since i changed my mindset from wanting to look small to wanting to look strong and healthy i find that my life has genuinely become so much less stressful. i find i m still really easily upset and sensitive to anything regarding dieting, eds or calories and have a lot of paranoia that people around me are lying and trying to hide their own eds but i m slowly working on that and have many years of self improvement to go.",

"i can't stop eating and i'm scared. i have felt especially out of control around food for almost a month now, but the last two weeks have been particularly bad. i went on a weekend trip in which my eating schedule was different from normal i.e eating in restaurants and having more sweets and i haven t seemed to be able to get back to my regular routine. i wake up every day with an idea of what i will eat and how much; however, by mid afternoon or early evening, i find myself feeling hungry almost all of the time and totally blow past what i had planned and eat much more. as an example, here is what i ate throughout the day today censored with spoilers for obvious reasons : amp; x2 b; gt; 3 tbsp of peanut butter lt; gt; 1 4 cup of blueberries lt; gt; 1 2 of a pumpkin loaf slice from starbucks lt; gt; a lot of watermelon i didn t measure it but at least four cups for sure lt; gt; 1 hard boiled egg lt; gt; almost 2 full fudge frosted brownies from the grocery store, 18 calories each lt; gt; 2 and a half cups of plain pasta lt; most of the carbohydrates came later in the day which is typical for me. i am always able to stop eating once i reach fullness but i always feel so much shame especially when i find myself eating this much by 3 pm or so and the hunger keeps coming back again and again. i don't think that it's extreme hunger because i'm over a year into an recovery. my stomach and face bloat so much that i almost look like a different person. all of this eating is beginning to reflect on the scale, too, and my exercise isn t changing anything. i am about two pounds heavier than i was at the beginning of june and the number just seems like it will continue to go up which is so upsetting to me because i am not in a place where i need or want to gain weight. on the contrary, i should probably lose a small bit of weight as i feel very uncomfortable in my body right now. my family and friends tell me that they can t tell that i m gaining weight and that i m not overeating, but 1 i can see how different i look now and 2 i really do think that i m eating too much and may even have bed now based on the sheer amounts of food i am eating every day. my therapist has stated that i do not have bed since i am eating in response to hunger rather than emotions i rarely if ever comfort eat and am aware of my fullness, but it is hard for me to believe. i know that i was very sick, but i honestly miss when i had the ability to control my hunger. right now i am in such an embarrassing rut that just keeps making me cry out of disgust and shame.

"seeking advice guidance. hi, i think i have an eating disorder disordered eating and started seeing a dietitian just last week. i wanted to reach out to this community and hopefully to people who had a similar experience or overcame their disordered eating, i would really appreciate any guidance : my dietitian recommended eating every few hours, and what ended up happening is that every time i start eating i get into this ""mode"" where i never feel satisfied. i've had this really strong mental urge to eat really, really large amounts of food over the past week especially at night even though i feel very full physically. and so i ended up eating all of this food and responding to my cravings because i felt so tired and sad of denying myself food and i thought i would try things differently for once. but i feel very afraid, i didn't want to give in to the anxiety and post about it but i would really want to know if this is normal and if i messed up and set myself back. i stopped counting calories because i think it would just make me even more anxious, but i would say it must have been around 3 calories or so a day, more or less. what makes me feel the most worried is that i don't feel well physically, i am tired and full and haven't been sleeping well. it's like i'm very hungover even though i didn't drink and like i've been doing something very wrong. should i stop responding to the cravings and urge to eat so much and be more reasonable even though it feels very difficult in the moment ? or is this normal and should i listen to what my brain is saying? would you have any advice? i really, really want to get better and would love to hear from you guys. i've felt alone for so long going through this and am opening up about it for the first time recently, and i really hope to pass it forward and help others out in the future as well once i am able to do so. thank you for even just reading this and i wish you all the best, whoever you may be.",

"is it possible to get recovery symptoms with a small relapse? tw . i had a pretty severe ed with restriction from the ages of 17 22 and was very low weight and unwell at the time. i recovered and experienced extreme hunger, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue etc. and was pretty much good until the age of 25 when i relapsed in november 2 2 tw numbers so since relapsing about a year and a half ago, i really have been only like 5 1 lbs underweight, but noticeably so to other in my life and had people point out i looked unhealthy. i also experienced mood and hormonal problems. now that i ve been dedicating myself to weight gain again the last two months, i ve gained about 5lbs and eat very consistently, i ve been so incredibly exhausted and think about food constantly. i think what i m asking is a small relapse like this able to produce the effects and symptoms i m now experiencing? the brain fog and fatigue makes me wonder if another health issue is happening or if this is related to my restriction over the last 1.5 years? any personal experiences would help me, i have a therapist and psych but they don t seem to offer much insight on what to physically expect. thank you so much",

"help please question about refeeding disorder hypermetabolic syndrome. i am recovering from significant weight loss and am about 3 months into the process of upping calories. i was wondering how you can tell if you re at risk for refeeding syndrome still versus just hypermetabolism. i don t know how long the risk of refeeding syndrome is present for. i know i m in hypermetabolic because i m going through over 1 grams of potassium a day and my magnesium needs are high..they always were though and i was deficient for awhile. i m experiencing spasms and some glucose drops but not consistent. i thought i was at the point where i can increase calories a little more liberally now and i m not gaining weight still at 25 calories. i m just afraid of inducing refeeding syndrome. i ve also been restricting carbohydrates to 3 grams a day because i heard to keep them restricted. i don t know if this applies anymore at this stage. i also am eating low fat because gallstones were found but they are tiny so i was told they wouldn t block the duct if they pass through..but i imagine if enough passed through at once..who knows. i can t find consistent information about how to eat when you have small gallstones. any advice about any of this would be greatly appreciated. i m not sure what i should be doing at this stage and resources seem slim. no doctor in my area seems to know much about any of this and all they ve told me is that if serum phosphorus checks out, that s the only thing that matters..that does not seem accurate.",
"i can t believe what i just did. i can t believe i did what i did. i just 1 rested. i ate hours and hours earlier than usual. i didn t go out and walk for hours heck, i didn t even do anything productive. i just browsed my phone and ate a ton of food. i can t believe it. i ate everything i usually would plus gnocchi soup, a homemade brownie i made, and apple and peanut butter, and now i m eating a huge bowl of oatmeal that i drenched in maple syrup and peanut butter and topped with granola. i feel really scared but also really proud and even relieved? maybe i can do this again. the amount of anxiety is so much less when i m not pushing my body to its absolute max.",
"i am so scared but it is time. this may be a long one but i am so scared. i have been in recovery for 2 months now and have made some progress. from walking and exercising beyond excessively i will not share the number in this post, but it is in a previous one , to no exercise and a moderate amount of walking. i have also been eating 3 and challenged fear foods i am super proud of myself for that. however, i am so hungry. i am not myself, i am so depressed and all i think about is food. which somehow has made me restrict. i had also been saving up calories for a birthday party for alcohol i know dumb lol . today i am going to honor it, and i know i am around 1 , behind on my weekly target goal by my nutritionist. so i am basically going to try to eat that today and eat whatever i want. for me is one of the biggest struggles that i also have borderline orthorexia and need everything to be healthy and high protein. today am i not going to care. i am going to try, but i am also scared out of my mind",
what makes recovery worth it for you?. i m posting so i can come back and remind myself whenever i want to relapse. here are some things that make recovery worth it to me; healthy hair being able to sit on hard surfaces without pain not being ravenous all the time more stable mood full cheeks soft hydrated skin consistent bathroom habits stronger eyesight enjoying food . . . edit: you guys the response to this post has been wonderfully overwhelming i m so grateful to all of you for further inspiring me to recover i wish each and every one of you the very best wherever you are in your journey ,
"the disordered part of me is fighting back again and is being annoying. i have had a really good large food intake for a few weeks now, but not really enough to have gained more than around gt; 1kg lt;, which all things considered isn't anything. but especially after this weekend, honoring much of my mental hunger, my brain is telling me ""the fun is over, you can't continue like this"". it's just such a struggle to fight it. no mental approach seems to work; my ed tells me ""eating less again will stop weight gain, it will not cause your cholesterol and bloodsugar to be of any concern, you don't restrict enough to actually harm your body in the long run, and if you restrict now you don't have to worry about restricting in the future when you have diabetes society calls you overweight your cholesterol is too high"" etc. do i want to recover? do i want to think about food less? i think so? but i am starting to doubt it...i can't seem to convince myself that ""taking my life back from the ed"" is something i really want, as i barely had a life before it. it seems in my head better to just keep my weight low and eliminate potential health risks such as diabetes stroke for some reason low energy, osteoporosis, lower heart rate etc. don't worry me . to combat this thinking i again free poured my granola; and my ed again said ""too much granola, too much milk, too big banana; did you also eat watermelon? don't do that""... and then i ate a measly low cal lunch and my dinner is also going to be too few calories, but i just can't seem to help it today. eds are so annoying when i sometimes want it gone, and other times i don't.",
"trouble sleeping with extreme hunger. i keep waking up in the middle of the night wanting to eat. eating enough during the day isn t an issue as i listen to my hunger signals, eat calorie dense foods, etc and i always eat right before i go to sleep bc i can t sleep unsatisfied. for example today i ate a lot before i fell asleep like i even felt a little uncomfortable which is rare for me now , but i woke up about 2 hours later feeling like i hadn t eaten anything and food was literally popping up in my dreams prior to waking up. i m pretty sure i m hypermetabolic rn bc i m not gaining fat rapidly like i was at the beginning of recovery and i can eat insane amounts of food and literally feel nothing. i m honestly tired of this. my mental hunger was just beginning to calm down then this happens. i m taking so much melatonin but my body still will not let me sleep. it s messing with my schedule and i ve been waking up in the afternoon because of this. my body looks so weird bc of the water retention, i thought i was at my pre ed size thanks to my obsession with the scale during a lapse, but i think a lot of it is water, i can tell i haven t gained enough fat to be at my set point just by how i feel if that makes sense. i just want to gain the fat and have it be over with and have normal hunger satiety cues and a normal looking body. my friend invited me to the beach on wednesday and i literally can t go bc my stomach is constantly distended. it s not a fatphobia thing, i had a lot more fat on me at my highest weight and i didn t feel uncomfortable wearing a bikini bc my body looked normal. i look thin when i have on like a t shirt and shorts but if i wear anything that reveals my stomach my body just looks so weird like kinda thin but also chubby at the same time but in the weirdest way possible and it makes me want to cry. it has been like this since the day i increased my intake i started out at 3 4k so not even that crazy and my stomach has not looked normal since then. even when i had small lapses the water weight still stuck around. i just want to know when it gets better",
"got myself the sushi i wanted lt;3. i remember going to the sushi bar with my friends when i was actively restricting and instead of my favorite rolls i d always get the tiniest ones filled with nothing but cucumber,, like four pieces as well since they were low calorie . meanwhile my friends enjoyed themselves, ordered what they wanted and didnt even think abt the food or calories. i was sitting there jealous of their food with my stomach rumbling who wouldve guessed that those four pieces didnt fill me up and not engaging in any conversation. right now i ordered myself a pretty big portion of delicious rolls despite having raging body image issues today.. and enjoyed them all when my ed starts messing with me, i fight back and dont give in i m sorry for being cringe lmao ",
i m sad. i was looking through my vids and came across videos of me in my ed and i very much am in shock at how fucking sick i looked. i felt a pit in my stomach when i saw those photos vids of myself because how big i felt during that time period and in actuality i was so small i m so sad for myself like genuinely crying at what i did to myself and feel sorry for that girl. i m sorry if this is random i m just ranting ,
"why should i even care about addressing my ed when it hasn t put me in danger except close to one time. my labs are never too concerning, i ve never been given a feeding tube, only threatened one, i ve never been super frail underweight, my organs are fine, my teeth are the only negative effect my ed has given me. all of this just makes me feel like such a weak failure. i ve only ever been in the depths of actual worry near death was last year.. and i miss it so damn bad",

"i overshot due to medication. thought my insatiable hunger and anxiety was 1 due to recovery and i ve been trying to just ride it out the past few months. i couldn t figure out why i was gaining weight at such an alarming rate like gt; 7 lbs in less than 5 months lt; was just hoping for it to taper idk. anyways i started doing some research and read about non disordered people who were on the anti acid medication i ve been on the past 3 months, who have experienced confusing weight gain and insatiable hunger. i stopped taking it 2 days ago and i swear to you my hunger has been cut in half? like hurray i figured it out but it makes me feel like i overshot this much for nothing, i was trying to listen to my body but it was just the medication. plus i still don t have my period. anyways sorry just wanted to rant. i hate meds they have never done anything positive for me ever : edit: adding that i definitely did experience extreme hunger, not saying that i didn t but i don t think i needed to gain this much",
"no extreme hunger. i ve never experienced extreme hunger in recovery and it makes me feel like there is something wrong with my body. i would love to be able to just eat and eat but i ve never had those feelings. i m currently trying to get out of a relapse right now but have been in treatment for longer periods of time and doing well in recovery before, but again, never had extreme hunger or super strong appetite cues. is there something i m missing or something messed up with my body?",

"overshoot might never taper down, and y all are gonna have to accept that. i ve been seeing a lot of posts over the past week or so regarding overshoot and worrying that it will never taper down. truth is? it might not. and you have to accept that. the product of overshoot weight is to restore fat to fat free mass; fat is always restored first, so to achieve 1 fat free mass the body has to gain more than 1 fat mass, which is what we call overshoot . my issue with this term is that you don t know if it s overshoot weight. bodies change as we age, and you are not going to have the same body you had as a teenager as you do when you are a fully grown, fully mature adult. hell, do you expect your 2 year old body to look the same at 3 ? at 4 ? after having kids? after health conditions you may develop? after various life experiences? eating disorders are a major fucking strain on the body. there are damages to your organs, brain, bones, digestive system, immune system; you have undergone hormone disruption, catabolism, constant cortisol pumping through your body for months or years. because of this, it is very likely you won t end up with the body you had preed because, well, your preed body hadn t yet undergone the damages of starvation. your preed body didn t require this weight the way it does now. it s unrealistic to expect our bodies to stay the same indefinitely; they are meant to change. we see it from birth into old age. recovery can, and often does, take years . your body isn t stupid it knows how much weight it needs to gain, and it will fight you tooth and nail to get there. it doesn t care about some arbitrary bmi scale rooted in psudoscience, all it knows is that it needs more weight than it did before it was starved to function at its best and heal the various damages you ve caused it. you will very likely feel out of breath often, feel fatigued more quickly, feel less flexible; it might be harder to do the things you did before at a lower weight, even a year into weight restoration but again, you have to remember that your body is still doing a fuckton of repairs that you don t outwardly see on the outside. for example: about 24 months into recovery, i was still dealing with all of the above; my legs and feet would swell from walking on them for only a handful of hours, i d be exhausted at the end of the day, my lungs would burn trying to keep up with my partner doing simple things like going for a walk around the city or a basic hiking trail. it didn t matter that i was going these things regularly 28 months in, i no longer experience breathlessness or constant fatigue, my feet no longer swell up, and i can easily keep up with my partner or go for a simple walk. and i haven t lost a single lb of the overshoot weight i gained at least 3 lbs above my preed set point . on top of that you have all new muscle mass that has not been used trained yet you can t expect to feel strong at least as much as you d like without actually training the muscles first. you build it up like you would if you never had an ed, just like anyone else. is fearing it won t taper down understandable? absolutely i am guilty of hoping my overshoot has tapered down as well but it is rooted in disordered thinking. is it really any different than when you were actively engaging in behaviors and hoping your weight would be lower? obviously if you re recovering you aren t actively engaging in behaviors, but the thought process is the same. it doesn t mean there is absolutely, positively zero chance that it won t taper down, but hyperfixating on it is only going to lead to disappointment if it doesn t, or if it doesn t within a specific timeframe. body image is a state of mind, not a state of being. its not dependent on a set number, it s something you actively work on improving. that is to say, you aren t obligated to like your body post recovery it s entirely okay not to like your recovered body. but you do have to learn to accept it which, yes, can be very difficult if you end up at a much higher weight in a fatphobic society that glorifies thinness, weight loss, and dieting at every turn. and i truly empathize with that. it s not easy. here is a series of important questions to ask ourselves: why am i so hyper focused on this weight? how does this weight make me feel? are these emotions and thoughts patterns productive? what are these emotions and thoughts patterns reinforcing about my body and my self worth; are they rooted in fact, or fear? is this possibly a desire to conform to societal beauty standards that are often unrealistic ? if the weight never tapers down, does that affect my commitment to recovery? if yes, then how can i work on that? if not, then is it truly worth hyperfixating over? what can i do to feel good in my recovered body now that is unrelated to my current weight? what has recovery given me that is not tied to to my weight and the physical appearance of my body?",
managing working and eating enough. so basically i d say that on average everyday i m like 1 recovered. only sometimes do i have any kind of disordered thoughts patterns. so just over a month ago i started working full time. now with the work i do the only time i can eat is at lunch. and because i m so busy i don t really feel much hunger due to all the distractions. so on work days i m eating 3 meals with 1 2 serves of fruit and sometimes a random snack when i get home. now on the weekends or on days off i find it hungry wanting a fair bit more food than when i work. my understanding is that on my days off the food intake i have then is what my body wants everyday but i just don t get the chance to do the same everyday. now if this is the case i want to try and incorporate more food into my days when i m at work so my body doesn t feel like i m restricting and go backwards in it s recovery. any ideas for how i can do this? also do you guys think i m on the right track with what it means for this eating pattern? also p.s i m definitely not restricting at all this is just me being aware of how our bodies work and what they need now that i m so far into my recovery.,
parents encouraging me to do light exercise and it s extremely triggering. my dad keeps asking me if i want to go for a bike ride with him and i told him it s extremely activating and the thought of it makes me want to restrict. he said thanks for being honest. i only started recovering in middle of december. curious about ur thoughts. i feel frustrated,
"anyone experience with skinny to strong?. anorexia bulimia smoker here, f35. i used to be obsessed with sports as part of bulimia, but i also felt strong. last 3 years i've quit sports as part of my recovery from gym obsession , and been working from home 2.5 years, smoking at least a pack a day. i'm skinny, so my sick brain wants to keep things the way they are. my diet is poor, as i still want to control it. but i can no longer do any physical activity without being exhausted, and i feel exhausted most of the time. sleeping in weekends for 12 18 hours. it's summer, and i want to do fun stuff, but can't because i have no energy. i've randomly seen inspiring stories of people who recovered, quit smoking and started working out instead. is anyone here who has experienced this miracle and could share? i feel like quitting smoking would be first step, but i'm so exhausted that there is no will power in me. thank you all in advance ",
"coping with rapid weight gain and the question of clothing. okay so due to this community i have come to realize that i actually was not in recovery after my relapse 2 years ago, but rather quasi recovery. i have been giving into my mental hunger the last 5 weeks and, as you can imagine, have been eating a lot. naturally, i am gaining weight rather rapidly, which technically i know is a good thing, a necessity. surprisingly, my issue doesn t lie in the fact that i am gaining weight, but rather with my body changing so, so quickly. i can t keep up. i look in the mirror and just don t recognize the person i see anymore, which is upsetting and confusing my brain a lot, especially since i also don t feel like the person i was anymore, with the active neural rewiring and letting go of my disordered habits. how do you deal with this? when i first was in recovery when i was a teenager i just covered all of my mirrors, but i can say that that was not a good or healthy approach for me. any tips would be welcome. additionally, i m starting to struggle with clothing. i m starting to outgrow all my clothes, however, i don t know how i should proceed from here. i m a student and don t really have a lot of money to spend on clothes even though i already tend to but second hand and since i don t know where this journey is gonna take me and my body, i m worried to buy new clothes only to outgrow them shortly afterwards due to weight gain. do you just buy really stretchy clothes? i also don t want to buy clothes that are way too big because what if i will never fit into them and just bought them for nothing in the end? this is really distressing to be honest. how did do you approach this topic? thank you for reading, any and all comments are greatly appreciated, wishing you the best on your further journey lt;3",
"i can't deal with my thoughts, i need an opinion, advice.... since my girlfriend who was my only support, stopped talking to me i don't have anyone in real life who helps me with my thoughts. she was one of the reasons why i took the decision of starting recovery. i don't wanted to worry her etc. but after one of my bad days she just stopped reading my messages. i was doing my best in recovery. i'm no more cold and so weak. my head don't hurts everyday and i'm just feeling better. unfortunately my mental eh is not gone yet and that makes me feel horrible because i feel that fat everywhere. i recently started lifting weights in the gym after a long break after surgery, and that only made hunger worse. but i can't give up on it, it's my only harmless coping mechanism. i can't deal with feelings and that's the only thought escape that really helps and keeps me clean from sh. i also became more interested in bodybuilding and fit ig accounts. it made me stop honoring all the mental hunger. i started counting calories and macro tracking again. i found myself looking very dull. i feel like i need to make a little cut before my holidays. just 3 weeks in healthy deficit to lose some fat. i'm thinking about go for a lean bulk after that if i would be satisfied with my muscles. but i'm not trusting myself and my disorder. i'm also ashamed of my body. i don't know how i would cope with being just in slips on the beach. my holidays last year was very sad. i was starving myself and i don't remember anything apart from the cold, pain and suicidal thoughts. i wanted this holidays to be different but i also want to be lean like those ig gym bros. yes i know that someday i will have to do this. listen my body and not give up at recovery. what's worse in the coming school year i will write my matura exams. i'm stressed asf because my malnourished brain fog was very strong at this year. i know i should be in my best form for this year. to learn and concentrate, to prepare as best i can. and i know i can't make it while experiencing eh again or starving myslef. but i'm so tired, furious, sad and disgusted of myself now. i want to disappear",
"it s how i feel after . anyone else feel the same way at first? feeling full translates in my head to all the negative things i call myself and i just feel insanely uncomfortable how did y all break out of eating safe foods, challenge something different and not let it ruin your day? how do you enjoy the moment without intrusive thoughts of how much exercise would burn it off??",
question. once i got my hunger cues back in recovery i literally can t stay hungry for long because i get super shaky and and dizzy. anyone else ?,
"through recovery, i've come to realise that my mother triggers my ed behaviours.. tw: self harm, eating disorders. for some background, my mental health problems began at age 1 when my dad went to prison for fraud. my family dynamic immediately shifted into survival mode; my 2 year old brother became the breadwinner and my father figure and my mum began working three jobs to keep the mortgage paid off, my dad also very kindly left many maxxed out credit cards, because he was in jail, they all came after my mum for payment which was hell, all these banks calling the housephone multiple times a day, every day. i became introverted when my dad went to jail, and my nervous anxious picking and scratching at my arms turned into gt; cutting lt; , i managed to hide it until when i was 11, when i reached for something in the supermarket and my mum clocked on when my sleeve slipped. understandably, she was angry, upset and distraught that she hadn't noticed my sh until that point. i got put in therapy and my mum was mega supportive in that she wanted to find a way to help me stop self harming and be around at home more when possible. a concoction of going into an all girls convent school, my dad getting out of prison and hitting puberty lead me to be feel uncomfortable in my body. my self harm became less at points, but i began restricting and purging when i was 13. i went through cycles of this throughout my teens, until i turned strict vegan at 18 and found that it was 1 a huge part of my identity. 2 a way of restricting food groups which people were unable to really challenge or take away from me. my mum has historically been a fad diet lover and complete gym bunny. many of my childhood memories are being taken to the gym playing around whilst my mum worked out 5 days a week. she never directly spoke ill of my appearance, but i was always more of a tomboy that the typical pristine made up essex girl that i think she would of liked me to have been. i met an older guy at 2 , and jetted off travelling for a year and a half. unfortunately, this wasn't great for my mental health, and in order to grasp any type of control over my life, my ed came out full swing. my ed lead to the eventual breakdown of my relationship and me moving back to the uk where i was to recover at my parents home which had it's pros and it's cons . i was diagnosed with atypical anorexia osfed and put into an op treatment programme. i remember having my first ""monitor meeting"" and being given my food schedule to follow at home and was dreading following it at home due to, what i now realise, my mother's disordered views on food eating. for example: eating once a day: my mum will only eat dinner, and drink coffee instead of eating food. labels foods as: good, bad, treats. if a meal is of a substantial size, it's a ""feast"" she would call my meals this when i was actively trying to recover, which would set me back. she's fatphobic actively comments on peoples weight or eating habits, which often made me feel scared to recover as someone with body dysmorphia, i believe i was of a much larger body size than i was at this point . if she eats a takeout or what she feels is ""too much"" will reguarly joke or say that it was enough for a week, ""i've eaten this so i can't eat dinner"" ""it's only light so i can eat "". by some miracle of god, i recovered well whilst in op and entering the pandemic. even to a point where i was able to move out and maintain recovery which felt amazing, even though i struggled with my body image at times. however, moving out, i was able to see so clearly the comments that my mum would make as i was seeing her less. i realised that i would be doing well, on the straight and narrow, and see my parents in which comments would trigger me and make me question my recovery, my body image, everything: at times coming close to relapse because of it. last october, my mh took a dip so i began taking antidepressants. i also chose to start the pill because i was starting training as a nurse i didn't want to fall pregnant before i graduate. although i was nervous about potential weight gain, my studies and very supportive relationship kept me grounded in my recovery. my mum was proud of me for studying, and i really want to achieve well for myself to show myself i can do it. however, i am aware that i feel like i want to reach my mum's expectations, or to feel commended by her. recently, i have felt selfconscious and unformatable around my mum. she has, for some reason, pass comments on my past body; particularly items of clothing she loves me in, clothing from my active disorder. she'll tell me she worries, because she can tell im selfconscious, that i'm not happy in my body, but the thing is, i will feel fine, until i am around her again. i feel like it's a mindgame, a totaly headf ck. because in a time of seeing her, she'll tell me she's proud of the progress i've made, talk sadly of how poorly i was, but then in another conversation compare my ""build, limbs, genetics"" to that of my dad's side who are overweight, obese . it floors me. my mother has low self esteem, she barely eats herself; my mum, has an eating disorder? i think back to how challenging i could be when i was actively in my ed, the way i would talk about myself or even about others at times; it was my ed talking. one thing i know for sure, i need boundaries and to protect myself from relapse. i so wish, my mum could receive help, therapy to find more confidence in herself. if she knew how this has affected me, impacted me, she would be hurt, broken, feel like she's failed as a mother she has mentioned this when talking about how she feels she failed as a mother when i began struggling with my mental health at 1 . it makes me scared to become a mother, this trauma i need to work through. yesterday, my mum made comments again about my weight, my body. i spend the drive home and all of this morning wondering if i was to shrink myself, to go back to my disorder, would she love me? would i be good enough? at present: i am at the best health i have ever been at 26, have a stable relationship, achieving great grades. but because i'm not a size x, i don't feel good enough for my mother, and i wonder if i ever will be. tldr: i am in a constant head f ck with my mother, she says she's proud of me, but clearly misses how my body presented in my active disorder. i think my mum has an eating disorder and i have adopted many of her disordered behaviours in order to feel accepted by her. i am devastated because i feel that i will never meet her expectations unless i shrink my body.",

triggered by my mums constant dieting. attempting recovery by myself atm but it s so fucking hard every time i open the fridge and see her meal replacement shakes and diet sodas which is all shes currently living off. shes well aware of my ed and that im trying to get better but her constantly yo yo dieting is so damaging to me and she wont give it up even though it never ever works bc diets are bullshit . the total cals of the shakes she has are incredibly low and the ed thoughts want me to be competitive amp; eat less than that even tho i know it wont do me any good and im fully aware i need to recover for myself not anyone else but. its so hard : shes seen what months of severe restriction has done to my body amp; my brain i dont know why shes doing this when she s been watching me get sicker and begging me to eat more.,
"triggering nurse?. okay, so in my stupidity i looked around online for resources surrounding mental hunger. i think about food all the time despite being full, even if i eat meals and snacks every day and have done for years, and lately i've been eating more calories than before, so probably gt; 25 calories lt; each day. i don't know how long much i restricted, but considering my weight and height gt; 17 cm and 51kg lt;, it makes sense that i'm thinking about food all the time despite eating properly, at least according to this sub and other people in recovery. cue the trigger warning. some nurse and or nutritionist not sure if clinical or not responded to someone who also had mental hunger despite feeling full from eating all the time. they said something along the lines of ""you've taught your brain to think about food all the time, and should do some sort of activity to get you mind over on to something else. it can be taking a walk, a bike ride, maybe organized sports or other hobbies. no wonder you're hungry all the time, thinking about food would make you hungry "" so this really rubs me the wrong way, and completely invalidates mental hunger, stating it to just be ""habitual"" and ""something you've taught your brain to do"". so... am i just mentally weak? did i just, teach my brain to look up pictures of food after eating a huge dinner? should i go for a f cking walk every time i think about food which would in my case just be an excuse and justification to eat even more ? i want to hear your thoughts on this, because now i'm convinced that i'm not actually mentally hungry, i just happen to have taught my brain to obsess over food. oh, and when i play video games, talk to people, take walks, sit in a lecture taking notes i still think about f cking food and i also have a better memory of what my fellow students brought for lunch than what i actually did during the lecture, but i guess that is just because i taught my brain to think about food all the time, correct?

"nickelodeon tw: calorie counting . since netflix recently added zoey 1 1, a nickelodeon show, to their roster, i revisited it for my childhood nostalgia. like other kids shows, although the humor was cheesy, there was a charm to it. but omg. it s like the writers on this show were trying to instill a fear of food and weight gain into young girls and boys at such an early age. for example, the main character and her friends all thin young teenagers are all staring at one slice of chocolate cake. one of the friends says she feels weak because she got the chocolate cake and tries to pass it off to her friend, who then refuses it because she s trying to be good , and then passes it to the other friend, who also refuses because that slice of chocolate cake has like a billion calories in it . the friends then decide to only take one bite of the cake slice and that s it. they savor it, and then take one more bite. the friends all exchange satisfied, but guilty looks and the scene ends . in another episode, the opening scene starts with the main character saying ugh, bagels have 3 calories in them . along with instances of characters both girls and guys saying that macaroni and cheese is too carb y , calling thousand island salad dressing fattening, slapping candy out of each other s hands, and feeling guilty for eating salad with a bag of chips, it s no wonder i felt influenced to restrict certain foods even at a young age. another nickelodeon show, icarly, shows a teen girl and her guy friend being angry at another girl for drizzling butter on their popcorn, because now it has tons of calories and is super unhealthy. yet another show, victorious, shows guys complimenting a petite character for weighing 9 pounds this was ariana grande s character . the common theme? they all demonized food and showed unhealthy food relationships to generations of impressionable kids. they were all directed by dan schneider too, a recently revealed pedophilic show director . i just feel so creeped out and upset by all the diet culture in media that was aimed for children ",

"realizing how ingrained diet culture is and simultaneously doubting whether i ever had an ed. i went camping this july 4th weekend and i m chinese, so my family and i went with a bunch of chinese family friends. one of my moms friends kept talking abt keto and how she doesn t eat rice. she also said she was encouraging her husband to lose weight, because he was getting a stomach. her husband is literally super skinny. the whole trip her husband kept randomly pacing around the campsite and ate literally massive amounts of lettuce. there was another family on tht trip and i thought they were a bit better, but they also weren t. my moms friend started talking abt one of the little girls behind her and her parents back, saying tht she was chubby and commenting on how she ate too many s mores. literally all the kids on the trip were eating s mores, but she proudly said she restricted this poor little girl after three s mores. the other family s parents agreed and were talking abt how tht little girls mom would have done the same and how dads don t care as much abt controlling weight. i was appalled and shocked. these were literally grown ass adults talking abt a ten year old who isn t even their kid. i brought it up to my mom later, who, bless her heart, is very supportive, but she told me i was overreacting because of my eating disorder and chinese people are just like this . this has thrown me into kinda a relapse because it feels like everyone around me is always hyper aware and judging everyone else s body, and if i get any bigger, i won t deserve food anymore. oh and i m doubting my ed because it feels like everyone s restricting and talking abt weight loss so did i even have an ed or am i j justifying my gluttony now with extreme hunger ",

"will the overshoot weight ever go down? losing hope.. i'm having a very hard time lately. i've always been naturally slim, but after the initial weight gain, i gained the same amount on top of that. i've weight restored a little over a year ago, i'd say april may 2 21, also got my period back around that time. it's not even just about the weight, but i just can't get used to having such a completely different body type. i've had to buy an entire new wardrobe, even tshirts didn't fit me anymore. literally had to give everything away that i wore before, even lose, oversize cut dresses are so tight i can't wear them anymore. it's also difficult because i feel like i'm just too heavy for my body, if that makes sense. i'm getting sweaty and hot extremely fast now, i've actually started sweating a lot, having sweat run down my face even when i'm not being active which never happened before. i'm having a hard time doing yoga because, no matter how hard i try, my arms can't seem to hold up my weight, even in relatively easy asanas. i get out of breath when taking the stairs, and i don't have a lot of energy bloodwork's fine, everything's fine according to my doctor . my anorexia started when i was 2 i'm 25 now , so it's not like i was a teenager. i'd been at the same weight and size for years pre ed. i miss the body i had before my ed, i'm scared that i've ruined my metabolism and the overshoot weight will never go down. how long did it take you to lose the overshoot weight? did you notice anything different about your appetite, your energy levels, anything? did you do anything differently around that time? please give me some reassurance that it actually is possible to lose the overshoot weight. i'm losing hope and i miss the way i used to look pre ed. and on a final note: i'm actually begging you not to tell me that worrying about my weight is disordered. i haven't weighed myself in a year. i've been in therapy for 3 years. i eat enough. i have a balanced diet. i stopped working out excessively, mainly doing yoga these days. i think it's normal that i want my old body shape back, that i want to feel like me again in my body. and i just want to wear my vintage levi's and my old summer dresses again, buying new clothes all the time is getting so expensive and thrifting is not an option where i live.
