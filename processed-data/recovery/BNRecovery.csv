"b p stress dreams. i ve been sober from b p and restrictive behaviors for about two weeks. i ve always been prone to stress dreams usually about things like missing assignments deadlines appointments, accidentally killing all my plants, butchering a presentation, etc. recently, i m sure due to the internal and external pressure and desire to stay in recovery, they ve taken on the form of relapses. when i wake up, i m usually feeling upset and it takes me a while to mentally and emotionally move on from the imagined relapse. it is also decreasing my overall quality of sleep. does anyone have any advice for alleviating these stress dreams? are there any safe methods to reduce dreaming during sleep?",

"edema and gain weight in bulimia recovery when will it become better?. i was bulimic for 1 years, purging 1 times a days almost everyday. i have finally decided to start recovering a month ago, and even thought it s totally worth it, i won t deny it has been difficult. after a week of it, i gained a lot of weight and stated to have severe edema in my bum, legs, face and belly. i m not eating unhealthy at all and i m not restricting, i m not hungry or craving for food as before but i ve gained 2 kg which is mad for such a short time and i seem to be stuck there. my body bloats in different moments during the day and i m hopeful this will get at least a bit better; because my mind feels great but sometimes i get anxious and sad about these changes. has anyone been through the same? thanks",

"hard week tw. i have binged and purged every day this week around 8pm. i m so stressed out about going to college and i don t want to go. i feel stuck every time i go and i just don t feel like my life is going anywhere. i burst into tears when i was scrolling through tiktok and saw a recovery video. it made me realize how fucked up i am. i then ended up leaving my room to go to the bathroom and my mom must have heard me to come over. she always finds a way to make me feel bad and i don t think she realizes it but i ve been trying to be more vocal about it. this time she asked me if i was on my period when she saw i had been crying. i told her that she made me feel like my feelings are invalid by saying that. she ended up saying wow like i was the bad guy. she does this a lot and i just think it s because she doesn t realize how insensitive she is and it just adds on. i feel like if i ever end up hospitalized for any of my problems she will end up giving me some speech about how she has gone through something similar and how she has done it. how i should have stopped sooner and how i am damaging my body like she has told me before. i m just really frustrated because i think my mom doesn t realize how badly she affects me and i try to tell her. i don t know, i m just venting now i guess. all advice welcome.",

"list of reasons to recover lt;3. there may have been a post like this in the past, but i can t seem to find it. i m trying to make a list of reasons to recover physical, mental, emotional and would love more ideas of what your top reasons to recover are. mine are: 1 be able to be closer and spend more genuine time with friends and people i love bulimia isolates and separates me from people i love with the shame and secrecy. i can be hanging out with someone and my mind will be fixated on food and b p after i see them, or will cancel plans altogether. 2 see and like what my face actually looks like without swollen glands cheeks from purging. my face being puffy and swollen is a huge trigger to me, yet i know in order to get it to go down, i need to not purge. 3 get rid of the shakiness, dizziness, heart palpitations, and brain fog caused by bulimia. my focus, concentration, memory and mental clarity has gone downhill so much, as bulimia s got worse over the past year and a half. i feel like my attention span and intelligence is so much lower than it was : i really, really want to be able to focus, engage in topics i used to be interested in, and think more clearly most of the time. there are many many more would love to hear your top reasons that make you really want to recover x",

"struggling to recover from frustrating and embarrassing effects of bulimia on my body years later. i'm 23f a few years into recovery. i'm very fortunate that i am, and i don't take that for granted, but there are still hard days. lately, i've been connecting the dots about more of the ways bulimia damaged my body, and it's been really hard not to spiral and be upset with myself. it's hard to know my teeth are so sensitive and cavity prone now and realize bulimia can't have helped with my thinning enamel, for example. but a few weeks ago, i learned that bulimia can weaken your pelvic floor muscles, and a lot of things made sense in ways that... i'm still upset and frustrated over. there's smaller things, like occasionally peeing a bit if i sneeze or something. there's also the fact that i tend to pee during sex. embarrassing, but true. i often tend to release at least some urine when i have an orgasm. it's frustrating. if i want to get off, i either have to hold myself off from reaching my climax, or risk having a mess to handle. i've been with some men who find it somewhat hot, but ""hot"" in the moment doesn't make the cleanup any more pleasant or less embarrassing. i certainly don't know how to approach it with my current partner. he's very understanding and knows i had an eating disorder, but regardless of how he'd react, i just would struggle with not feeling embarrassed or ashamed, which i know maybe i shouldn't. i felt like this would be a good place to start admitting this, because of the relative anonymity and because i figured people here would understand. i don't want to feel embarrassed or ashamed or blame myself. i intend to look into things like kegel exercises to re strengthen my pelvic floor muscles and see if things get better. if not, well. i suppose i could always see a doctor, though it feels like so much to explain. i just want to be able to enjoy myself and be intimate with my partner without having to worry or feel like i can't let go or relax. if anyone has had similar experiences and has any advice or tips, i'd be very grateful.",

"not sure what to do. hello everyone. it has been a while since i made a post in this subreddit, and recovery for my gf 17 has been going great it has been almost 4 months without a b p and she has been doing very well. however, this past week, for whatever reason, her p rging urges have come back. one night, i dropped her off at her house and after weighing herself, she would have p rged if her mom was not constantly asking her questions through the bathroom door. shortly after that, my parents took us to get ice cream and after asking her multiple times if she had room for it in her calorie restrictions and offering to share whatever she wanted to, she had an urge to p rge. the good part is that i was with her, so i literally had to hold her hands back and stop her from doing anything. this is the moment where i realized that this was still very much in her head regardless of our recovery. tonight was no different than the other experiences shared. we ate our last meal around 6 and at 12 our friends took us to mcdonalds and after eating not even a full container of fries, she ran to the mcdonalds bathroom without telling me or anyone else and started attempting to forcing a purge. if i hadn't have noticed that she was in the bathroom and sent one of our female friends in there, she would have totally p rged. i have told her many times that this is a problem that i want to go through together, and it hurts me to a level that no one will understand when she b p especially that night where i had to forcibly hold her back for around an hour and a half , and she knows that too. is there any recommendations that you guys have for recovery? it seems like she doesn't actually believe that it's a problem because its the 'first time in a while' but i know how relapses work and i know it will go right back to where we started if a relapse happens. she used to text me and ask for help and i would drop everything i was doing often even texting her while driving home, or dropping everything i'm doing to go to her house and spend time with her which seemed to help her a lot in her initial recovery journey. however, i feel like my effect on her and her ed has been cut down significantly to the point where she doesn't even listen to me anymore and i'm starting to feel like i'm not enough. she has expressed that she does not want therapy, but would be okay with it if it means that she recovers this happened in a conversation before the one we had today where she said that it is 'okay' to do what shes doing . maybe even like a bulimia support group where she can talk to other people in a similar situation to her? please help us with whatever you can she can read this post too thanks : ",

"moving to a different country, out of control and feeling on the brink of relapse. i ve been on and off bulimic since i was 15, it got really bad when i entered into university. i m very secretive and ashamed about my eating disorder, i became a recluse and missed out on so many social events and formative experiences because of my ed : . i ve never really been able to talk about it with anyone. often i would overeat and purge multiple times a day. since covid first hit, i moved back in with my parents and took university online for 2 years. because i m so secretive with my eating disorder not wanting anyone to know about my purging and food was out of my control living at home again, i have been completely recovered for the past 2 years. quarantine allowed me to eat only when i was hungry and regain a lot of control around food in general. because i only had access to the heathy food at home, i was not really inclined to binge. i naturally ended up loosing some weight as well, which made me feel neutral about my body which i don t think i ve been able to feel for such a long time. i was also lightly working out for the first time in years. i did have a point where i think i was at risk for developing anorexia as i got a bit addicted to going long periods of time without eating but this didn t stick luckily. a few months ago i moved to a different country for work, changing my lifestyle dramatically. my work is very busy and i have no regularity with when i eat or what i eat, causing a great amount of distress considering the control i had before. i m staying with family friends and they all are overeaters and often encourage me to eat massive portions. i m in asia, so food is put out family style, meaning that instead of a controlled portion, you can just keep eating and eating. i m completely on the verge of a relapse of bulimia i feel like my brain is already relapsed into the ed way of thinking . my stomach shrank a lot during my recovery: i was mostly grazing throughout the day on heathy food rather than having full meals which was really good because i m triggered both by feeling hungry and feeling full. but because of my past with bulimia, even if i m not hungry i am capable of eating huge amounts of food. right now i feel so out of control. i ve already gained weight and i cannot stop thinking about food or my body or dieting 24 7. i did have a lapse where i purged after eating two sandwiches for breakfast about a month ago but i m so scared about further damaging my teeth thank you for this subreddit, reading about health issues really has helped me stay purge free . i don t even enjoy food in the same way anymore; when i bindged before i used to get like a high from food, now it seems i just overeat and binge because it s there. because i m in another country and my busy schedule, i mostly eat alone which is super triggering because i have no idea what amount of food is normal and i m always overthinking it. i also receive a large amount of food as gifts through work i ve resorted to throwing it away because if i take it home i know i will binge on it. basically i want to know if anyone has any advice for me to curb ed brain before i relapse. i m already feeling isolated, depressed, anxious and lonely and part of me wants to relapse to just regain some sense of that control back. i m writing this in the middle of the night, woke up with night sweats from binging last night and wanting desperately to purge : ",

""i'm trying"", ""i won this fight"", ""i'm in control now"", all of it, for a lot of people, will always sound like you're just at the same place. but why would you keep on trying so? i've been through hell and back because of this shit. bulimia was my life for eight years: from eleven to almost twenty. i couldn't make a move without thinking about purging and binding. it didn't matter where and how. sometimes i forced vomit and kept swallowing my own vomit until i found a place where i could actually let it go. it could take one hour, two or even four, i didn't care at all. but when you don't feel like you want to purge anymore, don't force yourself to vomit, when you actually can enjoy a meal with your family or your friendships feel much better and honest, then you feel it worths. ok, you won't just live your life like it never happened. sometimes you'll feel like you maybe eating too much, you won't trust yourself or feel confident to eat something... those things, i mean, they do happen. but it's a part of it. does it suck? yes, a lot. you're through the worst. it's normal, it takes a while, it's a big, enormous fight, but we are making it, everyday, step by step. i felt i should write this small and bad written text , cuz i had a bad experience with a doctor for a thyroid problem i'm having and... well, since last wendnesday five days ago, for those who read this after a while , i've been feeling a big stomach pain. sometimes i bloat, suddenly, for a while now. i'm afraid i have been developing a disease or complication in my digestive system due to bulimia through my whole growing up process. yesterday iaied down, look at the ceiling and asked myself: ""am i facing a shadow of that again?"" feels like i can't take another ride. i'm almost 22 now. i purged since my elevens, stopped as soon as pandemics started it was fast, i know. then, i remembered something: dude, i fought a huge battle, alone. this one, at least if it's a battle to come only time will tell , at the very least, this one, i know i can win. all of you here are warriors. even if you purged, even if after day, months or years it happened again, we are all here, trying, by our own some of us have people on their backs, supporting 'em, off course, but we are doing it, aren't we? so, i mean, even though this whole shit gets tiring at some point, we and i mean as community, family, friends and individual we will thrive sorry for the typos, i really didn't want to keep reviewing the text and it's style, it's just an honest thank you and a message to everyone around here lt;3 ",

"help desperate. i have been struggling with bulimia for about 3 years now, but just this past year it has gotten worse. it started over quarantine as just a precautionary measure that was accompanying my resticive eating and desire to lose weight which worked too well, but resulted in an unsustainable lifestyle. eventually backfiring. my weight has fluctuated alot. but now the b p cycles are getting much more frequent and worse. i am losing money from food delivery apps. i am missing out on hanging with friends. i have put on weight. i have constant sores in my mouth. i am lonely at times. today, i had lunch with my boyfriend and he wanted to continue to hang out after, but my panic after lunch was so overwhelming cause i thought i over ate and wanted to get alone asap i left to just spend the next 4 hours alone b p. there was a moment of sheer panic right before i started and a need to exit my body. i wanted to escape the urge but felt so trapped. i wanted to leave my apartment to go hang out with my friends, but couldn't. i had responsibilities to get done that i ignored. i feel like i can't be a person sometimes, and i'm just a slave to my bulimic mind. are there any tips that i can start now? i am desperate and want my life back.",
"starting to slip over the edge into full blown bulimia. hi all i m posting here mostly because i can t afford therapy at this moment and i m really needing some advice on how i can stop myself from fully going over the edge into serious bulimia. i ve had issues with restrictive eating pointed out to me by a therapist before, but i didn t think it was a problem until my boyfriend told me last night that he was starting to be concerned about my relationship with food. i often don t eat anything all day other than a few cups of coffee, yoghurt or a banana and then binge junk food late at night because i m so hungry and then i feel awful about myself. i started purging semi regularly to relieve some of the discomfort from my binges, but it s started becoming more frequent. i d always thought as the purging as oh i feel nauseous, so i ll make myself vomit to feel better but, when i admitted that to my boyfriend, he got even more concerned and said it may be bulimia. i m honestly really frightened. i ve always had a horrible relationship with food and my body i m the biggest i ve ever been right now i m a size 6 and i m hating how i look , and on more than one occasion i ve complimented someone on their looks and asked how they got to be so skinny, and they ve replied with i have an eating disorder. i ve never thought i d be in that territory but i think i am and i m terrified. i m hoping to go to the free campus counciling center when i start grad school in june. i ve struggled with mental illness all my life, and thankfully my depression is under control now, but i really don t want to go back to the mental hospital or have this seriously affect my health or my degree but i also desperately want to be skinny",

i feel trapped. i want to stop wasting money on food apps i want to stop throwing up in cups i am so ashamed and feel like i am in this same cycle that i thought i had been working on but when i am asked about my weight i want to empty anything in my stomach and when i'm stressed i want to eat something that makes the pain go away i can't have friends that get too close and my mom is getting tired of it i just want to stop feeling subhuman.,
"i ate my fear food . yesterday i ate my fear food for the first time since i've started recovery. it was popcorn because i just remember i always used to eat a whole load of it then throw up. i didn't exactly choose to have this milestone when i did, i was just at the cinema with my family and neighbours and they bought me popcorn. i'm te only one who knows about my ed so i couldn't just say 'oh no thanks that's actually my fear food,' but i'm really proud of myself and just wanted to share that with someone. it was challenging to keep it down and i did have to go to the bathroom to take a few breaths but i haven't purged it and yeah i suppose i'm just happy because this is a sure sign i'm nearly recovered. given it's easter i might end up relapsing anyway because easter just comes with so much food it can be hard sometimes, but i'm trying my best not to and even if i do i know it won't be because of my fear food so that in itself is enough for me.",

question for recovered bulimics.. i've been recovered for a few years now but i've developed unbearable acid reflux to the point where i'm taking tums almost every day now. did anyone else experience this? i'm almost positive it's a result of 1 years of binging and purging but i really need relief ,

"next steps to recovery. after making a few posts on this subreddit, as well as the r bulimia sub, my gf and i have made huge progress in her recovery journey and i just wanted to know what our next goals should be. she has gone from p rging 4 times a week, to having months in between p rges. she is learning to be comfortable with eating above her personal dietary restrictions x amount of calories day and has even stopped counting for some of it. recently, she even overate and stopped the p rge on her own as she is getting a lot better, i need to know what we should plan on doing to help her get rid of this disorder for good. should we try and stick to the calorie restrictions? should we try and get rid of the restrictions? should we focus on removing the ""i'm not pretty enough"" mindset when she feels guilty after overeating? she is not perfectly recovered obviously but i know that we are close, and i just wanted to know what we should be doing to help her fully recover. thanks.",

"i accidentally triggered my girlfriends relapse and i feel awful. please help.. i love my gf a lot. recently she has opened up about her bulimic struggles and i have been more than willing to help her in any way she needs. for example, i'm making sure she doesn't p rge by only taking her to food options that she will ""approve of?"" i'm helping her when she is about to p rge and im trying to talk her out of it. with my help, she has gone from b p almost daily, to being b p free for almost two months. until today. today was our anniversary and she recently caught covid we both live with our parents , so i haven't seen her in a few days. i decided it would be a great idea to visit her with some gifts, and since she loves bubble tea, i ordered a size medium of her favourite drink. around 4 hours ago, i surprised her at her house with the gifts and everything was going great. as i was on my way home, she texted me saying how she feels the need to p rge after drinking the bubble tea i did not provide any other food in the gift, and i only added it to the gift because she said that anytime i gave her a drink she would promise not to p rge, not sure how, but she said it . i have delivered bubble tea i believe twice in this time frame where she has gone without b p, and everything has gone great. until today. that text worried me. i love her so much to the point where whenever she is in pain, i also feel the pain, sometimes even worse. i finally get home, and i'm frantically texting her, and trying my best to make her not p rge the drink that i bought for her, knowing that it will be my fault i helped her in similar ways when it wasn't my fault as well, just needed to add that . after texting and facetiming for over an hour, i finally just gave up because i could not handle the constant interruptions of me talking with gagging coughing. i tried my best. i really did. i was telling her everything that i could think of, i was doing research mid conversation to see what else i could say to possibly change her mind, but it obviously was not good enough. i feel terrible, my mood is ruined, and i am definitely going to get no sleep for the next few nights. she insists that it was not my fault, and that it depends on her mood. she also said that it's her fault because she could have just stopped drinking it when she knew that it was going to make her sick, but she continued. she said that its ok because she barely p rged anything. everything she says just stems back to me actually giving her the drink, which obviously makes it my fault. i can't physically help her, and i really want her to get better, but i just don't know what to do next. i want the best for her, i really do. i just don't know if i am enough to help her. i'm afraid she needs someone else who can help her more. i love her so much and the thought of me making her hurt her body just ruins my mental state. please help.",

"coping mechanisms?. i've been in therapy for panic attacks, depression, and bulimia for a few months and none of the coping mechanisms i've learned are working. my coping mechanisms for depression have been bulimia and panic attacks, and my coping mechanisms for panic attack have been purging and hugging being near my dog kahlua. my family moved across the country over the summer and i stayed in my city for college, so i haven't been able to be near kahlua since september. i've had so many intrusive thoughts of her getting hurt and it's led to many panic attacks and purging to get rid of how i'm feeling. when i want to purge my therapist has suggested that i sit through the feeling and wait for it to pass, but what ends up happening is i'll sit somewhere for hours extremely panicked and nauseous snd then i end up purging. she's also suggested that i meal plan so it is harder for me to binge but 8 of the time i purge i don't binge beforehand. what are positive coping mechanisms you've used to help with bulimia, even if they didn't work, i need more coping mechanisms.",

"living with a skinny sister. 16f here. my sister, younger than me by 4 years, keeps flaunting her weight around me. she is nearing 1 lbs and she makes me feel so huge. i know that i am not overweight but she makes me feel awful. i feel like whatever restricting i do isn't enough to get me to look like her. the problem is not in her size. i know plenty of girls who have stick thin bodies like her. the problem is her showing it off. and i am not talking about wearing revealing clothes or whatever bc that is not my business. i mean literally going around the house and bragging that she is x lbs. she is also constantly making comments about how my clothes fit so loose on her etc. it is so so triggering considering i am trying to have a healthy relationship wit food and exercise. i have addressed this with her and my parents and they always say that i am jealous of her and that if i am unhappy with my body then i should just do something about it. am i in the wrong?",
"help please : . hiya, i could do with some help. i m currently in anorexia recovery, i guess i m nearly weight restored? i don t really know as i have body dysmorphia. i think i m in quasi recovery i want to recover but i still have extreme restriction and bad self talk. throughout being at my lowest weight i would never have binge purge tendencies. however in the last few months, i felt i gained weight and loosing control due to being on a meal plan. one time in october i made myself sick after dinner and now whenever i feel i break a rule such as allowing myself to have a second portion at dinner or feel really full or have a desert after dinner i make myself sick. so i would say around 5 6 times recently of throwing up. the thing is in my head i see it as a binge but i think i am just eating normally? it s not like i raid the cupboards in sight of anything i can eat because i have to much of an anorexic voice in me. and whenever i end the day i m still so hungry even after dinner, my mouth still salivating at the thought of food . when i purge i can do it 6 7 times in one session but it s to mentally exhausting after a while, and sometimes i see blood in my sick. i have heard of people doing it for an hour or so so i feel like i don t have a problem. but do i ? ugh i m so stuck . i m to scared to tell my therapist because if she tells my parents i m scared they won t let me go back to uni. i used to take laxatives but they just made me really bloated so i stopped because it triggered my bad body image . i don t know what to do . i feel like i will never recover because i hate my body so much. any advice would be appreciated x",
"healthy and unhealthy eating pls help. my girlfriend has bulimia and we were talking about ways to eat better the other day, and we came across a problem we can t seem to figure out. she tells me she gets many mixed signals, she is supposed to trust herself but she can t identify when eating is good or when it will spiral into anxiety eating and she won t be able to stop and feel horrible afterwards, do you guys know of any ways to differentiate the two? or how to trust yourself without having the fear of it not being healthy to eat thank you for reading and any help at all is greatly appreciated ",

"recovered but now worried about consequences. i haven't made myself throw up in almost ten years. i was never just bulimic, i mainly restricted, would go through random moments where i would binge and purge or just throw up what i ate if i felt it was too much. i just discovered something called barett's esophagus today and i'm so worried. is this something that can develop after you've stopped vomiting? is it common among bulimics? has anyone been diagnosed with it? just in need of someone to talk to and stop myself from having anymore panic attacks.",
"help please. so it s been two months since i ve relapsed and i thought everything was doing well but i started having really bad diarrhea, like i eat something and maybe 1 mins later i m running to the bathroom and it s running through me. sometimes i have to go to the bathroom multiple times when i ve only eaten one thing. this happened the first time i tried to stop purging but once i went to the bathroom i was fine but this is just so much worst. i get these stomach cramps and i feel so sick and it just feels like endless. has anyone experienced this before and what should i do? i m really embarrassed and don t know how to bring it up with a dr",
"i m spiralling. any coping mechanisms suggestions?. hi, as the title says, i m kinda struggling right now. my ed is as bad as it was when i applied to a recovery program. recently i just moved to a different city and due to having a referral i managed to make my way to the top of the waiting list. however, i just discovered that i can t join their program as i will be unable to make the first mandatory meeting for the intro group due to having 2 exams during that time . so now, i feel kinda hopeless. i know that it s on me to recover and this setback shouldn t matter. but the stress i am feeling from school isn t helping with thinking clearly. does anybody know any healthy coping strategies? i automatically revert to my ed behaviours when i m feeling stressed and overwhelmed my friend recently asked me whether she can do anything to help. and honestly, i can t think of anything apart from me getting my shit together. but it s tough haha.",
i ve chosen recovery i think.. hi peeps omg i want to die i m binging right now and i ve just binged and purged at my friends house came home just to binge more. there s a halloween party tomorrow that i wanted to go to i didn t plan to binge and purge but this party made me so anxious as i am already gaining a bit of weight in my recovery with all this goddam retention. i ve got a question should i avoid going to parties while in my initial state of recovery it s just that parties make me go into a restrictive cycle and then binge after it s all over. i know i need to grow some balls and just face my fears but right now it s hard and i m 1 percent not going now. if i would be going i would purge right now yet again and down some laxatives and fast till tomorrow s party. this is so fucking hard i ve told my parents about my bulimia and i ve come clean about my restrictive rituals i.e. going to my friends house just to purge and skip dinner i only did this 2 days ago to start my recovery and let them catch me if i m going on a restrictive cycle. but now i m reconsidering it all is it even worth it if i can t even loook at myself in the mirror with my puffy face from all the water retention looking back at my skinny body and i think i was truly happy back then.,
bulimia cheeks. i ve been bulimic for almost 5 years now and i m close to fully stopping but it s like the effects have already taken a toll on me to an extent i have bulimia cheeks they re all swollen and i m scared even if i stop there s nothing i can do about it does anyone know anything i can do?,

ed support story feature instagram. hi everyone i'm currently in the middle of a struggle with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. it's one of many eds i've had over the course of my 16 years. it's been getting worse lately so i've decided to make an anonymous instagram nobody close to me knows about where i'll document my journey and share other people's ed stories if they wish to submit any in my dms. ill try to make it a space where people with eating disorders can vent anonymously or share experiences and stories to encourage all of us to work on ourselves especially those of us who are struggling and don't really have a suport group. kinda like on reddit. if you want to follow me on instagram or submit any stories i'll be posting these soon. it can be about anything you want to talk about safely and anonymously : i'm going to try and make this a helpful space for people to meet each other and maybe try and see if this can help me along the way. if you have any suggestions you can dm me here or on the instagram thisgirlseatingdisorder it's kinda weird but i just hope this helps other people. i hate going through this alone and i imagine there are other people who are going through something similar. we need to stick together and lift each other up. thank you for reading by the way i hope this doesn't come off as promo y. i am genuinely trying to make this a helpful thing lol,
"gastroparesis prokinetics?. hello, i'm almost a year into my recovery from bulimia and noticed that my body still takes a very long time to digest food. during my peak illness, i rarely ""ultimately"" digested more than 2 4 calories and now i probably am digesting closer to 1 . i'm sure my body is still adjusting to the intake, but it's taking a lot longer than i expected to feel normal. for those of you in recovery, is this normal? did anything help your gastroparesis delayed stomach emptying including prokinetic agents or specific types of probiotics? thanks in advance ",

"hair loss after relapse?. i recently had a pretty traumatic event happen that made me relapse and start purging again. it got to the point where it was just after every meal, so i probably wasn t retaining a lot of the nutrients. this has happened a few times before, but for the first time i m losing insane amounts of hair. i m talking full blown bald circles all over my head, i can t run my fingers through it without clumps falling out. i m sure there s a ton of reasons this could be and maybe part of its stress induced. has anyone else has significant hair loss after a period of relapse? on the bright side, i m more motivated than ever to stop purging because of this.",

"how to avoid purging after stressful situations?. hello i am currently on my bulimia recovery journey, and have been working through it consciously for the past 6 months or so i have been bulimic for 1 years . i ve typically been lasting about 3 weeks without having any relapses, however, now that my semester in school has started, i have been faced with numerous challenging situations that strongly incite an urge in me to binge amp; purge. i mostly do it following a stressful activity. my heart is racing, i have extreme anxiety and negative thoughts within my mind about the outcome of the activity, and i feel like the only way to relieve these issues is to exhaust myself through binging and purging kind of like a factory reset . if anyone has tips on how to cope with feelings of stress without the use of binging amp; purging to relax my body, it would be much appreciated. thank you ",
"acid reflux amp; recovery. hello, i'm currently in recovery for a 15 year long battle with bulimia. about a year ago i substantially decreased my frequency of self induced purging from multiple times per day to about once every few days and continue to progress. about 6 months ago, i woke up with a feeling of dyspnea and eventually was diagnosed with asthma i don't have a history of it . over this past summer, i found out i actually suffer from lpr laryngopharyngeal reflux aka silent reflux, which has been really dreadful to deal with and likely the cause of the asthma as the overlap is well documented. at the peak of my eating disorder, i was subsisting on a very small amount of food, and in the past year i've increased my intake going from roughly 4 calories to closer to 12 per day . i'm wondering if the lpr is the direct result of purging, or if it could be my gi system trying to process the increased amount of food that is no longer being regurgitated. or both. if anyone else in recovery from bulimia who has experienced or is currently experiencing lpr gerd acid reflux, i'd really appreciate your insight and especially any tips for symptom relief. i'm currently taking omeprazole daily and a slate of natural remedies apple cider vinegar, aloe vera juice, low acid diet, gaviscon sodium alginates . thank you ",
"trying to loose weight in a healthy way. last year i was very overweight and i ended up dropping lots of weight. i got praised so much. stating that i looked so good and beautiful; no one knew that i was bulimic and that s how i lost all of that weight. i ve been in recovery since december 2 2 and i ve had only a few times i ve done it. it s a constant struggle to eat food without wanting to get rid of it. since being in recovery i ve gained a lot of weight and the way people look at me is completely different. i m no longer beautiful in the eyes of my family members, friends and strangers. i get more unsolicited advice about what i m eating, how much i m eating and what clothes will best suit my body. i m so tired of it. i want to loose weight but in a healthy way, a way that i will be proud of myself for. i know that i should love my body the way it is but i don t, i just don t. that s why the ed happened, i guess what i m trying to ask is. where should i start? what are the best workouts to do? any advice from ex bulimics trying to loose weight. i just want to feel pretty again.",
"i'm panicking. i ve just gone through a good period with my bulimia, it s been almost non existent for over a year now. i ve still thought about food and struggled at time but the frequency of my purges has dropped to about once every other month from once every other meal. i ve been doing okay. however, this summer i ve put on a lot of weight, like a lot in my mind. several kilos. it may not actually be a lot but for me it s a lot. my clothes, particularly my jeans aren t fitting anymore. i have this one pair of baggy comfy jeans that were loose around my waist in may, and now i can barely breath in them. big life changes have happened this summer, i ve moved to another country, started a new job and made lots of new friends. in spain, food is an important part of daily life and the culture. people eat five times a day, four at least and there s special names and meal times for each of these five meals. at first it was overwhelming and definitely knocked my relationship with food. i feel like i ve been binging since i got here and now i don t know what to do. i want to loose this weight, i want my baggy jeans to be baggy again and i want people to stop commenting on what i eat. this is something that has always made me feel incredibly anxious and as food is so important here i find it s happening more frequently. eat more, don t eat this, don t eat that, you should try this, stop eating bread.. i know these comments shouldn t affect me but they do, they make my heart thump and i panic. my self esteem shouldn t be tied to my weight gain but it is. i feel like shit, like a stupid piece of shit who shouldn t have become so relaxed because look what s happened. i could easily drop 1 kg and still have a healthy bmi. my body fat percentage has never been higher. i hate myself for it. it s like i have the two little people of either shoulder, the devil on the left telling me to vomit vomit vomit and the insta fairy on the right whimpering shit like your body doesn t determine your worth love urself . i m pissed off. i ve never used bulimia sub like this before and this is my first post so idrk why i m here or what i m looking for, i think i m panicking? idk. but yeah, thanks.",
