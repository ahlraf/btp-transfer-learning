"the wrong pickles. this sounds really small but feels so big to me and i feel like some of you may relate, so i wanted to post here. my partner and i have been buying the same pickles for almost the entirety of our relationship 8 years . recently she went shopping on her own when i was away for a bit and bought a different brand style.. to cut to the point, i asked her if she needed anything on our grocery list and she asked for those pickles specifically. i asked if i could get the ones weve always gotten, and she said no she wanted these ones. i ended up having to step out of the room because i started tearing up, had to put a weighted stuffed animal on me and started dissociating.. over pickles. for awhile now i haven't been acting on ed habits yay , but still having bad intrusive thoughts and it's a constant struggle between body image and incessant negative thoughts to not break down. one of my biggest triggers is when my cupboards fridge aren't properly organized or foods we don't typically buy so wouldn't have a set place within that organization are bought. i end up in my kitchen for hours just staring into the void of my fridge cupboards moving things back and forth similar to that scene in for the love of nancy , and often just end up sitting on the floor exhausted.",
"just a vent. im having a hard time accepting the fact that if i am not restricting all the time i'm going to be on the heavier end of normal because that's just how my body is. i don't know how all the influencers online that have recovered from their eating disorders look like they do. i've been underweight or around that from the ages of 15 19 and i feel like i look my best at that weight, other people also seem to like how i look at that weight too. and if i recover then i'm realistically never going to look like that and i don't know how to come to terms with that. these past two years i have gained weight, a lot of it and i'm really struggling with it because not only am i fixated on it but other people in my family are fixating on it too. weight has always been a thing that people in my family comment on, they will let you know that you looked better at xx weight and that you're letting yourself go now. so right now i'm back home from university and my mom is still stuck in the past and keeps trying to make me eat like she did before and my aunts keep saying that i've gained weight and i'm eating too much of all the wrong things. where i live we don't have the kind of culture where i can avoid being around my family for long and i know i'm never going to be able to have a better relationship with food as long as i'm in this environment.",
"long term ed may finally be catching up to me. liver problems.. i ve had anorexia on and off since i was 13. i had gotten healthy for a while but the pandemic threw me for a loop. i started restricting again and became uw. i haven t had a period in years. went to the doctor for chronic fatigue and stomach pain. liver enzymes were through the roof. got some imaging done and it showed fat build up. doctor said it could be damage too. i do not drink alcohol and i eat healthy, although not enough. i ve read that liver damage is a rare complication of anorexia. i m scared for my health but i m even more terrified of gaining weight. i m going to see a specialist to rule out anything else that may be causing this. recovering will be a last resort. has anybody else struggled with liver or other organ damage from a long term ed? i m feeling alone and nervous. i don t have many people i can talk to about this.",
i randomly got my period today. for the first time in over 4 years and i m very confused. i went through a binge cycle and put on a few but nothing insane. i ve been eating maintenance to break out of it so i can start restricting again and i haven t been walking cycling as much because it s been like 1 degrees every day. i m conflicted bc i wanted this to happen so badly without going back to my hw but at the same time i am scared when i start tapering my intake down it ll go away again and i m scared of osteoporosis. holy shit i felt awkward going to the store today to buy pads like i m 11 years old over here,
guess it's bad. got downvoted. awesome. i am a piece of shit so thanks for the reminder and confirmation.,
"i just really am so upset right now specific numbers used . i went to the gynecologist yesterday and got weighed on the scale, which read 1 2 lbs. immediately, my mood went black. my scales at home an old digital one and a brand new digital one always say 96 99 lbs no matter when i weigh during the day and how much liquids solids i consumed. i am so so so upset reading that doctor office scales are more accurate. i've been running 2 miles a day minimum but have also been eating more. my waist has stayed 24 25 inches, but my lower stomach the fat under the bellybutton looks huge and protrudes. i feel so disgusting for letting myself eat so much. i've made myself fat and can't stop eating and i'm so scared i'm going to gain more and more and lose the only thing people like about me, and then what, i'll be nothing again. i feel sickened, i know this is a negative ugly post but i'm in a negative ugly headspace and i can't believe my body is ruined because of me, no one else. i'm scared i'll never stop binge eating, i ate a lot these past few days and i'm paying the price for it. please someone just tell me it'll be ok and that i can go back to normal. i'm scared i'm going to develop binge eating disorder and never stop",
"weight gain hurts mentally but feels good physically . gained 8 pounds but .5 pounds sends me into a downward spiral of how to loose it i hate this crap fckkkk why can t i just be happy already god damn it lol i want to go back to restricting so bad i m gonna try running at the park in the morning so i can try and balance things out healthier. if i go back to restricting, i ll binge and then purge. but because i ve been having trouble purging i ll gain. and that number will continue to rise not to mention the damage i ll be causing to my body. at the moment that s why i ve gained. i want to gain by simply eating right and not from failed purges. i ve been craving cheese and fats in general so tomorrow i ll try and get something with that down. but fuckin hell. the gaining in general when i look b at myself is so damn devastating i hate it. when i was well below the uw mark i felt so happy mentally being able to look at myself but felt so damn shitty physically. and now i feel like shit mentally and well enough to do basic physical activities. i can start working out again and such. but omg. i m barely eating and i m gaining so rapidly. ik it s cause the failed purges but i ve also been semi eating like i ll eat a 1 cals two hours before my normal b p times so i can force myself to keep something down. my metabolism isn t to bad surprisingly. from cheat days i ll gain like two pounds and thats about avg. if i restrict during the week i ll loose about 3. with successful b p and without b p i ll loose about 5lb. i ll maintain with failed b p.. so thats how ive managed to get up to 8lbs gained. a cheat on weekends and a week of failed b p. i reckon if i just eat normally and balance out my meals. i ll be able to simply maintain where i m at. but i m scared. like actually scared that if i eat normally without casting out cals through binging then purging i ll gain significantly more instead of maintaining. i hate this thinking. i just need a place to tell people my thinking cause paper has a special loneliness to it lol, posting makes me feel less alone honestly i generally crave veg, fruit, fats, meat and chocolate. if i m craving carbs it s usually straight up white bread. my strong cravings being fruit, ubread and chocolate. i like dark chocolate like fuck. all of which are safe foods like the one hurdle i m having is being able to eat in bigger quantities. like eating anything over 1 cals in a single session is so daunting. i managed to lift it to 27 but then i feel the need to not eat for the rest of the day which as we all know by now results in binging and guilt: then with me purgingggggggg we ll fail purges haha anywho it s just a constant struggle is all. like i can t say i m happy gaining 8lbs because i feel like ass when i look at myself now. plus i didn t do it in the best way possible think i might post diary entrees on here about my struggles , any suggestions on where it ll be allowed ? subreddits oo and i haven t been obsessed with rereading what i post so that s why it s everywhere. i used to be hella subconscious about how people view and read my post in fear of being judged or upsetting people i still am lol, but trying to be more lax about it bum dum tss also struggling with abuse lately but it s not to bad atm. mostly cause i ride the bus and it became very very problematic quickly ",

"activity level when it comes to deciding how many calories needed per day?. hey, everyone. what kind of activity levels are we supposed to input into calorie calculators? if i run 2 miles per day, should i click the level that's one above sedentary somewhat active ? i've been seeing certain subs imply that certain levels of exercise aren't actually as high as we might initially think, and i'm lowkey paranoid that i've been overestimating my activity level. i'm pretty sedentary otherwise besides the running and occasional walks",

"one week of visiting family amp; i m mushy and thick. deviating from my routine has been really hard. it s been the opposite of a vacation, but i made do with what i could do. not walking my 1 k steps, or doing my weighted pilates for a week and i notice my arms and legs have gotten mushy, lost some of the toned look. i don t understand how this could happen so quickly. my arms and legs gain weight so quickly and i haven t been eating much this entire week. i ve been restricting actually heavier than i usually do. makes no sense : . hoping that getting back in my routine will make my mushy thick legs go down.",
"how to stop the constant body checking weighing. literally driving myself insane. i have been body checking for copious years. many, many times throughout the day. i didn t even know what it was until about a year or so ago. i just thought i was insane, lol. wrapping my fingers around my wrist, touching my collarbone, sternum, spine, arms, etc. i even body check while conversing with people out in public. i am autistic, so i think it has become a sort of stimming behavior for me. even when i avoid mirrors, i do this. constantly. and if my upper arm feels even slightly bigger than it did the day before, it s enough to ruin my whole ass day and i m so tired of it. i feel like winter is easier because i can just hide in big cozy sweaters. but i can t seem to stop with the body checking or constantly weighing myself. it makes recovery progress so much harder because feeling things get even a tiny bit bigger is enough to trigger me back into restriction and compensatory habits.",
"massive weight cycling, anyone else? tw.. i m really upset with myself for my extreme weight cycling. does anyone else deal with this? i m talking more than 5 pounds up and down, again and again. it s getting so bad for me it s like every fucking year. it s so embarrassing . i think of how obvious it is i m always losing or gaining pretty dramatically. i have a crap wardrobe cause i hate buying clothes never knowing it s hard to handle seeing my body in photos because my body image hasn t had a chance to stabilize at one weight in years. i couldn t even stand seeing photos of myself when i got back to my low weight, cause the last time i was there i kept only the very best photos and looked at them to trigger myself, so now seeing myself in new photos at the same low weight was upsetting. this is not meant to be competitive and i really hope it can be accepted this way.",
no one cares that i m starving myself. i don t have the motivation to make myself anything to eat. it takes too much effort. this feeling is stronger when i realize that no one cares if i choose not to eat. no one cares that i m not eating enough. no one cares about my health. does no one care because i m an adult? is this how they live?,
"type 2 amp; ed tw . hi all. let me know if this isn t the right sub for my questions processing. tia tw for mentions of medical testing, food, weight loss, exercise, etc. no specific numbers recently i had routine blood work and my numbers indicate pre diabetes. i ve been researching how to prevent pre diabetes from developing into full on diabetes. most of it has to do with addressing diet and body movement. i m honestly a bit confused and triggered by these results from my blood tests. i ve always had blood sugar readings on the lower end, and suddenly they re high. my triglycerides have historically been within range, and suddenly they re all messed up. all of this is coming after months of losing weight in a healthy way. not engaging my ed to the best of my ability. it has taken me a long time to get to a point where i can lose weight without triggering my ed, and now this pre diabetes diagnosis is thrown into the mix. it feels like a huge monkey wrench. i guess my question is: should i begin focusing on all of the aspects that the who and cdc recommend for preventing diabetes? these include staying away from certain fats, increasing body movement, losing weight which i m already doing , etc. i m fearful that doing so will trigger my ed further, but i m also terrified of developing diabetes. thoughts? any ideas, recommendations, consolation welcomed. thanks again.",
"sorry just a rant.. yesterday i drank a lot. ate unsafe foods. purged. drank more. ate more unsafe foods. passed out and woke up today around 9am. then i found out that me and my family were gonna go out to eat later for lunch 1pm . long story short i caved and made an excuse i had to get my card inside and that they could wait in the car a bit. i go inside, open the top cabinet and take out the bottle of lax i had hidden. i drink three servings and meet them back in the car. fast forward we re at the restaurant and i put up with same crap that always happen when i order steamed veg. do you mean this points to a greasy asf fck stir fry ? no, i m sorry could i just have some plain steamed broccoli? oh well we have this. points to different oily garbage is that what you want? i m sorry i don t understand what your trying to order. can i have plain, just plain broccoli, on a plate with nothing else on it? that s all i would like please. just plain broccoli on a plate. oh well i m not sure if they do that, but i ll ask. rest of the table orders and food arrives. sets a plate of steamed carrots and broccoli down in front of me thank you. fast forward past the non stop comments of you want some that s all your eating here have this . we enter the annoying small talk. brother in law: i m already getting full. i don t think i can take another bite. referring to the appetizer of egg drop soup that was served in a tea cup sized bowl sister: yea me too. while main course s are being delivered to table they ate their food while continuously saying they were full. my sister ate like three pieces and was pretending to be stuffed. her husband ate like half of his massive portion. ughhh like okay???? like omfg why is it y all get so damn full after two bites of fuckin food and still weigh xxx pounds?? like y all eat when y all go home, y all eat crap all the time. but only when we go out do y all pick at y all plates. ik for damn sure when y all head home with y all leftovers your both going to eat that in addition to that stupid ice cream you kept pushing on me. why can t we just go out and have actual small talk?? no. better yet let s stay home let s stay home and i ll cook for y all. it ll taste better and i wouldn t waste 82 fuckin dollars on food your just gonna fuckin peck at. like bro ughh i m not paying for us to go eat food. i m paying for the day out. to eat out. that s why it s pricey. the least y all could do. anyway. it s bad enough to have to do the whole damn back and forth with the waiter and whoever they need to bring over to clarify and make an even bigger scene. but holly shit i can t even enjoy the overly priced rabbit food? i gotta listen to these people who are getting free food talk badly about my mom while she s their. i cannot speak up. i can t. i ve tried, and i m immediately left completely with denial and self hate for not being able to. i hate them. honest to god the fact that their so fuckin judgmental. jesus fuckin christ. like the waiter made a comparison between me and my sister that we looked like my mom. instead of letting my mom get just a lil bit of enjoyment from it cause she s been so stressed with moving and been trying to get me to go back on my word and move in with her i ll worsen my stupid ed, you ll understand that at the end my sister gave this upsetting almost disgusted look and looked at her husband at which he replied with justifying it. he said oh the waiter just said it to be nice. it s just a phrase. he didn t mean it. ?? my mom sat their in silence and just smiled while trying to enjoy her food. i just stayed silent b c i m tired of having to stick up for her and just be ment with walls on all sides..i i m just so damn drained from these last two days. like omfg man. once i m back home and they leave i have to listen to my brothers degrade her worth and the food she just bought for them 5 i gotta listen to her complaining about how full she is, how it hurts etc etc. like ughhh i m sorry if this doesn t make any sense. i m just so done with my family. i m tired of this ed crap too. everything just makes me want to unalive myself nowadays. i don t feel like i have a voice. i just want out already. i want out. take it, take everything just leave me alone. for fuck sakes. i can t wait to move. ik it won t take away my worries but it ll give me a place to go away and breath. just fuckin breath man. anyway once i got home i went to bed waking up occasionally to take a dump. 3 4pm speed a couple hours later and i finish off the bottle of lax, make some detox tea and eat a fiber one bar. it s so hard keeping my stupid b p crap in order though with how my family behaves. i m aware they all prolly struggle with disordered eating but jesus christ. i m trying, why can t y all help me a little bit and just acknowledge what s y all doing is fucking me up even more? ik that sounds selfish but all my worries come from a place of love. ok what i said and it s typed said from irritation with everything b c we don t talk like a normal family. everyone has their own head up their ass and doesn t just want to come to a damn agreement. and i m just tired of picking up their pieces already. hence why i m moving and trying to recover b c i m not going to stay here. if i must stay here, stay breathing and all that crap. i m not going on like this. aight no damn way. i m going to live right by me. i m getting my voice back again. sorry this was hella long, if you managed to read this far you care more then most people and i just want to tell you thank you for listening. you have no idea how much that means to me especially in the current state i m in. don t worry : i m staying up tonight and i m just gonna relax with my detox tea and watch non food or ed related crap on youtube. still working on cleaning my medias of ed or triggers lol again, thank you ",

"sometimes my character forgets to read from the script so carefully prepared by the censor my eating disorder ....in that moment i am not the actor who circles the stage.. i just wanted to write this and share it with the subreddit the cassette catches the reel. the magnetic tape weakens. at that point of contact it finally tares. those pre recorded lines seem to become corrupted. those words are no longer binary products of an eating disorder. as quickly as they were created to sooth the suspicions, the behaviors, the absences, the many many rules. something loosened the tension to the point of a slack hemp rope. i forget the most important object in my life is my eating disorder. i just risked losing it, risked removing it's reticence, risked its restraint, jeopardized the cold comfort it sets in my life. ""i never eat more then 1 kcals a day, if i do....well i will run that off no matter how late it is. i mean i have ran at 2am. well closer to 3am, 4am."" i suddenly become a synonym for fear. my eyes narrow. my throat dries........ i feel the tension tighten. i can't fill my lungs with oxygen. i cannot for the length of that conversation comprehend the mayhem of the chaos i have summoned. i think please don't take this away from me. don't look any further. do not push against the open door....don't regret your kindness or confuse guilt for support. like that the vain fearful nature of humanity tempers any further inquiry. the comment goes unattended. no surprised tone, no judgement of erratic behavior, no reflection on my words which by an act of exhaustion have been liberated from the scribes quill. the statemen has been redacted from general publication. omitted from public consumption. i feel almost pious. august despite my chains. maybe she knew or simply is too ineffectual to care. you see my friend you cannot fail to project the signs of anorexia no matter the size of the stage or the time taken to thread the boards. no prop can obscure my thin shoulders. nor can any scenery deflect from my gaunt face. nothing but the final applause can hide the lost years of my life. maybe my anorexia is lady macbeth, my bulimia that scottish play that must not be spoken and drunkorexia had spoken my words to the frailty of the danish prince's madness. did she know fair is foul, foul is fair or that ""my words fly up, my thoughts remain below."" though i would reason no one seems to reflect on my efforts to my treasons.... but they are my reasons mine and mine to live alone. like the meticulous nature of a sunrise or sunset in its benign nature the malevolent attributes of concern pass. i reset....call to my understudy line, line fucking line now. the play proceeds till the curtain falls. thank you i just wanted to reflect on some thoughts out loud with the group.",

"actually found the courage to call a treatment program, only to hit a huge roadblock . so the long story short, i contacted a hospital in early july to ask about their eating disorders programs they have a partial hospitalization program and an intensive outpatient program. the ball had really been rolling for me to take an extended leave from work from september december to attend these programs and find a way out of this. until yesterday. the man i spoke to is going to speak to the dietician today and make a case for me, but i might not be able to be vegan in treatment. i m in panic mode right now. he knows it s an ethical lifestyle for me, but he s concerned about diversity of food options and balancing nutritional content. i m freaking out. he s going to call me today, most likely. i suggested bringing in my own foods after working with the dietitians to make sure they meet requirements, and he said he would mention that. i have been vegan for almost 15 years, and it was never used to fuel my disorder. i told him that it actually opened up a whole new world for me with food. if he calls with bad news today, i m going to tell him that i won t be doing the program then, and that it s a shame that rather than work with someone on fixing unhealthy and disordered coping mechanisms, they d prefer someone to abandon an entire belief system. that cannot be the answer. being force fed to eat something i m morally against consuming seems very counterproductive. here is someone who finally mustered the courage to ask for help and started to make a plan, and you re asking me to abandon an almost 15 year old belief system? it s not an option. i just needed to rant, and vent. i still haven t heard back, but i feel so anxious and rejected right now.

"i always need something to obsess over, and right now this is it. weight loss is my favorite obsession. it makes me feel the most in control. i feel so proud of myself. i was obsessing over the people in my life, but now that i ve switched gears and made this my main focus i m over the moon. i love being fixated on my weight and losing. it makes me feel like i have a purpose in my sad depressing boring life that i m completely unable to find fulfillment in. i know this feeling isn t forever, but i want to ride it for as long as possible just to feel something overwhelmingly positive for the first time in a long time.",
"the amount of i m no longer attracted to my spouse partner because of her his weight gain posts is triggering and infuriating af. i see copious posts like this in the marriage and relationshipadvice subreddits. the op always mentions loss of attraction and not even being able to look at their own fucking spouse and always asks how to point out that there spouse has gained weight. they always make sure to include that their wife sometimes husband looked amazing and fit like a supermodel and was really into going to the gym eating healthy until it suddenly all goes to shit. but how should you point it out? literally fucking don t. i m sure the person you are with is well aware of their weight gain and having to deal with the crippling realization that their spouse is no longer attracted to them would probably be enough to lead to a full blown eating disorder, if they didn t already have one. my abusive ex constantly made comments about my weight i was always at a very healthy bmi and compared my body to the bodies of other women. but he would constantly tell me how perfect i would be if i just lost ten pounds, putting me in the uw category. looking back on it now, he was without question fetishizing anorexic body types. he is precisely what led me to developing a full blown eating disorder that i can t shake a decade later. and the comments in these posts are loaded with fatphobia and toxic diet culture, like suggest meal planning healthier meals, exercising together getting a gym membership. maybe it s a mental health issue binge eating. and there are always even worse comments like, you re still young and haven t been married long. you should get out while you can. your spouse let themselves go and you deserve to be with someone who will take care of themselves and their helth . fuck that. people would literally suggest to leave the person someone vowed to spend the rest of their life with over fucking weight gain. like, are you serious? i have a feeling these subreddits are full of awful cis white heterosexual males who think women naturally look like supermodels. it is a full fucking time job to look anything remotely close to that. it is an illness. it is exhausting. and bodies are supposed to change. but how can i ever recover when this is how people view weight gain? i am incredibly fortunate to have found my husband who has never made me feel like these men. in fact, he always finds me most attractive when i feel like i look like a hot mess sweatpants, hair in utter disarray, no makeup, etc. . he has never expected me to look a certain way pressured me to be thin. but it s terrifying. i am doing my best to challenge my own internalized fatphobia which i do still struggle with. and these posts get me so heated.",
"recovery and feeling warm slightly sweaty after eating?. so i've been trying to recover and do the 3 bigger meals 2 snacks in a day. it's been going ok, not perfect everyday but most days. my issue is that i feel so warm, sometimes even hot to the point of slightly sweating after eating. does anyone else experience this? if yes, how long did it last? it makes it slightly more difficult to try and maintain this meal plan cause it just feels yucky. i hope it won't last too long. i have my next appointment at the end of this month, so i wanted to ask here if anyone else has similar experiences.",

"roommates with forbidden food and me with ed bd?. recently moved in with roommates, which i think will be good for me long term but i'm worried that i'm going to end up loosing it and binge all of their ""forbidden"" food they keep all over the place. i am trying to recover for 2 months now trying to find a therapist specialized in ed but so far i will have to just rely on my regular therapist until i find someone more versed in this issue and i'm not restricting myself in calories any longer. however when i tried going full ""eat whatever you want"" mode i just end up binging bad. i'm not at that stage yet where i feel like i can just let go of the reins completely. i have been able to have pretty good success with just focusing on eating healthy and ""maintenance"" calories, and keeping my triggers out of the house. but now with moving into this new place with all of my triggers everywhere... i just don't really know how to handle it. i already ate a little bit of something that wasn't mine after spending two days thinking about it nonstop and telling myself not to do it. i feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. it's one thing hurting myself with my ed but it's going to effect other people possibly too ... has anyone been in a similar situation, does anyone have any advice on how to compartmentalize my ed so that i don't end up eating other people's food? update: definitely feel a binge is inevitable. well i made it two weeks without restricting binging. that's longer than... well i can't really remember when actually. maybe i'm giving up too soon but right now everything just feel a little too much. thank you everyone for your replies and help, it's all appreciated, just having a hard time not feeling fatalistic about the whole thing right now. a little hopeless i guess. maybe when i get an ed therapist maybe it will help?",
"these last months i bought binge food with the joint account and my husband noticed it . my husband decided to check and reorganize the management of our joint account because we hadn't done it for a long time so it wasn't suitable anymore and needed to be put in order. problem is: i don't always pay attention to the bank card i use between my personal account and our joint account, and it happened that my husband noticed a lot of expenses in bakeries because obviously i bought a lot of pastries with the joint account card... and while tracking and listing the expenses, he checked some name of the beneficiary company to know what it was and like he said: "" i discovered a lot of bakeries "" he didn't say it like an accusation since, fortunately in this case, he can be very naive and oblivious, especially about domestic life so i'm pretty sure he didn't really question the amount of money or the frequency of the purchases. knowing him, i guess he was just surprised and he joked about it. and another fortunate thing is at the beginning of our relationship, i explained to him that when i'm stressed, depressed or bored i tend to overeat biscuits, chocolate, etc. i said this because i didn't want to reveal and explain my bed problem, also because he's unable to understand this kind of thing, but i wanted to have an explanation if he notices weird behaviours, food wraps in the trash bin, etc: so i said this semi truth semi lie to cover my back in case of. and since the first half of the year has been stressful, i guess he filled in the blanks: depressed and stressed wife overeating to deal with bad emotion a lot of expenses in bakeries. so i'm pretty sure the case is closed because for him there's nothing abnormal, he just wanted to clean up the management of our joint account and he's unaware about a lot of things, including ed so that's all, but i feel a lot of shame and guilt about this... i guess i'll have to be more rigorous in the use of my bank card to be sure to use the one from my personal account...",

"blood donation woes. today was a real mixed bag of fucking ridiculousness, i just feel like i want to talk as my husband will not understand and i don't talk to my therapist about this stuff. i've gained some weight due to the fact that my entire family and myself have pretty much been sick with one virus or another since probably march. so i've been home either sick or caring for sick children, and my food and exercise routines are all out of whack. from august last year till around two months ago, i was finally almost at my lifetime ""goal weight"" which forever changes, but i was very much in the ballpark and feeling so good about being on top of everything for once , but i've been thrown off course by all constant illness. today i went to my blood donation appointment. i had the interview beforehand and because my weight is a little higher than it was at my donation a month ago i was able to donate more blood today, which should be a good thing but of course i felt like a huge failure and so embarrassed. we move to the donation chair. as usual, i had barely eaten beforehand, and hadn't drunk as much water as i should have, because one of my motivations for donating blood, besides it being a good thing to do to help others is to burn maximum calories, i.e. by eating as little as i can before and after, to get the biggest calorie burn possible. i know this is all so ridiculous, and probably not even real. normally it doesn't affect my donation, but the trip home can be a little lightheaded sometimes. today, i was obviously dehydrated so the nurse missed the vein in one arm, and then when they got the vein in my other arm, it was a really slow flow of blood and blew out and caused a haematoma, so they couldn't proceed today. so now i'm back home, i've got both elbows wrapped up, a large painful swollen arm and bruise where the vein blew, and i can't donate again till next week. i'm disappointed that my ridiculous restrictive behaviour and obsession meant that i wasn't able to donate. it's times like these i really notice how messed up my brain is. on the way home, i couldn't stop ruminating on the whole situation, i feel shame for having gained weight, and disappointment for not being able to donate and frustration and anxiety for my calorie burn plans being thwarted for today. i feel like i'll be a failure forever, my weight is out of my control and i'm basically out of control in life. no balance. i'm a grown adult with kids and marriage and a career, this shouldn't be what's happening for me. ugh. thanks for listening, it helps to get this all out. hopefully i haven't said anything inappropriate here.",

"my experiences with coolsculpting and cooltonr. i mostly identify as post ed. i haven't purged in months and genuinely don't want to purge again. i have some days where i eat more than i should but not an out of control binge and some days where i eat below maintenance and feel fine. in doing so, my weight has been pretty stable, a high ""normal"" bmi, but i'm noticeably getting more fit as i've been consistently working out more. i feel satisfied that i look good enough, even if i could look better. i feel satisfied that i eat well enough, even if i could eat better. it's better. so if i'm pretty much at peace, why would i want to get cosmetic procedures to change my body? recovery warriors would decry my decision, saying i should learn to fully accept it as it is. but i thought it would be worth it, far more worth it than any ed behavior. the idea behind coolsculpting is that when fat cells in an area are pinched off, frozen to death, and eventually cleared by the immune system, it reduces the fat levels in the area proportional to the level of fat in the rest of your body. as we know, fat gain and loss affects fat everywhere. someone with a bbl won't lose her relatively big booty if she loses weight, and someone with chunks of fat removed from her breasts in a reduction won't get huge boobs again if she gains weight. my desired results wouldn't be something i would have to micromanage daily. the long term proportional change would persist at any weight although it's most pronounced if you're not too lean but not too fat for a clear contrast like me . the first thing i got was flanks. no matter whether i was at my fattest or my thinnest, i didn't like the inward dip. i thought my figure could look so much more womanly if only its width would keep smoothly increasing from my waist down to my hips. for one side at a time, i endured the tight pinch of the applicators, the sharp cold that soon turned me numb, and the godawful massage afterwards to break up the hard crystallized fat. i thought i was going to look so newly shapely at an event later that week. imagine my shock when i was told it was going to be extra swollen for days at first, and only after a month would i start seeing the difference, with final results after three months once that time passed, i did notice. it felt weird for my hand to brush by my hip and feel a nothingness where the boundary of my body was once expected. it indeed gave me smoother uninterrupted curves, and my hipbones were pronounced the way they were at a lower weight before. i thought, thank you now that i knew it worked, i booked my next appointment tummy. they said they wouldn't do my upper abs because there wasn't enough fat to pinch, but i could do lower abs. who wouldn't want a flatter lower belly, right? this time, the two minute massage was torture. the fat had to be broken up vigorously over my organs, not backed by nearby bone; last time i couldn't help but go ""ah "", but here i couldn't help but scream and cry. one minute has already felt like way too long ""is it almost done? "" when i was told ""halfway there "" for a week afterwards, my tummy was bruised and painfully swollen. i'd like to say it worked. but i honestly don't know how my lower tummy would look different now at my level of fitness had i not done it. this seems to be a common ""didn't do anything"" area anecdotally unless you have a pronounced tummy and get multiple rounds. my third appointment, since i couldn't do upper abs, was frontal bra line. the pinch hurt worse, but the massage was so easy, since the fat was being crushed over my rigid ribcage. now i have ribcage definition at a higher weight than i've ever seen it, and my bras feel more comfortable. proper fitting clothes feel much better on harder body mass. i do wish i could've gotten upper abs to even it out, though, because i think my waist is less inwardly curved in comparison now. then i got cooltoning, better for tummies with less fat to lose and also buttocks and thighs . the magnetic stimulation feels bizarre; it makes your abs suck outward harder than ever, painful at first but easy to adjust to. not everyone can handle 1 intensity, but i could. the muscle toning is real. it gave nice results and pushed me further along in exercise progress. there are some people who get procedure after procedure, never satisfied. but generally, cosmetic procedures have been found to lead to lasting satisfaction with one's improved appearance https: nautil.us the loophole in the hedonic treadmill 4482 . these are largely safe procedures, and as long as you promise to treat your body well afterwards, i recommend them to anyone who's interested.",

"stupid question about fat free body weight tw numbers . i have one of those smart scales that tells body fat , muscle mass, bone mass etc. it also shows regular weight and fat free body weight. there is a gt; 23 pound lt; difference between the weight v fat free body weight, so does that mean i have gt; 23 pounds lt; of fat on my body? so theoretically if i lose gt; 23 more pounds lt; i wouldn t have fat i know muscle gets lost too but not sure in what ratio muscle and fat get lost ? the app that comes with it shows your data in a scale of low high depending on what it s reading, but it doesn t have that scale for the fat free body weight so i don t know if gt; 23 pounds lt; of fat is a lot or not or what the normal amount is, i m 5 9 if that makes any difference.",
"very sad and scared, need some advice. tw: numbers i lost 2 pounds in 7 months with high res, i was losing a pound a month, which is reasonable weight loss, right? of course, i did get down to a bmi of 14. after that, i snapped and gained all the weight back plus 2 pounds more in just 3 months i don t understand why it happened so quickly cause i still lost at a reasonable weight and i don t understand why i went so far over. i also wasn t doing it for very long ever since then i ve been maintaining but i ve still been lowkey restricting cause i m always fucking hungry still even after i just ate i still think about food way too much despite being more than weight restored. so because of that, i feel like i can do nothing but gain weight. i just wanna go back to how things were before. but i don t know how. i just started therapy but i don t know if it ll help. i really really wanna restrict again but i don t wanna fucking deal with this bullshit of counting calories anymore. but i also can t stand being where i am. i have all this brand new cellulite that makes me feel fucking disgusting. if i were to lose weight again, i would want to do so healthily, but what would be a good deficit for someone with a bmi of 2 .4? i have no idea. i was in a deficit of 5 before. idk how i got into this mess and i don t know how to get out of it. i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started taking levothyroxine about a week and a half ago. i ve heard that a lot of people lose weight on that pill without even changing anything. i m discouraged i haven t lost any yet, although i know it hasn t been very long. i feel like i m losing my sanity more and more with each passing day.",

"1 days purge free . i can officially say i m never going back. as hard as that must sound to believe after only a week and a half, i genuinely believe it. i have hit this point before but was more focused on continuing to lose weight immediately and would get triggered and relapse every time i felt bloated, gross, ate too many calories or the wrong foods that day, etc. but now i have found tools that make me feel like i can succeed. i swapped all of my vitamins for a solid multi added back in some animal foods to get my b vitamins , take a probiotic with fiber, make an effort to drink as much water as i can, bought clothes that are comfortable for both work and working out when i m not feeling great, try and move my body every day, and honestly, sometimes i live off of gas x. i m still tired and sometimes i still eat more than feels good and think about purging for a second, but then i skip it it s not worth going through the weeklong purging withdrawal of bloat, digestive issues, chugging electrolytes, puffy face, etc. the determination to permanently quit, above all else, is a necessary precursor to ceasing behaviors. i think the reason quitting b p worked this time was a mental switch, honestly. i have thrown myself into my life and try to focus on what would feel good in my body before i do it. i don t force a meal plan on myself nor restrict things i like i try not to think about food at all. sometimes i eat once a day, sometimes i snack all day, sometimes i drink a beer for breakfast, and overall i think i m developing the most normal relationship i ve had with food since developing anorexia 5 years ago. honestly, it feels at this point like bulimia was a weird, horrible dream i ve finally woken up from. hang in there, guys. if you try enough times and believe in yourself, you will get there.",
"i m feeling conflicting thoughts about ed spaces. on one hand it is great to have a place to air out your thoughts and get helpful advice to reduce harm. on the other hand, even without intent by posters i ve picked up hints and tricks and such i never knew about beforehand. i see people try to censor themselves or not mention things directly, but it is not hard to figure out what people are talking about. when you are sick and desperate you will try anything, even if it came to you in a post warning about avoiding that thing. the mere mention of disordered things is like an infection when you have an ed. but you can t talk about ed issues without dropping these accidental tips and such sometimes, and it feels inevitable to an extent that things will slip through and new information will be gleaned by someone reading. i have no real conclusion to this post, it s more me thinking aloud and interested in others input on the matter. i will say i feel this is more an issue with the other ed discussion sub than this one. this one does feel more cautious and careful to not purposefully trigger people.",

"semi recovery. i've been in semi recovery for a while, and i'm honestly over it. a couple years ago, i decided to actually care about my health. since that point i've considered myself to be in semi recovery since i'm at least making an effort. there's been some ups and downs and some big steps forward. but in the last 6 months it's mostly been sliding backwards. these days, i feel like my recovery is tenuous as fuck. if i didn't have a support system around me, i would most likely go back to all the behaviors i worked so hard to get rid of. i remember how things were pre recovery and i don't want to go back there. definitely not. but today and tomorrow, it's easier to just do what feels natural, feels right, makes me feel good. i know there are consequences but i feel like my mind fucks me over every time, telling me, ""x issue isn't due to your ed you've been so healthy lately it's probably something else "" maybe this sounds stupid like...obviously your increase in symptoms is due to an increase in disordered eating...but i guess i have a mental barrier there. i keep having this feeling like i want to give up. i want to be done with all this. i don't want to relapse, i don't want to keep fighting for recovery, i just want this whole part of my life to be cancelled. i keep fantasizing about running away and changing my identity or whatever. it's weird too because i don't think my situation is that bad. just to give context i've lost gt; 5 lbs lt;over the course of gt; 4 lt;months and my bmi is gt; 22.1 lt;currently so physically not much is going on. i don't want to lose more weight. mentally i'm still so much better than i was in the past, that it's hard for me to see that i'm still having issues. not sure what the point of posting this is, i'm open to suggestions but also just speaking these thoughts has been good too.",

"could you live with someone that was severely uw not due to an ed and always talks about how much weight they need to gain?. sorry if this is triggering. potential tw. the guy i ve been seeing for four years is poly. he started seeing this girl. she s my height and dozens of lbs lighter than me. she s severely uw. she has gastroparesis so it s not her fault, but she throws up almost every day due to it and i guess can t eat regularly. i know she s in pain and isn t happy. he s always texting me with concern and telling me her weight. it s so fucking triggering. she constantly talks about being uw and how she needs to gain weight. she always talks about how much she hates being uw. she cooks massive portions and wants to feed everyone but obviously can t eat herself. he wants me to move in but that would require me to see her every day. i m not trying to be insensitive but as someone who has suffered with an bulimia bed on and off for ten years this is almost a nightmare scenario. it s not her fault and it s due to her health but i m so torn. has anyone ever been in a situation like this? it s horrible to say but it would almost be more bearable if she had an ed so we could relate to each other, but all she talks about is how much weight needs to gain and how she wants to be at least 3 lbs heavier despite losing more and more weight every month : ik it s my selfish ed brain talking but ugh",
"need advice on identifying whether or not i am relapsing. so i know that i should speak to a doctor but for various reasons that would come with a number of issues that i'd like to avoid. so i had an eating disorder as a teenager pretty severe at times from around 13 to 21. i'm now 29 and had spent the past number of years eating fairly normally, with a few remaining ""quirks"". however, i have experienced a lot of trauma in these years and have a number of other mental health issues, that were massively exacerbated by getting neuro psychiatric long covid last year. i had been struggling with a neurological disorder for a number of years prior to this and everything got a lot worse with the infection. it also really affected my ability to eat food and my body started reacting to everything and i have ended up only having a few foods i can eat so i am currently on a very restrictive diet of only a few foods. i also started intermittent fasting so i would have fewer food reactions. so the way i interact with food resembles disordered eating superficially. however, i am not actively restricting food quantity and i am not making an effort to lose weight. but i also feel psychologically unable to force myself into purposefully gaining weight which i should do, as i am a fair bit underweight now . that doesn't seem to be limited by physical symptoms but i can't seem to get into the mindset that would allow me to do this. also, i have been spending quite a bit of time looking up celebrity bmis and weights, looking at photos of thin celebrities, examining my protruding bones in the mirror etc... and i think this is because things have been so incredibly hard that my brain resorted back to what it deemed to be a coping strategy in those teenage years: ""at least i am communicating my emotional pain through my body, even if that won't get anything addressed."" so yeah, the latter part of the 2nd paragraph definitely sounds disordered but is it still ""a disorder"" if i am not actively restricting food quantity?",

"found out former friend from ed forums passed away. too much alliteration in the title... i participated a lot in the online forums in the 2 s, especially futurebird's thin pages. there were meetups etc, all sorts. i became good friends with one girl because i ended up moving to the same city she was living in. we fell out of touch mainly my fault, because i went from 'successful' purging anorexic to just not thin enough bulimic and felt too ashamed to be seen by anyone . i've thought of her since, every now and again, reread our emails, thought i should message her. but always felt too much of a failed anorexic, more than anything. for some reason today i googled her, and found out she passed away a year ago. she was older than me, but still, very young. i feel lots of things, i feel so so so sad. reading all the messages on her funeral notice from people who felt so sad for her and her struggles, who cared for her, all the positive messages about her. i feel like...what if i had got in contact earlier? i'm so sad that her life had continued like it had been, for so long. i'm so sad she never made it to something else. i'm so sad she never even made it to 4 . but also, very selfishly, i have lost my final remaining link to a huge part of my past. when all the forum drama happened, i lost access to all my posts, to the community i was part of. i have, as i'm sure many people do, such poor memories of the times i was most ill, and i was devastated when i lost that. my former friend remained the only person from that time, the only person i still potentially could have contact with who was part of it too, who shared all that. so i also feel locked out, for good, from that part of my past. just wanted to share.",

""chewing gum is food. there s cat food in there too. the alcohol will sustain existence i guess."" as she hands me my change and i allow it to pass to the charity box which i don't read, contemplate, examine or allow the subject of the box to influence my day except the touch of the sun bleached plastic now rigid by the passage of years and the indiscriminate clanking of the coins. i am brought back to that guilt i am so culpable of enshrining in that taste less remark that s not fair to someone who is trying to be a human being with empathy and concern while i am resolved to be a creature not unlike a man. that is simply the product of many metal moving parts. ""it s hard giving up smoking. good for you. stick with it."" ""oh the chewing gum....no i didn't give up smoking...i gave up food."" when my operating system resets i remember i am not fully recovered. i am missing memory capacity and my data has been corrupted. so i agonise on that missing information. then i realise that s why i am so protective of my eating disorders. that s why i feel guilty. that is why as i approach my forties my life seems less vast and ineffectual. its feels less important and contradictory to my 2 s and 3 s. my eat disorder seems less of a burden and more of a sense of intimacy lost. my one true childhood love. my teenage reckless affection and my adult desire. when i become despondent or depressed by the loss of social contacts and contracts that i ended or lost. i remind myself the moon can never fall in love with the sun since neither will meet in the day or the night. though they still pursue one another s affections. finally, i take comfort in the fact the moon can gaze upon the stars in all its glory. slowly i am accepting the consolation..... i will not and no one will love this creature made of mercury. but when i look up at night, i can see the stars. thank you for reading i just wanted to write this. where people would understand. be safe be well, be good to yourself and allow others to be good to you.",

"should i tell family i have ed?. i've had ed since 14, i'm f33 now. sometimes it gets better sometimes it gets worse. it's definitely pretty bad right now. i'm going to be visiting family for almost two months and i'm really really really having a lot of overwhelming anxiety over this. i know that i'll be unable to eat my regular safety meals, of i restrict they'll know, they'll pressure me to eat etc. my behavior is so weird right now from the outside looking in, i just know it will be such a stressful situation and i am truly terrified that i will gain weight. i am loosing sleep over this shit, my mental health is in shambles. so my question is: should i tell my family about my ed? has anyone else done this and what were the results? did people respect your needs and boundaries when you did? i'm pretty sure my family is aware already that i have ed, or rather that i had ed at some point i guess my bmi just went back to being in the healthy range and everyone pretended that my ed went away too. i just want to have some space to navigate this scary space btw recovery and illness on my own terms, and in my own time. but i'm afraid that their response is going to be forcing me and pushing me to eat, which is going to make me spiral out of control. i also just recently got my big sister to admit to our mom that she has a drinking problem, and i confided in her that i have ed. part of me feels like i should tell my mom about my ed as a sign of support for my big sister too ... she's been so brave and i'm.... a bit of a coward?",
"how does one transition from throwing up calories out to working out calories out ? but doing it non obsessively?. the throwing up part is easy enough to do but leaves me so damn exhausted and weak. not to mention all the negative affects it has on my body. i m currently trying to recover but want to start to incorporate more workouts into my daily routine. that being said, along the journey i ve developed this obsession with obsessively walking off my calories. it went from just walking off surplus to wanting to walk off everything and then some. like if i eat 5 cal i ll have to walk or burn or know that i can burn it off in addition to cushion cals. basically non existent cals: working off whatever is in me from whenever i last purged . my knees were starting to hurt a couple weeks ago from it and i realized what i was doing was the opposite of recovery. so now i m trying to eat more but just casual walking. my knee pain has improved but i don t want to just walk. it s nice for a stroll but i want to get muscle. i want to be able to build my body back up so i can bulk up my intake without feeling bad about it because i ll be working out. i know this thinking will end me with a different diagnosis so i m concerned and looking on what to do. any suggestions?",

"eating disorders and abusive relationships tw for dv and sa . i posted this in the main edanonymous sub but figured i'd post here too.... i've been thinking about this since replying to another post yesterday and i thought it would be worth trying to start a discussion. i'm not saying i'm an expert on this topic btw, though to be fair i fucking should be at this point, god knows i've got plenty of experience to draw on. obviously this is a generalisation, but in my experience people with eating disorders tend to be more vulnerable in relationships, whether that's because of low self worth, pre existing trauma, dodgy health, etc. and let's be real, the type of people who are attracted to you when you're actively disordered tend not to be... the best. i'm 33 and i'm now in my first ever healthy relationship. prior to this, i was famously bad at figuring out when a relationship was abusive. like, i literally spent my teens and 2 s legally classed as ""vulnerable to sexual exploitation"" because i was such an utter liability. as an example... after i broke up with my most recent ex, i very reluctantly spoke to the police because he was literally stalking me and sending me v disturbing material. they asked if the relationship had been abusive, and i was like ""naaaaah... it wasn't healthy but i wouldn't say it was abusive "" they asked more questions, turns out not only was it definitely abusive, they considered me at high risk of literally being murdered. i'd managed to convince myself that stuff like breaking my fingers and strangling me til i lost my voice and had black bruises around my neck, was no big deal and probably something i deserved. that stuff wasn't even the reason i broke up with him. this guy was super into me being younger than him, and very much encouraged my eating disorder he wasn't overt about it, but he definitely knew what he was doing. imo those things are both massive red flags. as it turns out, he ended up admitting to fantasising about my childhood abuse and apparently moved on to trying to find images of the abuse online that's what he says at least, def could've just been looking for images in general . obviously this is a bit of an extreme example, i guess my point is that normal, healthy, supportive partners do not encourage eating disorders. it's not normal for severely unwell people to be someone's ""type"". it just isn't. i also think, if someone is saying very triggering things about your body or if they encourage you to restrict lose weight whatever, knowing you have an eating disorder... they most probably know what they're doing. it's not a lol boys are so dumb situation, or a case of someone being blunt or socially awkward. they know it hurts and for whatever reason they've decided to do it anyway. doesn't automatically mean they're a predator, but at the very least it's a shitty thing to do. idk. is this something people have noticed or think about much? do you guys think you've got what you need to figure out what sort of behaviour is or isn't ok? do you know what steps you can take to protect yourself if you need to? like i said, i'm definitely not an expert but i have a lot of information on the topic lol.",

"my mom triggers the fuck out of me and other things. i feel so angry. sad. and triggered. this literally happens whenever i am around my ed mom. we have such a complicated relationship. i m really not even sure anymore if you can call it a relationship. yesterday we all went out and it was really nice spending time together as a family. but i m starting to notice things now that i previously didn t as i process all of my unresolved trauma. last night i realized that my dad is also deeply affected by ed, and i m not even sure he realizes it. my mom s ed affected us all. me. my sisters. and my dad. no one was immune. we were out from 6pm until almost 1 :3 pm. my dad mentioned towards the end that he was hungry. he then said he hadn t yet eaten that day. i was mad and surprised to hear this. my dad is 66. i asked why he didn t eat before he left the house, knowing that we would be out late. i want him to take care of himself. he then said that he and my mom don t usually eat until 8pm or so. i said, why so late? he just kind of shrugged. he then texted me after we all got back home and said he had a salad. a salad. that was all he ate all day. and my mom never cooked growing up, so everyone was left to fend for themselves. i recall my dad often snacking on oreos and ice cream. none of us have ever had a healthy relationship with food. we also had a family picnic last weekend and i brought ice cream sandwiches for everyone as i didn t want to come empty handed. there were quite a few leftover and i left the box in my parent s freezer. my dad finished them off, like multiple at a time, and last night he was shaming himself for it. he grabbed his gut and said he can t lose it. it s like my dad is stuck in a binge restrict cycle and he doesn t even realize it. it breaks my heart. my dad was also super fixated on getting in as much steps as possible last night. everyone in our family wears stupid fitness trackers. my sisters and now mom are marathon runners. i am a long distance runner and even my dad has taken up long distance running in his later years. but he was absolutely obsessed with the steps last night. my dad and i were kind of joking around about getting our steps in. i didn t really like it, but my dad kept pushing the issue wanting to know how many steps i was at. my dad doesn t know i have relapsed, so he didn t understand that what he was doing could potentially be triggering. my mom does know i relapsed though. she was the first one to notice. at the end of the outing, my dad asked how many i had and i told him. it was a high number. he was disappointed in himself as his number wasn t as high. and he s like, you went for a run today, didn t you? i said yes and then my mom said, well i got insert astronomical numbers of steps here . and then she proceeded to say, i get up at 5am every day and go for an hour swim, then go running for a few hours later on. and then she goes swimming again. she does this every single day. i was seething with rage by this point. she knows i relapsed. and i m trying to understand how she claims she is concerned about me when she would deliberately trigger me like that. and she acted cold towards me all night last night, so i don t believe she is clueless. my dad also got out of the car to hug me goodnight and my mom didn t. she just said, bye . i know eds can be competitive in nature, but still. it s just really hard for me to believe anything other than that the only reason she wants to call me out on my relapse is because she views it as a competition between us both. and today i pushed myself even harder on my run. she s in my head and i can t get her out. i vented to my husband about everything this morning and he gently reminded me that she struggles with mental illness too. and that s what ed is a mental illness. but still. i m tired of having empathy for her. i m tired of being triggered every time i see my family. i m just tired. i just have so many emotions after last night. i feel sad knowing just how much ed has impacted my entire family. i hate that i have to realize and process all of this. it is exhausting. i feel for everyone especially my dad now. i am struggling to feel anything other than hatred towards my mom right now. and maybe that is the ed part of me expressing that hatred, but it s palpable. thank you for letting me vent.",

"someone finally commented on my weight loss. after months of trying to lose weight. someone i barely know, who i ve only been around a couple of times, commented on my weight today. none of my close friends or anything even noticed. so i guess i haven t really lost much anyway. it only made me want to keep going and terrified that i ll gain the weight back. i still have a solid 1 lbs i d like to lose. but more so just body composition change. finally starting to feel better but the only reason is because i m losing weight. when i lose weight and am closer to my lowest weight, that s when i m happy. im so scared that i won t continue to lose and i ll gain weight out of nowhere and just fail miserably again. so much anxiety right now and i don t understand why. i felt good earlier. but now, the fear, the worry, the regret for eating too much tonight even though i know i didn t eat enough to gain weight and im still in a deficit.",
"i achieved a brand new goal after 15 ish years of treatment for a ""severe and enduring eating disorder"". i am doing super well in my recovery from c ptsd and anorexia and or arfid who the hell knows after spending the past few years on a palliative care approach. the eating disorder has literally been a lifelong thing relating to abuse and neglect from a young age. i now almost have a bmi of 18 which has never happened in the community before, only in hospital very briefly. i did it on my own, i still have to use supplements but i've done it voluntarily with no hospital, ng tube or ultimatums i'm ""allowed"" to have a lower weight but i wanted to be better.",
"had binge eating disorder as a kid. i got better when i went vegan. but years later i have drug induced anorexia. my weight loss is giving me gender dysphoria.. i ate healthy for years. i was over weight because of a cystic disease but i loved being the short chunky guy. i liked how my body looked, even with my big butt. i finally got diagnosed with autism and adhd and was prescribed a non stimulant of all things. my autism gives me hard core side effects to meds. i started loosing alot of weight because i lost all my appetite so eating makes me so depressed because i loved food and cooking. i wanted to cry when i tasted the vegan cheesecake i've always loved and felt disappointed. and now, i'm starting to get curvy in all the wrong places. i don't mind having an ass but now i can see my hips more. i wanna cry and throw up. i just keep thinking i look so much more feminine now. it disgusts me. i miss being square. my clothes are fitting me even worse and now theres such a huge contrast with my ass. it's not like a chunky guys bubble but anymore. it's like a womans fat ass. i'm even getting dysphoric about being anemic. i wish i could stop these meds but i'm a wreck without them. i can't even sit down and feel calm in my own home without them. i'm trying to eat as much as i can but i eat and i get sad because it doesn't feel good anymore. it's starting to feel weird to have food in my stomach. i just want to enjoy food again. i never knew how much i liked eating until all the enjoymentbwas taken from it. i'm so bummed out",
"i can t get married while still struggling with my ed. i recently made it to 6 days without b p and have been in a hell of a relapse since, also getting drunk a few times a week and generally not giving a fuck. i ve gained quite a bit of weight in that time too, which makes me feel even worse. a lot of things have been going to shit, i got promoted manager level at my job lol i can t even manage myself , my family is a disaster, my dog just died after a week of sudden paralysis. my boyfriend and i have been discussing marriage and met with a priest i m catholic for a superficial preliminary discussion about that. i went to a different priest for confession this morning and the topic came up, he said that no priest in their right mind would allow me in my current ed drinking situation. i knew that i needed to resolve this before and it wouldn t be fair to my boyfriend to get married with all my baggage, but somehow that statement was still a punch in the gut. so here i go, again, trying to stop b p and cutting down on the alcohol. i m starting to feel a bit hopeless since every time i try i end up failing.",

"dae get terrified that one day you re just going to tragically gain tons of weight because of hormones?. i listen to a lot of podcasts about hormones and healing auto immunity. and the stories i hear are terrifying. they re usually along the lines of all of a sudden i woke up one day and was 3 lbs heavier and i didn t change anything this is my biggest nightmare. i am finally starting to feel ok in my body and it s only because i ve been able to lose a tiny bit of weight and work on my thyroid and auto immune issues. but i m seriously terrified that all of a sudden my cortisol or hormones are going to say fuck you and i ll end up like one of the women on these podcasts. i know this is a normal deep seeded fear with ed, weight gain in general, but the older i get the more afraid i become. so this is why i am strict, keto, fasting, orthorexic etc and i sometimes would rather it be this way than recover and be forced to gain a bunch of weight. the recovery realm really doesn t jive with me it s so black and white. i feel better now than i ever did when i was my heaviest weight. i feel happier when i am thin and losing weight.",
"triggered by someone in one of my fb groups. i feel so stupid for letting this get to me like it has. i commented on a post in one of the halloween lovers facebook groups i am a part of expressing a viewpoint different than someone else about freaking halloween decorations, but this woman took it as a personal attack and the claws came out. she insulted my appearance and said i look much much older than i am 3 yo . she is super pretty, thin, which made me feel worse. it felt like being bullied like how i was back in high school. she basically said i look like an old woman and attacked my mental health and said i was trying to make her feel miserable like how i feel every day. i fortunately thanks to my own therapy and emotional maturity gained over the years said i was not going to engage with her. i know i shouldn t let stuff like this get to me, but she hit me right where it hurts and i m now ruminating about it. i ve always been so insecure about my looks and it has been getting progressively worse with age. now i just feel awful. social media is poison sometimes.",
"venting about the ed always being around the corner despite all the progress . i hate how on a daily basis i feel i found a balance between the ed and the ""real life"" husband, work, hobbies, etc but how much the lesser change ruins everything and reinforces the ed thoughts and behaviours. it's so frustrating and it always makes me as much angry and sad each time. so here are today's examples... tomorrow is a bank holiday where i live and bank holidays are so triggering because they are the perfect opportunity to binge eat: no obligation but time to eat and time to rest... since i have one binge eating episode per week for a couple of years i try to stick to this schedule to deal with the bank holiday: i can only binge on weekends, no exception, as hard as it is. anyway, my plan was not to binge, to follow the usual routine and all, so no food shopping or anything: i stick to my routine and there's usually no binge on thursday, this is what i do since more than 2 years so i can do it this week. so i was in this good mindset, repeating that i only have to do what i did during the last 11 weeks, it's totally doable, everything gonna be fine, etc, and then bam , we've been informed of a major change of the work hours and schedules because of the current heatwave. and of course, it immediately caused me some anxiety and, since binge eating is my coping mechanism, a massive urge to binge. i tried to breathe and stay rational, to calmly assimilate the informations and their impact, there's nothing complicated or grave, but the pulsion to stuff myself was so strong that as soon as i could take my lunch break i went to a supermarket to buy some sandwiches, pastries and donuts... which is stupid and i hate in itself, but even more because it incidentally cancel all the previous efforts related to the bank holiday... tl;dr conclusion i hate how my anxiety and so bed make me unable to deal with unplanned things, even the littlest ones, how i need my routine to deal with life, and how the lesser change causes amplifies some binge eating urges which can totally overwhelm me. i hate how each progress limiting enough the ed to have a semblance or normal life is so precarious and never acquired. i hate that my instinctive reaction to anything unusual, any strong emotion, any change, etc, is to gobble food. i try to see all the progress i did throught the years decades, and it's a lot, but it still seems so uncertain, and sometimes, like today, it also seems vain... it's tiring...",

"do yourself a favor and if you ever have the opportunity to try magic mushrooms or psilocybin, do it.. 18 only i mean, be safe about it, but please, at least consider it. seriously, please. my personal experience: the first time i tried magic mushrooms was in january of '21. i felt euphoric and noticed a lot of simple pleasures i had taken for granted before then which was cool. at one point, i was so warm i took off my shirt and was hanging in my apartment in a sports bra. i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and for the first time in my life i truly loved myself, flaws and all. i loved my body genuinely in a way that i thought other people only faked for views and likes. i tried an apple and, for the first time, i saw food as nourishment and not just a necessary evil that my flesh prison demanded. after that i started eating whole fresh foods and cooking real recipes, working out, building strength, and loving my body. it completely changed my relationship with food, exercise, and my body. a year and a half later and i take them once every few weeks to few months as needed and have gone from a suicide attempt in 2 18 to loving life in a way i never thought was possible. the last time i tried to run before my trip, i broke down crying after about a minute because i hated myself so much and vowed to never run again. i'm currently training to run a marathon. my scientific background: i hold a msc in biomedicine from tufts and wrote my masters thesis on psilocybin therapy. some highlights include: they are one of the safest, if not the safest drug you could possibly try, including weed and alcohol there is no medically documented instances of hallucinogenic perception persisting disorder sustained hallucinogenic symptoms after the initial trip from psilocybin despite there being hundreds of documented administrations of the drug. that is, no permanent negative side effects. there is, however, anecdotal evidence online of such instances in treatment of depression, psilocybin showed efficacy in 7 of patients compared to lexapro's ssri 3 similarly promising data exists for treatment resistant depression, eating disorders, and ocd administration of only a few doses 1 4 has been shown to yield sustained positive effects on mental health up to 6 months afterwards, meaning no need for daily medication and no sustained side effects beyond the first 24 hours following administration they also pose promise as treatment for ptsd, inflammation, anger issues, social issues, addiction to other substances especially alcohol or opioids , and more i'm happy to type up more info on how to explore this safely or to post my thesis if people are interested. no judgement if it's not your thing, just hoping even one person might benefit from my sharing. edit to clarify some good points people keep making: part of being safe with this is making sure that you are in a positive mindset when you take them and are ready to heal. also avoiding psychoactive drugs until you are closer to 25 is good advice as well. be safe and do your research.",

"dae struggle with understanding what bodies genuinely look like relying on numbers in recovery?. i know for some people numbers can be really triggering like oh i'm x weight and y height, i work out z times a week. but i find it really comforting when strangers share that with images of themselves? i struggled badly with body dysmorphia and needing to achieve the ""desired"" figure to the point where what i wanted to weigh didn't look like real people at that weight at all. i'm in recovery now, but this skewed perception vs. reality thing is still affecting me. i've found looking at images of strangers and acknowledging that they look happy and healthy or whatever, like not ""bad"" whatever that means, thanks brain and then learning their numbers is helping me slowly correlate that those numbers are not ""bad"" either. like seeing someone with proportions similar to myself, or at a weight i was at previously or i desired to be helps me see myself more clearly. and then, as my body changes i'm able to incorporate these new understandings to my own numbers and be kinder to myself than i once was because i have a better understanding of what i might ""actually"" look like compared to my own dysmorphic conceptions. like oh, my insert problem area probably isn't as big or noticeable as i think. or oh, this woman has expressed this insecurity but i didn't even notice it so maybe other people really aren't noticing mine either. obviously i know no one is obligated to share their proportions or their own struggles because that can be triggering for them. but i've always found that using and acknowledging numbers has made me feel more grounded in reality, and that people sharing theirs helps me a lot. does anyone feel the same? or do you have the exact opposite experience?",

"possible triggers, removed numbers problems with food stemming from short term poverty? is this possible?. cross posting this from r edanonymous. i am a male student who for 9 months was unable to find work and lived off of a disturbingly low budget did not really recognize how bad it was at the time . my weight plummeted because in order to pay for other things i had the mindset that i could just skip meals. i ended up moving and finding a part time job and while i'm still struggling i am able to afford an appropriate amount of food and am sometimes getting food for free. i am budgeting properly and know how my money is being spent and how much i can still spend, but i am fearful of spending money and keep reverting back to eating less. it is true that not eating would give me more breathing room, but i am able to get by now without skipping meals. i've told myself that i'll look better skinnier anyways and that i don't want to gain back the weight but i honestly feel less healthy and weaker and want to be back to normal, but at the same time i am pretty accepting of where i'm at and don't fear getting worse, but i also do? i try to snap myself out of this kind of thinking and just eat normally but i feel guilty if i spend money on food or go over removed calories. i don't bring food to work with me and i try to go to bed on an empty stomach. there are some days where i aim to eat as little as removed calories. i also feel really full and uncomfortably bloated if i try to eat my old normal now. i end up eating around 2 calories on the odd day where i feel particularly weak. i realized i might have an issue after eating around 2 calories the past few days because i have felt so fatigued at work, and this resulted in me feeling too full and also very guilty and thinking about eating less again. one thing i did not mention in the original post is another fear of regaining the weight comes from the fact that i am no longer able to do strenuous activities like i did before because of an injury. i fear regaining the weight because i won't be able to put on as much muscle. does this sound like an issue with eating? how can i start fixing it?",

"my therapist said something yesterday that left me utterly speechless. i had stopped seeing her for almost three months due to my relapse and i told her yesterday that i could no longer in good conscience continue seeing her while deliberately hiding my relapse. but it became too much. the weight was too heavy to carry on my own. but i didn t want to burden anyone with it, especially because right now, i have no intention of recovering. i hid it from everyone. my husband finally said something after my mother reached out to him and he admitted he noticed how much weight i had lost and wasn t sure how to approach the subject because we all know how complex eds are. they have copious triggers, which must be approached very delicately. and i do know it s exhausting for people to know what to say and how to say it. my husband expressed his concern and he expressed concern on behalf of my mother. so i made an appointment with my therapist. no more secrets. yesterday, i said to her, why is this all happening now? like, all of these things from my past, why can t i just get over it? because outwardly, things in my life have never been better and it s true . so why can t my stupid messed up mind catch up with me? and she said that s exactly it. she said, you have been through so much trauma and there are so many complex layers and you have just been moving through it. surviving. you never had time to pause. but now you have stability in your life. you have a stable job after years of instability. you are in a stable relationship and now married after years of abuse and unloving partners. and even your relationship with your family is much better now. so now you have time to pause. you can start to digest. and she said that it is just too much for me to pause and allow the feelings to come up that have been building over decades and i just can t allow myself to feel all of this pain and digest everything. so i fall back onto my ed as a means to cope. and it really shook me to my core. like, it really does all make sense now. i am not ready to recover yet. and i know like any addict because that s what an eating disorder is i have to be ready to recover, but i am at least grateful i confided in her. she is a safe space. i am at least grateful i don t have to harbor this awful secret anymore and i have someone who is qualified to help me carry it. maybe one day i will choose recovery. in the mean time, i am doing what i can. i am doing the best that i can.",

"my wedding dress doesn t fit.. just need to vent and maybe get some kind words. i ordered my wedding dress in the spring and it finally came today. lo and behold it s too small. and i m so mad at myself. mad that i tried to recover and just let myself enjoy life, and food, and my wonderful partner, and now all i can think about is how bad i feel about myself. mad that my own body dysmorphic mother said that dress isn t made for people with hips when i showed her a picture, and mad that she was right. i nearly had a full blown panic attack just trying to wriggle the dress off of my stupid body. fighting tears i called the store and asked if the next size up was still available, which is already humiliating, and they said every size is sold out. my brain is screaming at me to just restrict, over exercise, do whatever needs to be done. go back to the old me who kept a list of not just safe foods, but only eat this and only this much foods. sorry for the rant. mostly i m just sad. i m letting a stupid dress color everything i feel about myself.",

reminders of being healthy that i hate. one thing i hate is pooping. i know gross and sounds dumb as hell but i hate it. if i poop it reminds me i ve eaten enough to poop. i usually go once a week if that and my husband found out and has been furious about it. he says i need to go once a day or every two days but for me it s something that s supposed to be positive but i turn it negative quickly. i also get weird about not being dizzy or being too dizzy. i don t know why but they are reminders i m not dying and yet it pisses me off. weird.,
"i d like to go back to the deepest part of this relapse. it s been since august. things in my life were out of control then, and i feel like they re starting to spiral once again. but my ed and the relapse felt like a warm blanket. like i was a fighter, surviving. i was seeing results so it was positive feedback that i so badly needed. people have asked me if i ve been sick. so many people asking what i do or what s my secret mental illness ha . positive feedback from someone i so desperately sought approval from in the form of sexual attention but also emotional too you haven t been eating, i ve noticed. i needed his seal of approval in other aspects, but instead he validated the very thing i thought i wasn t good enough to have an eating disorder. i had been seeking that approval since i was 15. he fueled this whole thing for me, he kept it going unknowingly. i m still here. i tried my hand at recovery and at least i m not restricting as low, but it s very much still here. just not what it was. i want to go back to the beginning of this relapse. that desire helps me realize there is something so much deeper to this all. i have lost what chaos caused me to jump back in. that should be a good thing. but it s calling me back, and i m finding it hard to say no. it s literally abusive, and it s hard for me to say no. i ve started going out and drinking a lot to deal with this. it works with my ed cause i just exercise that much more. but the drinking is just making me feel darker. im doing it in an attempt to go back to august, it brings back memories. but that s impossible. i can t stop living in the past. i m in a place where i need positive feedback again. i need somebody. i want my bad ed back.",

"my toxic routine might be slowly ruining my organs. i've found a really bad way of suppressing my appetite. i can't do coffee anymore due to gastritis, and can barely stay on tea because even the little bit of caffeine makes me really anxious and shaky and gives me bad stomach cramps. i've found that if i take ibuprofen, i become too nauseous and tired to eat anything, and somedays i don't even think about food because of it. i lost a considerable amount of weight a couple of years ago, and it was because i had given myself an ulcer and couldn't keep anything down. it was extremely painful and i have no interest in experiencing that again. but i just couldn't ignore how much weight i lost in the process. i've developed a routine that has kept me with perpetual gastritis that physically stops me from eating most days, but i can keep the intense stomach pain down because i just take ppis to counteract the ibuprofen. this routine has been going on since my early teens, and now i'm a young adult in university. i really believed for years that i could just do this routine forever and keep the weight off lose as much as i wanted whenever because i was taking the ppis and, thus, i was safe. but i've recently become aware of how ibuprofen damages the kidneys, and it was only after some concerning symptoms began occurring that i looked over my medical records and noticed a downward trend in my egfr. my pcp has not mentioned it to me, likely because i'm younger and people can have fluctuations in their egfrs that are normal. i'm pretty sure mine is normal, as well. but i'm unhappy now that i know i can't continue this routine of mine if i want to have healthy and functioning kidneys when i hit middle old age if that's even still possible now . i don't have faith that i can stop, though. i've habitually associated every piece of food with taking ibuprofen for an incredibly long time, and it's become like a punishment. my god, it's so incredibly toxic, but it works so well it's terrifying. i feel like i have the devil and angel on my shoulders because gastritis has been the perfect cover for people around me who are suspicious of the weight loss or vomiting; they know i've had ulcers and chronic gastritis and so they just think i'm one of those people who can't eat a whole lot. and no one is suspicious when i refuse food because ""no, no, i can't; my stomach is bothering me right now."" and yet, it's turned around to bite me in the ass because now there really are foods i can't have, such as coffee, which was a really great appetite suppressant for me, but i can't have it now for fear of the scorching hot lava it now produces in my stomach. the nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramping keep me from gaining weight, but it's so so painful; i love it but i hate it. it's completely changed my microbiome: one day i'll be cramping hard with constipation and the very next is all liquid. every time i pee it's disgusting and foamy and i wish i could just go back to the coffee because at least it kept me regular. i have been looking into some better ways of suppressing appetite, such as fiber supplements. and i think they could lead to enjoying a healthy meal more, which i've been striving towards. i've read that taking a fiber capsule before a meal slows digestion so you get full faster. i don't know. i'm leaning towards that right now as an alternative because i just don't see this routine being able to last much longer, or, rather, me being able to last on it much longer. end of rant.",

"partner made me choose between him and my ed. hi, i m the sad bitch who wrote in a couple of days ago about declining dinner plans because i didn t want to give my future stepdaughter an eating disorder. partner had a sit down talk with me and asked me to choose the kids or my ed. first of all, they re not even my children and i ve done nothing but treat them super well. also, an eating disorder is not a choice and i can t be fucking bothered to choose recovery for children that aren t even mine. i adore those children, but not at the expense of me spinning out and having anxiety from trying to recover and feeling like my relationship is on the line. i can t just recover because someone wants it on their timeline. so i made my choice and as heartbroken as i am, i knew i am not ready for recovery and there wasn t any point in trying to pretend like i was. i don t like to lie and i don t like to lead anyone on. share with me ur ed breakup stories. i need someone to sniffle into a tissue with.",

"i m 3 years old and my biggest trigger is my mother and i hate that i am becoming her. long post. i need to get my thoughts out and hear from anyone who can relate. thank you to anyone who reads. i strongly believe that what ultimately led me to developing an eating disorder was my mother. my mother has an eating disorder. and i m just now beginning to process it and it feels incredibly overwhelming. my relationship with my mother has always been so strained. so much trauma. the mother wound is real and i think it is largely because of her eating disorder. she couldn t mother me or my sisters in the way we needed her to. my dad described her like another child to take care of, feeling like he had 5 daughters instead of 4. my mother has never been able to take care of herself. she only is able to work part time and she literally could not survive on her own. looking back on everything, it all makes sense now. hindsight really is 2 2 . i started putting the pieces together back in 2 16 when i had relapsed. little things she did, they started to make sense. and her health issues really started to explain so much. i actually asked her, do you have an eating disorder? i wanted to know. a part of me needed to know. i didn t get an answer, but her unwillingness to answer was itself an answer. she has always been small. in fact, i recall my sister and i discussing that from behind, when trying to find her at the grocery store, she could be mistaken for a child. at certain times, her voice will often match childlike and innocent sounding even though she is nearing 65 years old. my sisters and i were always left to fend for ourselves when it came to meals. she never cooked. she still doesn t. and she had our whole family s normal as one meal per day. something i still do decades later. she was always sick and by sick i mean vomiting. she would always be in the bathroom. she would vomit regularly. usually after meals, or late at night when she thought everyone else was sleeping. she still vomits regularly. and i think now it is because she has gastroparesis. she struggled with low blood pressure and passing out when i was younger. i remember she actually had to carry a blood pressure monitor with her for a time. she has thyroid issues and needs to take medication for it. every time we go out to eat, she takes approximately 3 bites and then always claims she is too full to continue. she has brought her own salad dressing when we would go out to restaurants. she has dealt with severe chronic constipation for years and relies heavily on laxatives for relief. she hoards food and there would be so much expired food that would need to be thrown out whenever i or my younger sister would visit. she had a scare with her liver some years ago. she has had issues with her bladder for as long as i can remember. she is always freezing and needs to have a sweater with her at all times. and now in her later years, she has taken up long distance running. the weird things still continue. the not eating more than 3 bites and asking for a box. she was one of the first people to realize i had an eating disorder. and i think it s because she knew what to look for. she knew the signs. and part of me feels like she felt like she had to compete with me. and every time i start to look too thin for her liking, she will make it known. she has even reached out to my husband before, likely projecting. but still, she wasn t wrong. i have so many feelings that come up when it comes to our relationship. she couldn t be the mother i needed. the mother my sisters needed, too. and today, she still isn t. she simply can t. but today, i am able to look past the hurt and hatred and see a woman who is also seriously wounded, that came from a traumatic background and likely used her eating disorder as a coping mechanism. just like i have. and the thing that terrifies me most is that i am becoming my mother and i try tooth and nail to fight it, but i can t. the more i fight it, the more i realize i am acting just as she did. just as she does. i am terrified for what this means for my future. i struggle to hold a job. i use my ed as a coping mechanism to in a sense, rebel against the responsibilities of adulthood. i just want to be a child because i feel like a child. i feel like i truly am not cut out for this world. and i think that is how my mother felt. that is how my mother still feels. and i can t help but feel a profound sense of sadness in place of the anger and hurt i have felt towards her all of these years. because i get it now. i understand her anguish because now it s my anguish. and while part of me still feels hurt and angry, it wasn t her fault. she was just traumatized and addicted, just like i am. mom, i forgive you.",
"is my doctor an idiot?. at the insistence of my husband, i went to the dr and fully admitted i'd been diagnosed with an eating disorder. she didn't ask too many questions but my husband wanted blood work and all that so i did. and she knows i drink and she and my husband hate it. so she gave me medicine to curb my craving for it. i am also on bupropion and asked to raise the dosage. she acknowledged that it can suppress appetite but agreed. so last night i take the new no drinking medication and i don't feel like drinking. or eating. anything. no urge to binge. nothing. so last night i look up side effects. and google suggests the question does x drug help with weightloss. so i click it. and apparently this drug and bupropion are being studied and shown success for weight loss when taken together or even in one pill form. is my dr an idiot for giving it to me? i am on the low side of healthy weight not quite underweight and i feel like i've been given this opportunity and why wouldn't i take but i think i see clearly enough she may be an idiot. but between these 2 drugs and no calories from alcohol i feel like i'm set to hit my goal. and now i'm debating waiting a bit before i tell my therapist.....",

"from the bottom of my heart, fuck scales. weighed myself for the first time in a year and it spiraled me as the weight was redacted pounds higher than i had guessed. i track measurements and mentally match them to when i used to weigh myself regularly. i've been working on body neutrality consistently for 6 months and have been going strong on exercise to make me feel good, not to punish myself. weighing so much higher than normal triggered the shit out of me. i altered my diet to go right back to restrictive and skipped my weekly rest day. turns out the scale needed recalibrating and i'm right where i thought i was. the body hatred that i felt during the week was seething and stressful. it was enough to tell me that there's no reason i ever need to step on a scale again. fuck scales.",
"can't be bothered anymore. i see a lot of posts like this so i apologize if it's repetitive, but i just have to say that i never thought that i'd start feeling apathetic about my ed. i mean, i still have a lot of rules and rigidity regarding food. i'm still terrified of being overweight, but not to the extent that i used to be. like, if i'm going on a long walk with my family, i'll eat more than usual so that i don't feel like shit. in the past, i would never do that. yeah, i feel guilty, but i just tell my ed voice to suck it. it's like my ed is an annoying pest that's never going to leave, so i've just decided to try to live with it in the least harmful way possible aka harm reduction . we both have our desires and we both stomp on each others quite often. at 22 years old and dealing with my ed since i was 13, i can't be bothered to listen to everything it says anymore. i'm gonna have that extra spoonful of pb because i want it, gosh darn it. and i've done enough research probably years of my life if i add it all up researching stuff about nutrition. one spoonful of pb is not gonna kill me. skipping a walk will not make me balloon up. no food is good or bad. the anxiety and guilt that i feel for eating to raise my low blood sugar or heal my pounding headache is unjustified. another example is that i started birth control. in the past, i would only go on certain forms bc of fear of weight gain which there is so much misinformation about online. do your own research and i'm sure y'all will be relieved . even though i was terrified and felt so guilty starting it, part of me just didn't care that much. i thought, ya know what, maybe i will gain some weight. maybe i'll hold onto a bunch of water and my boobs will grow. maybe i'll be super hungry. but it's better than being pregnant and having painful, hormonal acne so just deal with it, ed and honestly i think i have gained a bit of weight and it does make me anxious, but as long as i don't keep gaining then i'm fine with looking a bit puffier...but ofc that's the problem with eds. give them an inch and they'll take a mile.

"fitbit, exercise, and chronic health problems: a vent. tw: mentions of weight gain fluctuation no numbers my so bought me a fitbit for my birthday last summer, and i am religious about wearing it. however, last summer i was also diagnosed with long covid, and have been being treated for it ever since. after my first time catching covid, my symptoms were primarily gi issues. that in combination with being put on an elimination diet, and then getting the fitbit and exercising more, caused me to lose a fairly significant amount of weight rapidly, to the point where i was referred for ip treatment. fast forward to the fall i promise i'll get to my main point soon, brevity is not my strong suit : i was on a waiting list for ip, and still sick from long covid. i ran out of leave time at my job and got fired. i was already super depressed before getting fired, because my symptoms rendered me pretty much housebound. i became even more sedentary, and gained back all the weight i had lost in about the same amount of time it took to lose it. because of the weight gain, i was taken off the ip waiting list, which was super invalidating, but looking back i'm glad i didn't go to treatment. fast forward to a month ago: i caught covid a second time. a lot of my gi issues had gotten better by this point, and luckily they haven't flared up again yet. but this time around, i am struggling with pem post exertion malaise , meaning that even a small amount of physical activity or socializing can wipe me out for days afterwards. i went running twice this week, and the day after that, i had chest and muscle pain, shortness of breath, couldn't get off the couch, and heavy brain fog. before i went running that first day, i noticed that my fitbit felt a little tight on my wrist...and realized that it no longer fits comfortably like it used to without adjusting the strap one notch. it is heartbreaking and humiliating. i'm not trying to become underweight again, but my body has deconditioned so much over the past year that i would like to start exercising again also to help with depression . but if exercising means that i fuck myself over for days afterwards...what am i supposed to do? i'm sick of being sick. i'm sick of feeling fat and lazy. i'm sick of being disgusted with my body, but not being able to do anything about it. sorry this got so long. if you made it to the end, thank you so much for reading. i just really had to vent.",

"3 years old and just feeling lost. i ve struggled with an eating disorder for 1 years now. my abusive ex partner acted as the catalyst. it was my way of coping with the abuse and his frequent comments about how perfect i would be if i just lost 1 lbs would be absorbed. i tried treatment in the past and failed because i couldn t cope with having to gain weight especially because i wasn t even underweight at this point. i did okay for a few years definitely not recovered by any means, but i was restricting far less and i stopped my lax abuse, though i totally fucked my digestive system up because of my ed. but it would still creep in here and there subtle. refusing to eat at gatherings, incessant calorie counting, eating only one meal per day, etc. it started rearing its ugly head again intensely once i convinced myself i had to look a certain way for my wedding and the all consuming thoughts resurfaced once again. prior to that, i maintained a healthy weight and convinced myself it was okay. but the reality is i m really only comfortable in a small body. i turned 3 recently and i believe that is what precipitated my relapse. i feel like a false adult so to speak. i suck at being an adult and i just want to get lost in my eating disorder. how society mainly men have always perpetuated the need for women to look a certain way really fucked my head up. i am seeing laugh lines and fine lines on my forehead and i just can t cope. i am terrified of getting older. and i just overall feel like i m generally failing at life. i m using my ed as a crutch. i want to go back to that childlike sense of innocence that i frankly never was able to experience due to childhood trauma and a mother who also has an eating disorder, but i didn t realize it until a few years ago when i finally started putting the pieces together. i read an article that stated that one of the seductions of anorexia is that it is an anesthetic and that s exactly why i think i keep doing this. it makes me feel numb to life and it doesn t leave room for fear and dark thoughts that inevitably creep in. but it doesn t leave room for anything at all, really. my performance at my job is starting to be affected since my relapse. i m afraid it is only a matter of time before my marriage is affected as well. my incredibly kind and loving husband doesn t know i have relapsed. my ed can t risk being forced away again. in fact, he is out right now at a sporting event so i m taking advantage of his time away and just frantically pacing in my kitchen to burn more calories and increase my deficit after having already ran 6 miles today. and how many nights i have gone to bed so early because i just can t cope with the extreme hunger anymore. but i am just so focused on getting physically smaller, that everything in my life is getting so much smaller as a result. i can t stop and honestly, i don t want to stop. i find a sort of comfort in this darkness because it is all i have ever known. i know it will always be here when life goes to shit. it s a constant in my life.",

"how do you go to treatment if you don t meet every diagnostic criteria?. this is a long one but i think i need help. the last few years i ve been struggling with disordered eating but people close to me say that i m fine. i feel lost and know i m not healthy but not sick enough. i m 27, 5 8, and weigh 97 pounds. i am shaky glad i m not a doctor because my hands shake horrendously , always cold, my nails break like crazy and i shed like a golden retriever. i know i am not fat and i don t think i am. i m nervous and anxious at the thought of gaining weight and looking visibly larger than i always have looked. i have always been underweight. stress makes me not eat or gag when i put anything in my mouth. i also don t feel hungry, and when my partner mentions that i only had a small amount of dinner it bothers me because i ate food and drink wine like normal people do. i visited a friend who was doing an inpatient stint and i weighed less than her and was freaked out. i ve been to nutritionists, have had a colonoscopy and just saw my gp for a physical last week and when i mention my concerns they ask questions to determine if i am anorexic and every time nobody says anything or that according i the dsm i am not anorexic because i don t meet the fixation on food or have body dysmorphia factors. my partner know i have some kind of disordered eating and they think i m not too sick. we have been talking about having a baby and it scares the fuck out of me. not the parenting part, but looking pregnant. i would have to go off my meds and i don t think i could mentally or emotionally deal with a baby belly and not snapping back to pre baby body. i m too afraid to know if i have a period so i haven t stopped my birth control to find out. i know being this way and not eating a lot of food can mess up fertility. i also don t want to starve a baby if i can get pregnant so i think it s time to do something about the food thing. if doctors think being this underweight is okay nobody would take me seriously in treatment l because i m not sick enough for a diagnosis of anorexia. i know how i feel about food and even gaining 5 pounds terrifies me is bad but everyone tells me i am not sick enough for help. it s making me question if i am sick or these thoughts are normal.",
at a loss. feeling alone in my struggle with an ed... i have one person i feel mildly comfortable with sharing things with...i can joke about it with my boyfriend but only 2 people and all of this subreddit know i'm struggling. i'm an adult with kids and a job and all that shit and i don't have a single friend i can rely on to understand. it's hard doing this alone. it's hard when you wanna get well but you also have this goal in my head that i won't stop until i reach it. i'm not uw so nobody really takes it serious. i'm not pretty so nobody really cares. i've been a recovering drug addict for 4 years off of pretty much anything and everything and i'm scared to fucking eat? i feel so ashamed because it's so silly to feel so horrible about myself when i push so much love and light into the world but spend so much time killing myself to be something i can never be. alot of my thinking has stemed from years of self hatred and trauma that i've done so much to rewire my thinking and it seems to get thrown away anytime i find something that i'm not okay with my partners phone or when i see someone who is drop dead gorgeous cuz i know i'd have to do so much to be like that.. sorry for the rant. like i said i have no friends at this point to share with.,

it's hard to tell if i'm anxious or hungry. something astronomically bad happened early last week and ever since then my anxiety has left me a shaking mess but they were similar shakes to the type i get from restricting so i just figured i'd eat and feel better... but the anxiety stopped me from eating. but i need food to take my anxiety medication. i've been taking it on a largely empty stomach the last few days and i know that's not good but i need to get the anxiety down first. i've been existing off peas and corn for a week. and now i can't tell if i need to eat or calm down or both and the only way to find out is to make food and potentially waste it because it was anxiety. i'm just so stressed and miserable and i just want to eat. i was going okay with food before this happened and now i'm pumping myself full of liquid calories because the only food i can eat has nothing in it. i mean at least i'm eating a vegetable? god. i'm so fucking drained. i don't wanna do this shit anymore.,

"i have covid and am struggling. i've been in quasi recovery since leaving treatment in february. i normally get gt; 15 25 lt; steps per day and eat something like gt; 16 18 lt; calories i don't strictly count them . this worked for me, i was basically maintaining my weight or losing slowly. lately the ed thoughts have taken over more and my intake was slipping a little. my dietician is not happy and wants me to consider hloc. i'm not opposed to it or anything, but unfortunately my insurance does not cover it anymore. i went on a trip with my family this past weekend and ate somewhat less then usual because my strict routine was interrupted and was exercising less though i still did gt; 4 k lt; steps over the course of the 3 day weekend . i get home and yesterday morning i found out i have fucking covid. i feel crappy. it's not the sickest i've ever been or anything, but my ed developed in the same time frame as the pandemic and so masks have protected me from having any bugs at all since pre ed. i don't know how to handle this inability to exercise and still eat. i'm worried if i eat even gt; 12 lt; calories i will gain weight. so i've been eating closer to gt; 1 lt; which is the amount that put me in the hospital the first time sustained over many months . i have my dietician appt on zoom this afternoon and last time she just made me eat gt; 6 calories lt; in session which... is not helpful. i'm worried my dietician will drop me and i'll spiral and wind up hospitalized again. i don't want to spiral back down to where i was but i'm just so terrified of weight gain. i really can't tolerate even my ""1 ibw"" let alone my actual set point which is a bit higher since i developed my ed well into adulthood i have a good idea what it is . i'm worried if i try to exercise while i have covid or in the immediate post covid period i'll increase my chances of getting long covid and not be able to exercise at all. i'm worried restricting will also hamper my body's ability to fight off the infection. i asked my doctor for a prescription for paxlovid but apparently it interacts with my meds so i can't have it. i'm also really worried that i'll lose my sense of taste and or smell permanently. so far it's muted feels far away but i still have it. even this being permanent would be devastating. the food i allow myself is one of the few pleasures i have in life. my life is shitty and i use my ed to cope with that. i really want to sleep but i can only sleep on my stomach and my congestion is too uncomfortable in that position. i've only gotten a couple hours of fitful sleep on my back side. has anyone else here survived covid with an ed and have any insight or ideas of how to cope? so far i'm just trying to stay busy with the still activities that i might not normally allow myself to do for as long like playing video games but i don't really have the energy to do it all day. yesterday i had tested positive but didn't feel sick yet so i worked on cleaning the apartment some, today that feels out of the question.",

"why am i thrilled to be back in this dark place?. i m 25 now. i feel like my ed started in a strange way. i was always a string bean growing up, but i was starting to progress like a normal child until high school when i was put on focalin 2x daily for adhd. food was repulsive to me, i didn t eat breakfast or lunch for 4 whole years of school. after school i would go ride and train horses on an empty stomach with desire for food. then when i got home in the evening i would binge on random shit in the fridge bushels of strawberries, salami, bowls of cereal . i weighed probably 85 9 lbs at 5 6 throughout highschool. looking back on it i feel like nobody cared or noticed. people always commented on me being skin and bones but it felt like they were complimenting me. when i went off to college, i decided to go off the meds for multiple reasons. my appetite was back, and i was still an athlete competitive horseback riding eventing , i didn t even seem to care what my body looked like. i didn t care what i looked like at all. i ate normally and was content. i was oblivious. then, i had a series of massive knockout concussions from riding accidents while competing at school. i had received many over the years, but has 3 in one year while training a specific horse this would be 7 total in my life and was basically forced by doctors to stop riding. i was told i could die immediately if i hit my head again. so there went my sense of self, my identity, and my exercise. i started partying more, drinking more, i became very depressed and gained weight. my highest was 12 lbs, which isn t even heavy, but it was more than i had ever had on my body. i ended up in the hospital for an attempt on my life and remember looking at myself in the mirror and thinking holy fuck you are fat. i just hated myself and wanted to crawl back into my emaciated body from highschool. i was down to 98 lbs in junior and senior year of college. they were the best years in recent memory in terms of friendships, accomplishments, etc. i was happy when i look back on it, but also consumes by this dark obsession with restricting, being hungry, and being validated for my weight. i was constantly being complimented for my weight, it was sickening but i loved it. i still thought i was fat somehow. i would obsess over my thigh gap, my waist to hip ratio, i would measure my body with a measuring tape daily .this continued until the pandemic, when i was 23. somehow my mindset changed, i think i was just burned out. i moved to another state, i got engaged, i was happy. i was eating normally. there was still a nagging voice in my head to weigh myself daily but i never did. until i went to a dr s appt in late 2 21 and realized i was 111 lbs. the horror. and now, i m consumed again. i have control again. i feel like i will kill to be back where i was in college. i hate this. why is this my life. however, it s hard on my body now. i get shaky, i get extreme stomach pain when i don t eat all day. i pass out and none of this ever used to happen to me. i m scared and want to be free, but to me being free is being in control of my weight.",

that moment you realize how little you ve been eating. yet here i am. in a normal body. not really losing weight. in order for me to lose weight now i have to eat literally 7 calories or less. this is fucking hell on earth. starving myself just to maintain my weight. just looking for support. i ve been watching tons of videos about reverse dieting. i ve tried reverse dieting with a dietitian and it only made my ed worse. there is no eating normal anymore. maybe i should just accept the fact that i will be starving myself forever and maintaining my weight. if someone normal were to eat like i ve been eating the last 2 months they would be extremely underweight by now. i m not ok today,
"damned if you do, damned if you don t.. i ve had an unusual spike in life stress recently and feel like i never have a safe controlled space to eat as i wish. basically eating enough to maintain my underweight weight, but usually i have time alone where i ll eat foods that actually satisfy me and calm down the extreme hunger that i otherwise have. eating such foods is not compatible with any normal socially accepted meal or meal time. ok, i ll come out and say it because this is getting too vague. i m eating normal because i need to survive and prevent severe binge urges. eating normal is probably under eating a little because normal feels like too much. anyway, i m so fucking hungry and all i want is graham crackers with peanut butter and nutella. or some greek yogurt and cheerios. these hit the mental and physical needs i feel. but then i think, will that really satisfy me or cause a new problem? recent life change means i m literally never alone. if i decide to indulge in these safe foods that would get my body to stop screaming for calorie dense foods, there s a chance i ll regret it and have no subtle way to purge. so apparently tonight i have dealt with this by thinking of these foods for hours, debating if i should just go for it, then thinking maybe i should hide the foods so i can eat them secretly when if the time presents itself. all this back and forth led me to just putting myself to bed to make the decision moot. and now i m thinking about how maybe i could sneak food in the middle of the night, but i don t want to take the risk of having to explain to someone what i m doing. i hate the secrecy of this disorder. i hate that so many boxes have to be checked to have a satisfying and safe eating experience. it makes me want to either go overboard or do nothing. i have never regretting not eating something in this kind of situation so i guess that is my decision tonight. i hate it here, in my life and in my brain. i want out. i hate feeling trapped.",

"i'm so tired of asking for help, over and over, and over. yesterday, for the 3rd time, my family doctor talked to me as though she were trying to convince me that i need help. ""we need to refer you to an ed clinic"" she said, and we once again filled out the same form we always fill out. each time i seem to tick off yes to more and more behaviours. she put in my height as 2 cm shorter than i actually am because i have terrible posture which, though minuscule, i am freaking out about because that will make my bmi seem higher, and it is already ""normal"" and said my current weight aloud which i didn't know because my partner hid my scale . she took my blood pressure and it was extremely high just as i had told her months ago and she said it didn't make sense if i was starving myself which i guess i'm not . she told me it would be a long wait to hear back from the clinic just as she had said 5 and 9 months ago when she never submitted the referral but in the meantime, i have to rent a 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. i feel like a failure because my bp is so damn high when it should be low if anything. she said i may have osteoporosis at this point and may not be able to have kids. last week, i called the ed clinic myself and the line was disconnected. i called the crisis line, and they hung up on me when i was transferred aside from that, i'm 2 years too old for most of the programs and groups in my area, which are only provided for those aged up to 24. i got ahold of the mental health outpatient near me and they said that there had never been referrals to any services as i had thought, but they offered me a cbt group that i will participate in. i feel that i have done a lot of reaching out, and yet i am in a worse place than i was before. my doctor seemed to be comforted by the fact that i had a therapist, but that was 1 cad for one online session a week. i ran out of money, and i had no one to hold me accountable or to support me in times of crisis. i didn't know what to do when extreme hunger took hold or when i started to put on weight. my therapist said it was important that i see a dietitian, but how could i afford that? on top of this, i also have a physical condition that requires me to wear an appliance, and as my body changes shape the appliance does not fit so i have to repeatedly visit the nurse to be re fitted only to change shape again. because i have had bowel surgery, i have a complication that causes me to get frequent bowel obstructions where i have to stop eating or switch to only fluids, and it is often triggered by eating large amounts of food. the appearance of my stomach itself is very different than women my age because of surgical scarring as well. in trying to recover with what little support i have, i feel that i have traded anorexia for np bulimia and i am so angry at myself. i feel like this will never end. i don't know how to be taken seriously. i know this is not uncommon spare the physical condition . i would love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar position.",

"sick of stupid comments. i've m3 been recovered from various restrictive eating issues for a few years now and gained a lot of weight over that time, as can be expected. i changed jobs about 6 months ago to a better but very time consuming job which led to me exercising 3 4 evenings a week to sitting at home in front of my computer, i also moved during that time. stress and lack of time led to me gaining more weight during that time. i recently had a meeting back at the office of my old job. upon seeing me, a colleague immediately commented ""how fat i got"" and how i'm obviously ""eating too much"". now, the reality is that for whatever reason its culturally accepted that males make such comments to each other and this isn't the 1st or 4th time that ife heard such comments. i'm sure none of these people meant harm, i'm just curious what they thought they were accomplishing. do they think i'm unaware how much tighter my clothes are? do they think by telling me ill immediately lose weight? there is no one on earth who likes hearing that they ""got fatter"". at best, such comments are making someone feel a little shitty and at worse they're triggering emotions that can lead to harmful actions. what the heck is wrong with people? am i the crazy one here? am i oversensitive? sigh.",
forgot to weigh myself before i left. now i don't know if i can have a starbucks drink or not : ,
"return to office amp; food vent. so, we re starting weaning into working from office now and i 32f had one of my first days back since about october today. and yeah i guess i ve lost some weight which is getting noticed. one of my chub teammates brings fucking pastries for me and my boss to eat. yeah, no. you know i don t ever eat this so why are you doing this to me now? celebrate that we re together? please no. i avoided them, but it was fucking awkward. then, i m minding my own business working away it s around 1pm. and this younger chub bitch who i ve had all of 3 conversations with since she started at the company, comes out of the kitchen from her lunch break and walks past my desk. i politely smile as we made eye contact and say hi . hi have you had lunch yet? ? umm. what???? i just reply, ahh no not yet. i just have a meeting i m prepping for for 2pm which is true but like fuck right off?? we re you bitching about me in the kitchen? are you this thick?? why would you say this. leave me alone. then later the same teammate is like, are you good for lunch? umm yeah, like when have i ever asked you for lunch? i m good son. dealing with this returning to work and food shit sucks. venting here but i mean how do you manage it?? mind your own, right?",
"how do you get over the guilt of spending money on food?. tw: restrictive diet mention ? i ve been buying my own groceries for three years now and i still can t seem to get it in my head that purchasing food is a necessary expenditure. in my kitchen i currently have only instant oatmeal, frozen vegetables, and canned tuna, and my ed refuses to buy anything i would actually enjoy because it seems gluttonous when i already have nutritious food available. so even if i m having a fuck anorexia moment and take the initiative to up my intake, nothing i have stocked looks appealing to me. sometimes i talk myself into spending actual money on food, but then i just remember how much money i would save if i didn t. how do you justify food purchases that aren t strictly necessary for survival?",
"being viewed as functional makes people a lot less concerned.. this time last year i was signed off work due to my anorexia, i barely left my house and spent all day engaging in behaviours. i had professionals on my back, demanding i go ip, sending me to a amp;e, and eventually trying to get my sectioned. health wise i was in a worse place than i am now but not by much, and i ve barely hear a peep from the professionals in my life. the only difference now is that i have a job, i go to work, i function as well as i can and from the outside i look like i m doing tons better. even my friends and family seem less concerned. it makes me feel like such a fraud sometimes especially because i have to eat more than my brain is okay with in order to maintain a level of functioning. but that still doesn t mean my health mental physical is any better. often i fantasise about quoting my job so i can focus solely on my ed. i dint know if any of this skews sense, but i m a little feed up of people assuming i m okay just because i have managed to pull myself together a little and can outwardly appear to be functioning well.",

"recovery thoughts. i feel like ""exhausting"" doesn't even begin to cover it. i'm at that sweet spot between getting back up and staying down. i want to go back up, but i don't. recovery is hard, everyone knows. but i don't think that people who doesn't go through it can comprehend or even imagine what you need to face. have you ever heard the soundwaves a black hole emits? oblivion. the thing is, that same sound has been playing in my head for so long, i'm finding comfort in it. the boundless void inside my chest. the fire's warm embrace of the hell in my mind. the crackling sound of my will to fight slipping through my finger, burning away. the crackling sound of a cigarette being smoked on a quiet summer night. i was alone in the cold, dark night. i saw what i thought was a light, but it was that flame. that tiny, frail, dark flame i knew was still burning. have you ever tried to put out an oil fire by throwing water on it? now i'm home, wrapped within her tiny iron clasps, burning my skin against her claws as i'm trying to get a grip, or maybe to get them deeper into me. because i don't know who i am without her. how easier would it be to just fall deeply into her sick and twisted fantasy. how easy would that be. like i said, exhausting doesn't even begin to cover it. and i'm just so fucking hungry .",
what to do when cortisol spikes low blood sugar anxiety. it s hard for me to even know what s what anymore. is it from fasting all day or not eating enough? is it overwhelm? is it anxiety? is it low blood sugar? i don t know what to do sometimes and all i m left with is taking a klonopin or calming supplements but it s this uneasy feeling i get at night and i have a feeling it s related to cortisol and blood sugar.,
"fucking wild how the brain on ed messes with you.. hit the two month mark of my foray into recovery and after a supportive conversation felt strong enough to weigh myself for the first time since i went to the er 3 4 months prior. i have been convinced obsessed for the past week i gained 4x the amount of logically reasonable weight i actually did. i m not like. happy about it, ofc i never will be, but i know this is a stable weight for my body to function at and to give up everything i ve gained since then to lose an insignificant amount of weight would be devastating. most importantly, i don t want to. i don t want to have to do this ever again. i hope i never relapse. i still argue with myself and struggle every day but it s miles away from the hell i endured under the control of my ed. idk i hope anyone reading this is encouraged to know that you don t have to worry about being perfect; recovery is about getting better and you deserve it.

"i'm relapsing and i don't give a shit.. or i should say i'm losing weight and i don't give a shit. whether it's a relapse depends on your pov, whether all intentional weight loss constitutes a relapse or not. i'm eating less and drinking more water and allowing myself to go bed a little bit hungry. i've added a side salad to dinner and i'm only eating one serving of dinner. being more mindful of portion sizes. if i'm unbearably hungry, i'll have a little more, other than that, too fucking bad, porkchop. i'm tired of being overweight and my idiot body's appetite keeping me there. yeah, it sucks. i'm not logging calories and i'm not starving myself, but i've done this bullshit song and dance enough time to know what a deficit feels like fatigued, hungrier, more food focused than before . tough shit, i need to lose 3 lbs. to get to a healthy weight, and the weight is coming off whether my body wants to cooperate or not. the weight's probably going to come back regardless, but i don't care. this flesh will obey me.",

"i just realized every ed food behavior i have revolves around binging now.. hi y all, sorry for posting twice in two days i don t want to spam the sub. but lately i ve realized that goddamnit, all my fucking ed shit revolves around binging. in hs when i first acquired this damn thing, everything revolves around restricting. binges were occasional and xxx cal instead of xxxx cal like they have been for me for awhile. i was obsessed with restricting and diligently tracked my every move. now, everything and i mean everything , revolves around binges. for 2.5 years until the last three months basically i binged hard every day. now that i m out of it, i m fucking terrified of binging yet i also sometimes foolishly low restrict which always triggers binges. now, my rule is to purge after every binge as a punishment. everything seems to have to do with binging now that i m older. ive binged about 1 3 times a month for three months now. it s much better than every day, but still awful and shameful to experience. was just wondering if anyone had a similar experience any advice to permanently get rid of binges?",
"does anyone else feel like now that they re, older, they re more disordered eating than eating disorder ?. hey y all. this is such a wonderful community and i m glad to have a place to speak openly amp; i wanted to ask this because it s been my experience. in high school, i had full blown anorexia. i had a million rules, constantly thought about food, thought my body looked like a space alien, etc etc. just classic ana bullshit. now that i m an adult i m 25 , it feels different somehow. i went for awhile with the ed mostly in remission, but 2.5 years ago i developed full blown bed for apparently no reason and gained an absolutely huge amount of weight in a relatively short time frame. only a few months ago, after changing to an experimental medication and starting to take vitamin d supplements, have i been out. but anyway, back to the question: now, i ve been losing weight. i ve lost xx pounds, and my eating feels definitely disordered, but not like an actual eating disorder? i purge 1 3 times a month when i end up binging, but i don t low restrict anymore, i don t snap a rubber band on my wrist every time i think about food, i only sort of hate my body but i m pretty sure i know what it looks like. idk. it doesn t feel like i have an ed though i was diagnosed with osfed by my psychiatrist , but i don t think binge purging is considered normal either. the purging is also low key getting worse not because i m binging more, but as i get distance from the huge xxxx cal binges of bed smaller and smaller amounts constitute a binge for me. it s not every day and it s certainly not 5x a day like in high school, but i have a bandaid over my right knuckles right now because evidently i ve been doing it enough that they started bleeding. i also have been keeping this behavior a secret with plans to reveal it. what do y all think? has your ed changed over time? does anyone have a similar experience?",

"no period for 9 years and no doctors care.. i developed anorexia at 13 after having one cycle. i think it came back for one or two cycles when i was 14, but it's hard to remember. since then, i haven't ever had a natural period. i have had cycles of recovery amp; relapse and regardless of my weight amp; overall health, it doesn't return. i even went to residential and was eating a lot of calories and not moving around at all. my bmi was 21.3 and i still didn't get a period. my cousin, who also has an ed, always gets her period even when her weight is super low. i don't know why that isn't the case for me. i've told every doctor i see about this. countless pcps, nurses, two gynos...none of them seem concerned. my first one noted ""probably due to hypothalamic amenorrhea"" in visit summary. my current one didn't say a thing about it. i thought they might want to test for pcos or something that could cause amenorrhea. no doctors do in depth testing for it, either. the most i've gotten is general labs thyroid panels not even for my period, specifically , which are always normal. i feel like something else is wrong since it hasn't come back regardless of my weight, stability, diet, etc. even my old dietitian was concerned and kept upping my cals amp; weight goal bc my period wasn't returning, even after i surpassed her original goals, which just triggered me into relapse. i'll also add that my family seems to be prone to heavy and painful periods. my sister and cousins all struggle with heavy bleeding, cramping, amp; mood symptoms. when i was on the mini pill, i was told that my period would likely be super light and or nonexistent. well, it was heavy amp; painful. i am not on the combo pill and i've been heavily bleeding a week before i should be with excruciating cramps though i did take plan b a while ago, so who knows . i guess this is just venting bc i can't believe no doctors seem to care about this.",
"i sometimes like to dream that there is a version of myself out there that was happy. a variant of myself that enjoyed being an engineer. allowed someone into there life, settled down, got married and lived their dreams. took holidays, attended major social events. smiled and felt content........ i spend a lot of time alone reflecting on the things that have happened and the things that might happen. the things i lost in the fire. the many opportunities i allowed pass rather then act on them. choosing rather to punish myself. resolving a sense of prolonged hope which became an agony. volunteering and helping different individuals that require support. i help, provide reassurance and then leave. providing a little less hate towards myself each day. in the dark or the light i go to work and come home to a sense of emptiness. i think my most distinct moments are when i stand at the sink. the trickle of the water reminds me of my bulimia, as i finish the remnant of my black flavorless tea the bitter taste brings me back to my anorexia. someone i helped once told me if i could cry it would help. in a way it would alleviate the aggregate. i think if i allowed myself cry i probably wouldn't stop. i haven't cried for a long time. i think it was another life time when i last cried. a time when i felt my life was fading with each restriction, period of fasting and each sleepless night. it felt like a decisiveness. i was moving to resolve outstanding concerns. it felt natural. even the violence of my bulimia seemed to book end this overwhelming sense of pain. that's where i am now. this triumphal monument to who i was, who i am, who i never got the chance to be. so i hope in another place, moment and time he got to experience love, held hands and was loved, was finally happy, dreamed without nightmares, felt the heat of the sun, the cold of the shade, allowed himself to be intimate, he enjoyed the things so many take for granted, cried and never regretted the things that were lost in the fire. forgot the broken bones, the sense of loss, the sleepless nights, the despair that turned to a sense of regret that turned to contrition. he was defined by the people he helped and loved. not his eating disorders. thank you for reading.",

its stressful how little eating is prioritized in the service industry. i'm basically a shift lead in the food service industry so it's a lot of running around all day dealing with one chaos after another. also lots of heavy boxes and things to deal with. on top of that it's an amusement park so everything is far apart so i get a crap ton of steps on busy days. but in this industry taking breaks and eating is kinda looked down apon since its a constant onslaught of guests coming. especially with how short staffed everywhere is nowadays.. i'm planning on eating more but thinking about finding time to eat a proper amount of food without being judged and causing problems is making me anxious.,
"guilt about people asking for weight loss advice.. i'm struggling with how to respond to people who are asking me for weight loss advice. for context, after years of binge eating disorder, i was in the ""class 2 obesity"" category of bmi. i fell back into restricting late last year, and i've lost a significant amount of weight, to the point that i'm starting to get a lot of comments and compliments. which blows my mind, because i still have a really long way to go and still look awful, but i digress. i've had a couple friends reach out in the last few days alone asking what my secret is and how i'm doing it. i feel so, so guilty. like i'm a huge fraud. i usually just awkwardly say thanks and mention something along the lines of counting calories, smaller portions, and moving more. none of which are technically lies. but i also just want to scream, please, for the love of god, don't do what i'm doing i am the world's worst example and you should not use me as a comparison if you're unhappy with yourself now, there is a very real chance that won't change with weight loss this is a dangerous road which of course i'd never say, because i don't want anyone to know what i'm doing or to screw up a bunch of relationships with friends and family over something i have no intention of stopping at this point. but i'm having a really hard time shaking the guilt when people ask me for advice. so how do you respond when people ask you for weight loss advice? or to compliments? or comments about your weight or body in general?",
"i really don't know what i look like anymore. mostly weight related but not exclusively. so i had an appointment to dye my hair today and i knew what i wanted but recently i was going through old selfies trying to see what colors looked best on me. i used to dye my hair a lot before 2 2 and then just stopped. but looking at all my old selfies i just kept noticing a more defined jaw and it messed me up. but i almost always use snapchat filters so it's hard to tell what i ever even look like. i don't know what my face looks like. after the appointment i took some selfies and even with the most minimal filters that improved my face overall, i felt like i still looked chubby like no definition in the jaw. so then i got all in my head like 'well i guess my face did used to look better and shine through the filters' or whatever. i'm always paranoid i'm carrying my weight gain in my face. i might be. i don't know. aside from today i barely take selfies anymore. i was looking forward to this hair appointment and these past few days have been recurring thoughts of 'what am i doing this for i have to stop eating it won't even look good because my face is too round' and i hate it. even during the appointment i just kept thinking about how i have to fix my diet and my body. didn't even clarify but i gained some 'covid weight' and i know it's not even that much but i feel like it makes me look so different, healthy eating choices don't change anything, and i hate it. i also wanted to pick up bubble tea or donuts on the way home for me and my boyfriend but instead i just went home. i'm okay overall but just wanted to vent this out.",

"triggered and scared. the last couple weeks has been way more intense with my ed. im living at home, grieving a death of a family member, so my ed has completely taken front and center. the obsession with losing fat, getting shredded , going full blown keto etc etc. not having much of an appetite and consuming hundreds of hours of content about fasting, keto, psmf. this woman that i found on youtube amp; podcasts basically looks like the epitome of an anorexic woman. but she s made it socially acceptable because she sells it as keto and psmf. she s super famous and writes cook books and has lost more than 9 lbs. she s underweight, has like zero body fat. she literally looks like the epitome of a severe anorexic over exerciser. the moment i found her i thought ed was screaming out, but i don t see comments on any of her videos or instagram which is crazy to me. she s gaunt, she can t be more than 85 lbs, she has muscle but she s also emaciated. my ed got so triggered and basically said if she can have that body and be healthy why can t i? i have way more fat on my body than her so i must be fine. i must be healthy because if she s claiming she s healthy while she s underweight and zero body fat, i must get rid of this fat on my body. i haven t been eating much at all and i don t understand how my body is functioning so now i ve been on an ocd kick and doing what she talks about that helped her and her clients lose weight. i feel trapped and stuck. on one hand, i feel like i ve made some progress with my ed because i am eating foods i didn t eat before, but on the other hand , my orthorexia has gotten worse and my daily movement has been a lot and i feel exhausted and drained. i feel torn in two directions and my body is tired : but my ed won t fucking let this go. my ed is so triggered and wants me to lose fat and look like this keto woman.",

"advice needed: blood test. hi all, hoping someone may be able to guide me on this. i will be having a blood test this week, and i am wondering if there's any particular biomarkers that i should have checked? i know this isn't really a medical sub, sorry if these kind of posts aren't allowed please delete if not appropriate context: i'm 22f, history of an since early adolescence. i have a yeast infection for three weeks, it hadn't been responding to treatment. last week, i saw the doctor, and she found that i also have a uti, as well as bacterial infections in my sinuses and ears. this comes after increasing fatigue the past 4 months, to the point where, lately, i sleep up to 18 hours of the day. my iron levels had been low, but no more than usual for me. i am a bit worried about my immune system. my doctor has mentioned before that my bone marrow may be affected by an, and i've also read that people with eds are more likely to develop thyroid problems. has anyone else had similar experiences? i'd love to hear if you have any advice or guidance.",
"i want to restrict as i used to, but i can't because i no longer hate myself. can anyone relate?. i've had an ed most of my teenage and adult years, and when i was 18 2 i restricted and got to a point where i was happy with my body's appearance for the first time in my life. anyway, back then i was fuelled by the depression and self loathing brought on by unloving parents. it was easy as fuck to restrict. i didn't even get hungry most of the time. i purely used the power of self hatred. but then... i met someone. for the first time ever i was loved unconditionally. and i started to eat properly. i've been with him for years and we are now married. i've done so much mental work and my self hatred is essentially gone. i feel loved and appreciated by family, friends and colleagues. but over lockdown my bed came back and as a result i am currently the heaviest i've ever been. and while i don't hate myself, i think i look fucking gross, i feel uncomfortable in my clothes, i want to hide away some days, and i avoid mirrors. so i've recently started weightlifting, cycling more, and eating a healthier diet and trying to control my binge urges. you know. trying to lose weight in a 'normal' way. but then... i see a candid photo of myself or i feel particularly full or bloated and the urge to restrict fast comes back. but then is immediately countered by the thought that i don't have to restrict, everyone loves me for who i am regardless, being my size is actually not the end of the world as i'm still fit and healthy ect. i don't want to miss out on nutrient rich enjoyable foods. ugh. so essentially the past few years of 'recovery' and finding people who love me regardless has ruined my ability to do ed behaviours. but the ed urge to be skinni hasn't gone away. i've been feeling shitty about this for the past 12 months tbh. the fact that i can't do my ed 'properly' as i did as a teen, coupled with the natural body changes of becoming an adult. can anyone relate? i'd really like some sympathy and understanding edit: i just said all this to my husband and had a cry while he cuddled me. and he responded that he knows it must be so hard, he sees me struggling, but he's really proud of me because my rationality shows that i am getting a better relationship with food. yes, it will take time, but the ed voice will keep on getting quieter in my head. and although it might not feel great to be heavy right now, maybe that's what it took to figure out how to have a better food relationship. so i want to echo that sentiment to all of you. i'm proud of you, because if you're in this same position it means you are letting go of your ed thoughts. it means you're becoming more rational and realising that ed is not good for you and your body. sending love ",

"today just sucks hard and i really dunno where else to rant. tw: talk about trying on clothes etc., self hatred, ""feeling""fat, mild suicidal ideation, massive self pity, that kind of crap . tw: self hate, feeling fat, suicidal ideation, periods, clothes, cars being buttheads. so...heaviest day of period, first of all, good start. feeling quite uncomfortable anyways. made a slightly snarky comment reply to someone's post on my main account because they were just shilling their own crappy subreddit which was weird as hell anyway instead of following sub rules, and someone else came back calling me names, so obviously that made me just delete my comment and move on with my life like a normal human being...and then ugly cry for an hour. started getting stuck on all the sad thoughts in the world so i thought i'd go for a walk, get some sunlight and fresh air, i needed to get out of that mindset. i wore a ""new"" top i'd modified it's an old top, i just changed some things about, plus comfy jeans, comfy jacket. felt ok in these clothes. saw my reflection quite a lot walking to the shops. suddenly not fine, but whatever right, i have shops to visit, it'll be fine... every single pair of jeans i tried on was awful. just straight up awful. nothing looked right on me. nothing fit. either too big in the wrong places because i deliberately picked up sizes two or three times too big that was all they had...so i couldn't even feel good about that , or way, way too tight, even ones in my size. or just weird shapes weirdly cut. just...i wanted some basic sodding jeans. so i felt crap. whatever. i was gonna have lunch, maybe a sandwich, but changed my mind and had coffee instead. didn't even treat myself to a cigarette because i felt like the worst piece of shit at this point and didn't deserve a treat. nearly get hit by a car on the way back. i was following the people ahead of me at the crossing like the mindless dolt i apparently am, but i guess the light wasn't green, and a car came round the corner. i stepped back and would've been fine but the bastard driver honked at me and it freaked me out so bad i fell over on my arse. i scraped my elbow, twisted my ankle and donked my legs on the concrete, but didn't feel that til later. don't fucking honk at pedestrians...i was out of the way by that point anyway. so obviously i then cried all the way into tesco and all the way home. i felt like if i wasn't the fat gross one at the back of the pack of people, i'd have made it across the crossing before any car showed up. if i hadn't been so fat, i wouldn't have fallen over. if i hadn't been so fat, i'd be more hurt from falling over because my giant butt wouldn't have padded my fall and i'd be injured ""properly"" i mean...never mind the fact that i'm actually in some pain. that pain is just because my fat body is so fat that it got injured by falling a couple of feet. hey, who said i'm rational right now... . a very nice lady saw the whole thing and asked if i wanted to sit with her and slagged off the car driver for honking instead of just braking or just keeping on driving...since i wasn't in the way... but i just politely declined because i'm too shit to deserve compassion. and my chest hurts for no fucking reason on the right hand side, in the boob area, so probably period related and i hate it. i wish the stupid car had crushed me but i'd probably do more damage to it with my awful body anyway. i know this is stupid and irrational. i know my mind's catastrophising and black and whiting everything, i know it's not reasonable, etc. i just feel super crap today and i wanna just go to sleep but i can't because i had coffee for lunch and a fucking white monster as an afternoon snack because i have to have dinner with my bf later and pretend that all is well today. i'm so tired and it's all really dumb and it's probably more amusing than anything else but i just wish i was back at my worst so i could dissociate and remove myself from this mess a bit.",

"metabolism is broken. i am just really having a hard time. i have extreme orthorexia due to my auto immune and thyroid conditions. hashimotos and pcos as well i have a long list of foods i m allergic to and sensitive to, but that doesn t bother me as much as the metabolism thing. i am in no way eating at a surplus or even at maintenance but i still somehow am maintaining or gaining. it makes recovery not feel possible for me because if i change the way i eat even the slightest, i will gain weight rapidly. i feel like my metabolism is permanently broken. i look at my body, specifically my legs and i get infuriated. how are my legs this fat still? how am i fat still when i eat the way i do? this is fucking nuts. the way i m eating is not normal and anyone else eating the way i do would be emaciated by now, but here i am, looking normal. i guess i wouldn t care about the way i eat it i was actually super skinny or underweight but i m not, so i feel like shit emotionally and the ed just gets worse and worse and i continue to maintain my weight. just here for support, not looking to be told i need to gain weight, it s my body, not yours.",
"messiness of recovery just makes me miss restriction. the hardest part of recovery for me is that all i experience is short term negatives and i can never seem to push through to normal life since i just jump into another way to restrict or purge. not true for everyone but the feeling of control, precision is definitely something i savor about restriction. recovery however is always so messy. every time i try to recover, the messiness of bloating, edema, stretch marks, losing control just drives me back to restriction. i m also one of those ladies whose features only look good when i restrict anyways so the puffiness of recovery is so depressing. i resent this so much that i must restrict to look just ok.",

"at my longest streak without purging since november 2 13. i feel embarrassed saying that, almost 9 years and probably at least half of that was every day. i gave it up for lent, and while i have done that successfully a few times before, in the past i always have stayed up until midnight on easter morning to binge and purge as soon as the fasting period was over. so i m now at 46 days and 2 hours, not very long in the grand scheme of things but it s long for me. i m quite full because i ve been very strict for the rest of lent in what i was eating so i wouldn t be set off to binge, felt extremely depleted and wanted to give myself a real test of overeating and eating trigger foods without binging and purging. the desire to purge is certainly there but for once i feel pretty confident that i won t. i m really ready to be past that phase in my life, i started when i was 16 and i m 25 now. earlier in the year i started having agonizing chest pains, nearly constant heart palpitations, extreme brain fog and i often fell asleep randomly without warning, my dentist said my gums were eroding so rapidly that if i don t stop i ll lose all my teeth before i m 35. the first 3 have completely ceased since i stopped and my teeth don t hurt anymore. i need to make an appointment with a gp to assess long term damage, as i haven t been to a doctor since i was in ip 8 years ago. i was considering making an appointment with a therapist to deal with my anxiety since i have not been to one in 6 years. my boyfriend and i have been talking about getting married and starting a family, and the idea of doing that while i m still battling this addiction terrifies me. i also have a career to look after, and i m increasingly getting more responsibilities added where people depend on me so i can t be so brain dead anymore. this is long and disorganized, i m full of good food, a bit drunk, super happy, and i don t really have anyone i can share this success with who will actually get it. thanks for being a great community : ",
"an ode to my body. i ve never been here before. this new home of mine. adjusting to new acquisitions. hopefully will grow on me with time. after years of suppression. depression. i regret, my confession is that i miss it. i miss my old home. hallow and cold. never settled, mistaken for 12 years old. no fat to fold. but that home became worn down. falling apart at the door hinges, unlivable conditions. i had to find new shelter. recognize i deserve better. my family deserves better. to not worry about whether or not that was how i d live forever. so i renovated, revamped and remodeled, painstakingly. unrecognizable, coddled. i can feel the rays of sun beaming in through the window which i once was too numb to even appreciate their glow. i have days when i resent the way things aren t as they were, but the peace i ve found overwhelms it. i m slowly becoming sure. i don t know if i ll ever love this place, but i do love the space it gives me, to grow, to do, to love, to laugh, and to finally feel kind of free.",
"a part of me will always be bitter towards those who received help under 18. edit: i feel some are misunderstanding my post, even though you mean well i in no way think me getting help younger or that getting help underage means you'll recover. im not that naive. im saying it would've been nice to have someone who noticed or someone who cared enough to even want me to get help. not that it even matters in my case because my parents would've never obviously recognized an eating disorder though my mom no doubt has one and we were dirt poor so it's not like i could've gotten help anyway and even if i could've, they wouldn't have sent me to get help my bff and i developed ours together basically and i'd spend every weekend and summer with her and her family knew we didn't eat and that we exercised 4 hours a day, but they were diet obsessed not the no junk food kind, the diets will solve my life kind but never did and would let us have their diet pills when we asked idk i just can't imagine having family that would care enough to notice or be rich enough to do something or even know what an ed is. i loved my parents, but we rarely spent time together so it was so easy to hide idk. i know some of you did get help as kids, but im just saying the chances of recovery only a few years in is so much higher. and maybe it would've made me feel important",
"can't sleep, kind of a stream of consciousness. i've been dealing with my ed on and off for 13 years now. i've thought i was in recovery for 3.5 4 years and while i was trying to sleep tonight i realized i wasn't really recovering until about 2 years ago. i'm not going into details about the worst of it since i don't want to possibly trigger anyone who might read this, but i just need to organize my thoughts if that makes sense. i worked at a turtle farm for pets not food a few years back. i was excited about work, it kept me active and so busy that i couldn't think about anything that wasn't work. i loved it in the beginning. i thought i was through the thick of it and seeing the other side, but looking back i was still skipping lunches a majority of the time. i was having trouble keeping up with the work and the brain fog was awful. my anxiety was through the roof and i had quickly ruined my life. that i can't blame om the ed but it feels related. i got a better paying job at an animal shelter and my now ex boss told me he thought i was on drugs because of my size and at times my inability to retain information. when i worked at the shelter i was open about my ed, thinking since i'm actively recovering keeping myself accountable through them would help me. it actually did help a lot. i made a lot of friends there and looked forward to eating with my coworkers, which was huge i have a much better relationship with food now compared to then, although i still get brain fog if i have a late lunch. now that i'm thinking clearly i can remember all the times i was in a daze at a grocery store thinking i was just overworked or tired. that may have contributed, but i think it's more to do with my lack of nourishment. i know i'm going to keep having these revelations for years, and one day i might look back and think about how far i've come. i'm honestly scared to think of what permanent damage i might have caused myself now that i know i want to stick around past 3 . sorry for rambling, i figured you guys might relate to this. and waking my bf at midnight to talk about this seems kind of messed up. edit: rephrased a small part.",

""so anyone diagnosed with this illness that needs a higher level of care than outpatient they are required to go out of state. that is their only option."" how sad and disappointing is this? on top of that, i have medicaid. as much of the state does as we are poor and rural. there is no help for people with my insurance. in 2 18, i was gonna go residential. i had to call every. single. center in the united states i am not exaggerating. i truly did and only 2 were willing to accept kentucky out of state medicaid. it's not like it was easy either. i had to get a case worker and they had to communicate. it was pretty quick, but hard. i couldn't go because i couldn't afford transportation. people like me poor are forced to suffer. there is no help for us. why isn't there more treatment options across the country? even just ed specialists especially with how common and deadly these diseases are why are people in the medical field still only taught about 2 mins worth of ed content? it's distressing and disheartening. article: https: www.wdrb.com news kentucky health providers call for insurance changes for eating disorder treatment article 1d1a15a 41b1 11ec b1af db9d483adcd8.html",

"given an ultimatum by my dietitian with no preparation, and i m terrified i ll fail, and lose her support, which i really need. details below.. potential tw: no specific weight numbers, but general discussion of weight and weight restoration. i ll try to make this as easy to understand as i can. context: i m mid 3 s, an for 2 years, major relapse a year ago. i ve been working with a recovery life coach and dietitian on an outpatient basis, although everyone says i need a higher level of care. i don t disagree, but i have many legitimate reasons chronic illness, medical devices, among others i cannot go to treatment and have actually been told by more than one they couldn t accept me due to the above. we have tried every possible route, and they are not possible. so while we all see the need, we re also realistic about my options, which are limited and only include outpatient care right now. we were even starting to take a harm eduction approach in the context of treating my case as se an se ed severe and enduring an ed , from a maintenance perspective, and i was following the agreed upon maintenance terms. then yesterday, my dietitian randomly gave me an ultimatum that includes significant weight restoration something i ve been unable to do on my own, despite trying, the last few months , and if i don t reach those goals, she can t ethically keep working with me on an outpatient basis. i m just scared. i was dropped by my therapist with no warning and no explanation several months ago literally daily still dealing with the grief and trauma of that , and have been turned away from so many others i ve contacted due to my precarious physical state, but going somewhere is not an option, and i don t know how in the world i m going to meet this nutritional rehabilitation weight restoration as if it magically became doable. not having a therapist is why i m in such a low spot; because no one is helping me figure out how to access hope and anything other than apathy, and i m not saying it s anyone else s responsibility, but my therapist s actions were 1 the straw that broke the camel s back and left me feeling abandoned with absolutely no hope or reason to care about myself or recovery at all. i love my dietitian. if i lose her, i lose my coach. if i lose my coach, to be honest, i ll probably end up losing my life, because these past months without the support of someone helping me get at the root issues has proven i can t do it on my own i spend all day, every day trying to figure it out in my own, and it s just super obvious i need guidance in that area to move forward . i m not absolving myself of the responsibility of taking action. i know we ultimately eventually have to find a way to do the things despite the paralyzing fear that makes us want to run away and never deal with anything ever again. but i m also in a place where i ve been unable to do anything but barely tread water and maintain status quo since the therapist trauma happened, and i m just terrified i m going to fail and lose the support system who has thus far actually stuck with me. i don t want to die i just don t know how to live or how to do this. i m sorry, i just really needed to get that out. not looking for any specific response, and i ll ask you, if it s okay, to please not go any tough love direction with this. i know the reality, i now the truth, and after yesterday s blindside in the name of tough love i had a full blown autistic meltdown and then shutdown for several hours. i appreciate the intention, but i m too fragile to hear it this morning. especially since it s supposed to have my first thing on my meal plan in the next half hour and i m freaking out. update well, for dropped by my dietitian after committing to all of the above, and actually finally caring about this for the first time in 2 22. which means my coach is gone, too, and my sessions with her are the only reasons i ve been able to stay alive this year. this is going to break me the pain of constant abandonment and losing people i trust because i can t get the level of care i need is a pain i cannot keep living through. not an unalive ideation thing, i just think this pain of abandonment is more than i can handle.

"handling body comments body shame . i live in a colder weather climate and basically for 3 seasons of the year i can wear long sleeves and cover up to hide my body. every year when i transition to short sleeves because the heat just gets unbearable, i get comments of the nature i knew you were skinny but not that skinny my body is none of their business and i am past being triggered by people s comments because my body is not up for debate. but i do end up feeling a lot of shame whenever people can see parts of my body un covered. my body is what it is. right now the weather is changing to that point where i m gonna have to reduce my clothes layering especially at work. i m putting it off as long as possible. i guess, anyone have any advice for feeling less self conscious about my body?",

"can being underweight affect your career?. i'm 22 and i'm going to start work after i graduate. the only job i've had so far is an internship position for a company in another country. they've only ever seen my face, and while i do look much younger than i actually am, my work was good enough to carry me through. however, in person, i look very significantly underweight. a lot of people find it difficult to believe how old i am and are even more shocked to find out where i'm going to work, because it's a good role in a good company and i look too childish and therefore incompetent. i'm terrified about not being taken seriously or being mocked. the hiring process was all online but i'll probably have to go to work physically. if that happens, i'll also have to eat in front of my colleagues, but i'll worry about that later. while i'd like to know what it's like irrespective of the country, i'd like to hear from indians especially, as i'm indian and our society can be extremely judgmental when you don't look 'normal'.",
"transitioning from eating to non eating activities. anyone else have trouble with the transition from eating to doing something else? for example, i sit down to eat lunch and just want to keep finding things to eat. i always sit at a table to eat, and really avoid distractions while eating. i think it s an avoidance habit. especially at work it can be hard because obviously i usually would rather not transition back from lunch break to work. this is also a problem at home. i ve started drinking hot beverages like coffee or tea at the end of meals and that helps to transitioning me out of the meal and into the next activity. i tend to be very on the go historically, very restless and never liked to sit down for meals but now that i m sitting down at meal times it is hard to go back to other activities. i m not sure what it is i m avoiding all the time, or if i still have the ingrained scarcity mindset working against me. in other news, it s crazy how much ed behaviors can morph and change over time. i used to rush through meals to get them over with and now it s like i want to draw it out as long as possible.",

"after about 6 months, i relapsed on laxatives. laxatives aren t normally my thing, i restrict to normally about 8 calories a day and fast 2 hours a day with a 4 hour eating window. today i broke that. i ate 5 chunks of cookie dough those pre made ones that are already separated and whatnot and i panicked. i started having a full blown panic attack and rushed to my kitchen before i knew it and downed a fuck ton. it tastes fucking horrendous and that alone is shocking that it doesn t make me vomit. i feel so ashamed of myself, not only for my binge, but for taking laxatives again. i hate how it tastes, how it makes me feel, and i know that my body will have already absorbed the calories and sugar before i get it all out so i don t know why i did it. i ve been in recovery since early 2 2 , with only small blips of slip ups, but this year i ve been inching further and further towards a total relapse. after fucking up by using laxatives, i guess it s safe to say that i m relapsing. i am too ashamed to tell anyone. i stopped seeing an ed therapist about a year ago because i was in a pretty good place, and i m worried that if i admit to a therapist that i m struggling, it ll make everything worse. if anyone has made it to the end of this, thank you for listening to me. i finally thought that i had this under control, that it was behind me. i guess i was wrong.",
"after 11 years my ed is retreating and the solution has nothing to do with eating habits.. for 11 years now i've been hyperfocused on the battle of controlling my eating habits to lose weight and the loss of control that comes with binging. but i've started to realize that focusing solely on this dichotomy is 1 just fighting symptoms and not the root cause 2 it's a battle you can only lose. because life circumstances won't ever allow you to have 1 control all the time. so now, i've started fixing my life outside of the ed. all the things i've neglected in order to achieve weight loss. and the ed has in consequence not gone out of control but quite the opposite, the voice is getting quieter and quieter. my theory is that if you live in chaos, the ed functions as a coping mechanism, because it creates a small world that you are in full control of and in which you know all consequences of your actions. it's a distraction and a form of procrastination from things that actually matter. those things for me have been regular sleep, having an active social life, reducing work stress, getting rid of negative people, getting my doctors visits in, fixing bad blood work, getting sufficient micronutrients, reducing caffeine, reducing alcohol and taking care of my appearance. so for me fixing the ed from the inside has never worked, but approaching it holistically and managing outside factors has been working well.",

"just wanting too share my improvement with someone : . idk what im really meaning too say with this post, but since about mid feb ive been actively getting better and embracing it this time instead of scrambling too feel in control amp; like im deeply engaged in my ed. beginning too eat consistently, ive been trying let go of that feeling of urgency that i needed too get back into a mindset amp; routine that enabled amp; fuelled my ed instead just allowing myself too engage in nourishing myself properly and rly meaning it with no plan or end goal too make up or relapse. i dont know how well im explaining this lol but oh well ofc in the past month or so there have been slip ups amp; its all far from consistent. i think i still havent realised how many disordered thoughts r still lingering and whilst that comforts me i am now in a place where i can identify that its my ed that wants and clings too them thoughts and i myself can make the decision too tackle them or listen too them. being able too distinguish what i think vs what my ed thinks now is crazy actually quite proud of myself ahh i feel like im embracing 'recovery'? word creeps me out lol cause it feels too official and final but whatever too fast sometimes or not doing it right. almost wishing it felt harder or im not struggling enough. but then i think abt the 4 months or so before when i knew part of me desperately wanted too get better and i was fiercely pushing it away and fighting it off with fuelling my ed further cause i was just so scared. i kinda consider that period that id wanted amp; was ready too recover for longer than i thought. and theres no such thing as too quick: honestly just taking it day by day lol i could wake up and completely change my mind tomorrow but at least ive seen what recov can bring and how good it can feel: i think im just writing this too acknowledge how far ive come myself. no one in my family knows abt my ed in the first place amp; i think my friends just think im still engaging in it. i've thought abt telling my best friend how things have changed recently but thats scary and feels like ive gotta commit too it then oh well getting of track lol just wanted too come ok there and share with someone. i know reddit has been so helpful to me in the past and i hope all of you struggling can find peace in yourselves soon and allow yourself too get better too ",
"do normal people fixate on cravings?. today, all day long, the only thing i could think about was a rainbow sherbert milkshake from baskin robins. all. day. long. daydreaming about it in great detail. rationalizing reasons to get it. looking at pictures of milkshakes on google. and it got me thinking do normal people fixate on cravings like this? because for me, i'm laying in bed now that the days over and i can still only think of how badly i want the milkshake. but even if i had gotten it, i would have just felt guilty afterwards. hell, probably would have felt guilty after the first couple sips. and then i'd feel guilty for binging on the milkshake and berate myself for the rest of the day for not having enough self control to not buy the milkshake. even back in the height of bed, though, the cravings were still all consuming. the only difference was i'd immediately give in to them, then feel guilty, hate myself, and move on to the next craving. do normal people just think, ""oh, i'll have to get a milkshake soon,"" and then not constantly think of the milkshake? or like buy and drink a milkshake, enjoy it, and just go about their day afterwards? because i genuinely can't comprehend that. i hate the amount of time my brain spends wastes just thinking about food.",

i have good news everyone.. a while back i posted a vent about my failing body and heart issues. i finally went to my doctor and discussed a lot of things. my blood work was mostly fine heart sounds were good i guess lmao so she recommended i do low fodmap foods for a while to reduce pain and bloating when eating. i have to honestly say i m feeling really good most days. much less pain than in a long time and it looks like i genuinely may be unable to digest wheat which was causing massive bloating which triggered some bad behaviors. it also feels like having a real working plan helped me along mentally as well. another huge thing is that my hair is finally growing back i ve never been so happy to have that halo of baby hairs. i ll never complain about them again that s my update. i haven t been active on this account much and don t plan to be so i can continue progressing. best of luck to you all,
"feeling immature for having an ed?. i feel like a lot of people only talk about eds in teens, and make adults feel like they should be ""grown out of it"" or something like it magically goes away when you turn 18? i've had family members tell me i'm getting ""too old"" for my ed and it's really irritating and invalidating imo. idk if anyone has any advice for this, or if anyone else experiences this. should i be growing out of it? is this something that i'm immature for?",

"cannot get my mind around people thinking it s okay to comment on weight, especially in professional settings.. i have posted before about problems i had with a colleague repeatedly commenting on my size and weight. in the end i managed to speak with them and it has stopped; their comments were never said harshly, they were just inappropriate, uncomfortable and at times dark, but never with a truly unkind, judgemental tone. this week, different colleagues have become involved, but one was rough. while i was about to put on a pair of gloves in the lab, sleeves rolled up, one glared at me and said can you gain some bloody weight? with such a cold tone of disgust. i was pretty taken aback and froze for a second, then put on my gloves and started doing what i was going to do. she said you can have some of mine and laughed. i half smiled and kept working. the other colleague said i know how you can gain weight at lunch time, there s going to be cake in the staff room. come up and have some and then talked about how much they d give me. i changed the topic to work. my work bestie turned up shortly after and we went for a walk, coffee and bought food for lunch later. this one has really hurt me tbh. with my other colleague it was mostly uncomfortable but this one, the way it was said, the expression firstly, how do people think these comments are acceptable? like if someone particularly an adult is so thin you think this about them, maybe there is something unhealthy going on it s not natural by my age to be thin enough to cause this reaction. also, if it was natural, still don t be rude. also, don t shame people for how they are existing in their body fuck.",

"i relapsed.. but into purging this time, so that's a fun twist, usually i'm more of a restriction type of person. first i read a book that i didn't realize had a main character with bulimia until it was too late and it was supposedly about recovering but it went into so much detail about how the main character purged that the author may as well have written a how to guide. but i managed to finish the book without getting triggered, and the ending was really great and hopeful. but then the day after i'd finished reading that book, my ex messaged me pretty much out of nowhere to tell me his life is better without me in it and to whine about how bad i broke his heart, and to call me an asshole, to basically tell me i'm a toxic person, and in the middle of that text fight i shoved my fingers down my throat and threw up my lunch. that was about a week ago and every day since i've purged. aside from the ex drama, i've been going through a lot with my family my sister relapsed into addiction, and her hypochondria has been repeatedly landing her in the hospital and i keep getting dragged into that situation against my will , and i'm also in university full time and working two jobs, and i've just been under an insane amount of pressure from every angle. purging gives me a sense of control when it feels like everything else is crumbling and it gives me this completely fucked up sense of pride to see my food come up undigested. there hasn't really been any bingeing, i'm mostly just purging regular portions of food, and i don't know how to stop now that it's so easy for me. i know this is disgusting and unhealthy and i know it could fuck up my perfect teeth that my dad spent a fortune on i had braces for six years as a teen and one of my jobs is at a daycare and of course nobody knows about my ed there but i feel like i'm setting a horrible example for my kiddos just by working with them during the day and puking up my food at night. i know i should get help. i'm just not ready to tell anyone what's been going on especially since criteria for diagnosis requires it to be an ongoing problem and i worry that i couldn't get help without it going on for longer . and i guess this just seemed like a safe space to get things off my chest??",

"advice for a mom of teen with e.d.. hi there, a little background, my son was diagnosed in dec. of 2 2 with anorexia. in january of this year he was released from the medical clinic at the local children's hospital as he has gained enough weight etc, he is still in therapy, and i want him to continue the therapy... the problem is, i am not sure this therapist is doing anything. we've been seeing her for over a year every 2 weeks over zoom for the most part, the last two months i've stretched them to every 3 weeks because the appointments have been mostly me sitting there, giving her the rundown on how things have gone. sometimes we would fight and she would help diffuse and such, but largely, her head is down and she looks like she is working on something and occasionally goes ""mm hmmm"" ... today i decided to force the issue and said i had something due at work, and i had my son sit with the laptop directly ... there were many long pauses and she finally cut the appt short after 25 mins. my son is 15 and resistant to therapy. he isn't rude, but he's not super chatty... she didn't really even try. admittedly, my experience with therapy is limited, but i feel like she should be directing the discussion to a point. usually, i feel like i am running the appt and it's not a position i want to be in. i'd love any thoughts or advice. thank you in advance.",

"my first time here, also my first time finally acknowledging that i probably have an ed. hey, i'm posting here primarily to get some advice non medical and secondly to sense check my own thoughts. does it fall under the umbrella of an ed? my old therapist and google seems to think so. some background: i'm 31 and male, i've had what i'm coming to realise might be an ed since i was about 18 19. i've given it several, less harsh names over the years such as ""being a foodie"" or ""not having a good relationship with food"" or even just ""having a big appetite"". basically this was all so that i could avoid acknowledging that this is more than likely some kind of ed linked to binge eating. most people i know wouldn't think i had one because most of the time i only let myself see people when i'm in pretty good shape. the rest of the time though i've put on a lot of weight again and therefore hide myself away, so to them it's out of sight out of mind. to me it's constantly balancing between food hell and purgatory. i've basically yo yo'd the same 15 25kg in bodyweight a great deal of times about 2 3 times a year since i was 18. my ""routine"" is basically as follows: i'll spend about 4 months punishing myself with gruelling exercise and low calorie targets 11 14 cals a day and restrict myself to only super ""clean"" food. this 4month ish period is punctuated with weak moments where i'll spend a day or two binge eating, i'll clock in at about 13 16, cals a day i can eat a lot . once i've achieved my desired weight look i then maintain for about a month and then fall off the wagon by spending the next 1 2 months in what feels like a hole of binge eating, i'll take in about 8, cals or more a day. every single day i'll try to ""get back on the wagon again"" and get super motivated, to which i will then go into what i can only describe as autopilot and binge eat for half a day and then despise myself and regret it once it's over. after about a month or two of this i've put all the weight back on, and i get to my ""enough is enough"" weight and start all over again. rinse and repeat. it's exhausting and it's slowly ruining my life. since reaching 3 i've slowly but surely tried to confront myself that this is a serious problem. it has made me hate a good chunk of the past 13 years. the consequences of having it has cost me relationships and friendships due to spouts of super low confidence and sneak eating. so that's my background. i'm posting this partly to share my experience but mainly to get general advice and ideas of next steps once you've made the initial leap of acknowledging there might be a problem. thanks all ",

"so.....i left my job of 14 years amp; have chosen to leave behind engineering a as career after 17 years engineering was not something i wanted to do in life . i think engineering was the underlining cause of enabling and escalating my journey from anorexia to bulimia and finally drunkorexia...... hi i am sean....seanie to some, thank you for taking the time to read my post. i just needed to say this out loud......here goes, they say the lark sings the sweetest song while free but in the contrast of captivity it refuses to sing, preferring to watch its own life slip away. as long as i can remember i had an eating disorder in some shape or form. binge eating as a child, anorexia as a teenager and during my twenties, bulimia in my early thirties and drunkorexia in the second half of my thirties. when i look back now allowing myself not to obstruct my vision. i can identify my twenty first year as the moment when my eating disorder became unmanageable. which was also when i joined the world of engineering. those 17 years i like to think resemble an inferno and all the items and moments personal to me were the things consumed by those flames. i never thought i would live long enough due to my own intentions to be a engineer of 17 years. unlike my colleagues i won't speak about the awards i won or the projects i will be remembered by. if anyone wants to ask, i will answer truthfully and without any prejudice to my own detriment. though i would prefer everyone lets this period of my vocation pass like a saga which has long escaped from the storytellers vocabulary. i will remember the restricting, the fasting, the cold, the shaking, the never ending hunger, the unquenchable thirst, the pride amp; sorrow of the scales, the loss of friends, the absence of memories, truth, trust and finally the lost potential. it has been over two weeks since i fixed my face and affirmed my actions. i felt it apt to write these words as a requiem to my time long past and now consign these memories to posterity. now finally i can feel the direction of the wind has changed from easterly to westerly. i am no longer shaking. le b s, maireann an briseadh cro nach leigheasfadh inne, le gr , maireann na cuimhn nach ghoidfeadh inne, oiche mhaith mo chairde.",

addicted too feeling of loosing weight quick. dae go through month s long phases of either straight up binging overeating and gaining back the weight they lost not rly caring abt the weight gain just so they can see how much quick they can loose it again. i feel like the reason gaining doesnt bother me when im in these phases is because i just think 'ig the higher i get now the bigger the weight loss will look'. like i know what ive gained the past month or so its not that noticeable too others i think amp; ik i look healthier and like theres actual blood in me now lol but i feel like im just addicted too the feeling of starting from beginning again and getting sucked back into the restriction world as quick and violently as possible. idk how too explain. ik i feel differently when im engaging in it and i forget how tired and low energy you feel esp the first few days. but ive been thinking this for a while now. it just feels addicting is this a common feeling among ed people? edit just too expand i do go though times of b p etc too when the weight fluctuation upsets me enormously as it usually would. but w this i mean more when you have the mindset of 'not caring' as such because youll have more too loose when the desire ability too restrict comes around again yk ,

"rant i relapsed at the worst time and it kind of scares me. i was actually doing well with my recovery. ed wasn t haunting me every second. but that might be because my brain tumor was taking over and didn t let me think and gave me too much brain fog and forgetfulness. i got my brain tumor removed in december. diagnosed with brain cancer then too. now that i am in treatment for it, doing nightly radiation and chemo, i am back where i was. my bf keeps an eye on me, but i ve been so sick lately that it s free restriction and purging despite being a recovered bulimic for 1 years but for whatever reason i m not complaining . i m told to eat 6x a day but i literally can t and i am back to all of my old ways. it helps with the hair loss and how stupid it all is. but of course i know how stupid and dangerous this is. they re helping one problem, yes, but my other main one is worse. my oncology team asks about my eating and anorexia weekly, but i lie and tell them the dinner my bf is cooking that night. it feels like shit as they watch the scale drop drastically and as i hear my bf s concern because he s tired of me doing this to myself. i just feel like i m really fucking up here. i m definitely not doing anything to help myself. this disease is so damn tiring. both of them. i just want to go through my day without thinking of good and my body and all the things that go along with it 24 7. it s just so silly.",

"weight gain from medicine triggering me after years of recovery. i have a really painful disease called endometriosis and i m on birth control to manage it. the birth control has made me go up by 5 dress sizes, i don t fit any of my clothes anymore. i ve been watching what i eat as much as i can without relapsing and i still keep gaining. the disease also makes it really hard to exercise due to pain. honestly i m really proud of myself for not relapsing sooner throughout this experience, so far i ve been able to tell myself that pain is worse than weight gain and just accept it, but today something snapped inside of me and i think i m about to completely relapse in restrictive eating. i couldn t find anything in my wardrobe that fits for a work meeting, and had to literally go out and buy new clothes for the meeting. i just stood in change rooms crying. i don t want to stop the medication because i don t want to be in pain anymore, but i m afraid if i don t stop the medication i m going to fall deeply back into anorexia. thanks for listening to my rant",
"so tired of this... just need to rant a little because i'm so annoyed with my ed. i recovered for almost 2 years and then it came back and i'm just sick of this mindset i can never be completely comfortable in my relationships because i hate being in my own skin so much with how big i am, i didn't realize how bad i had gotten until i was visiting my grandmother at the hospital and panicked because i had unscheduled food so i went and did a bodycheck in the bathroom....my dying grandmother's hospital bathroom...because i was worried about some trivial meal that i wasn't prepared for. it's ridiculous. i use my bf's house as an enabler for my ed because he has a scale so i can weigh myself as often as i want since i got rid of my scale at home when i was recovering. sorry, not sure if this is allowed and it's kind of a stupid rant, but i'm realizing how much i let it run my life and i'm so annoyed at myself.

"eds vs disordered eating. too simplify it verrry much, what is the defining factor between eds and disordered eating? ive been researching this for ages and from what ive gathered i feel it could be too be put v basic the volume that it takes up your thoughts actions daily. i still find it crazy that purging assuming it meant more than a one off is considered disordered eating and not something more sinister. but then again my idea of disordered eating vs an ed is vastly different and part of me wants too believe that disordered eating isnt that bad emotionally taxing as an ed. again thats only because i want too believe that my issues fall into ed territory rather than disordered eating so ig my opinion of that is slightly skewed ha. but regardless, do you think an ed could be more defined in comparison by the amount it takes up in ur life brain space thoughts etc are mostly if not entirely consumed by thoughts of food, weight, eating etc. and that although disordered eating and eds can follow similar behaviours etc the defining factor lies mostly in the amount it takes up in ur life if that makes sense . thanking u : ",
"75 calories in surplus equals one 1 kg of fat gain? or not? possible triggering content contains weight loss gain . so this is basically just my obsessive thoughts and something i have been wondering about since forever. i am quite underweight atm, but regularly experience huge binge episodes, think eating 6 to 1 , calories in a day within a span of 1 to 5 hours. this is minus my bmr by the way so those calories are excess, and on top of my daily bmr by that logic i should gain 2 pounds or 1 kg every time i binge do this. yet this doesn't seem to be the case. when i fast for 2 to 4 days after a binge. i do not exercise during fasts i lose all of the gained weight plus more despite only burning like half or less of the calories i binged on the days before. it makes me paranoid. how does it work? my measurements do not go up either. yet when you go on quora for example, doctors say you absolutely would gain 1 kg with my behavior cause you eat the calories in surplus, it is science. but is it really? it's just something that really bothers me cause there seems to be no clear cut answer to my question on this. cause even fasting for 4 days for me is not even 5 calories cause low bmr, yet i still lose all my binge weight? am i not absorbing calories? are they hiding inside me? i don't get it, and google doesn't help, it says yes we do gain weight from binges but they talk about a binge and say ''3 '' calories, which is a huge lol for me. i have been basically maintaining now going through binge and restrict but i should be gaining when looking at my binge episodes. every day i am scared this weight is secretly hiding inside me and i am going to wake up 2 plus pounds heavier over night someday really soon. i'm also not over calculating my binge calories, they are horrific. is there any science on this? i know this is not normal behaviour btw, i am trying very hard to stop binges.",

"annoyed when people comment show interest in ur food.. i feel guilty abt it but it infuriates me when my mum will comment on what i eat. its not meant in a bad way actually meant as praise im sure, i just hate it. e.g. for the past 8 months ive been vegetarian going vg wrong reasons too begin w but its getting there . and she'll always comment asking, what im eating, how i made it etc saying 'she wants too be more healthy like me' or asking 'do u still eat bread? ' or 'don't u crave meat or sugar or anything?'. or someone will comment saying i need too 'use oil in that pan or itll burn why havent u put oil in?' like dude. over my life that shits not going in back off. my mum will always be inquisitive about what im eating. it causes so much friction because ill try shut her down straight away amp; be horrible about it which i feel guilty for, but then feel even more guilty because i feel not 'disordered enough' if ppl r wanting too eat like this. stupid ik. and when i decide too eat outside my normal time frame or im having a snack she says flippant things like 'how are you always eating and still stay looking like that.' or 'god you eating again ?' amp; i just feel so guilty even though its not meant in a bad way. growing up anything like dieting would be seperated from us as kids but now she'll say things like 'oh cant eat that how am i gonna loose weight if i eat like this' or 'yes you buy those again they have so much less cals or fat' and she begins too eat take interest in my foods or even worse my sfs but she says these things with pride in a way like shes kinda proud too be aware of cals etc. fair enough ik dieting culture is normal but i always feel im in competition. even though ik were not and she isn't counting or anything it just does. i love cooking and am actually fairly good but cooking what i eat for everyone is stressful for so many reasons not only cant i measure it correctly if i do but i also dont want them too eat what i do. not because its unhealthy food or something bcs its not, but because then i feel if they do, im not disordered since ppl want r choosing too eat this too. can never win. idk thanks for coming too my rant",

unfamiliar situation and idk what the right thing to do issss. im not nesssisarily 'in recovery' but ive been going through a phase the past two months of eating alot more it feels like a less intense version of the extreme hunger i felt 8 months ago so i know what it feels like but it just doesn't feel as intense idk. but im just trying too not fight back and embrace it for what it is atm and im kind of enjoying it almost? which is good ig. the only thing is i just can tell anymore if im too hungry or full. i feel constantly bloated as soon as im awake. i go from feeling starving in the morning and sick too feeling so full after eating or drinking one thing like a sip of water or a gummy vitamin . i go too bed feeling sick from being so full and plan too restrict the next day and then when the day comes i just want too eat again. when i cant tell if i feel full or not is it better too eat or not? i rly dont know. things are still harder than i think they are and i find myself so worried the more i continue eating like this that ill never get my ed 'back' silly ik but im fucking terrified by it. not scared enough apparently though too start restricting again . its like my body doesnt agree w it anymore but i know its the right thing. just confused and stressed. any advice thank u lovely ppl lt;3,
"just purged one of my all time favorite meals and got toilet water up my nose in the process mild vent, sorry . exactly as title says. i don't even know how i got here. it's only been, like, 3 weeks since i started purging consistently like this but it's become so habitual already. the worst part is that while i hate the act of purging itself and the splash of toilet water ugh , all the self hatred i've had for not being able to restrict anymore is gone. i don't need to restrict, i can just get rid of it and then my stomach feels bad that i'm not hungry after anyways. logically, i know this is horrible and i'm ruining the many years of dental orthodontic work i've had done but i finally don't hate myself for eating anymore. man. i had no idea adulthood would be like this.",
"autism and ed?. hello, i was reading up on how autism and eating disorders often go hand in hand, and it makes so much sense to me. i was wondering if people relate to this and, if they feel comfortable, share their experiences. i also read that treatment tends to be less effective for autistic people. people's thoughts on that? is there something else we can do to manage to have an ed and autism more effectively then?",

"progressing in therapy. hello all, i posted here some months ago saying i was able to 'eat regularly' for a week iirc and that was a big deal for me. i wanted to update with good news : obviously there have been some ups and downs since then, but my weight has been stable for months now. and my therapist has deemed it suitable that we move on from specialised cbt for the ed, to dbt. the dbt is apparently a natural progression and meant to reduce my vulnerability to ed relapse. as part of that we are doing a lot of ""chain analysis"" of problem behaviours doesn't have to be ed related, but for example restricting so i can stop any bad thoughts leading to maladaptive behaviours in its tracks. i'm just sharing, hopefully this can help others see recovery is possible, even if i can't say i'm fully there yet. i have a long way to go and it was a lot of work getting here. i had to stop going on reddit tbh. also, disclaimer i had to first sort out my depression which compounded my ed, by fully confronting an interpersonal issue. once that was out of the way i really felt more able to follow the regular eating and more motivated to succeed. my therapist said that once i'm at a good place with the dbt and more stable, i can do ptsd therapy, again to reduce my vulnerability to relapse. so i'm looking forward to that : ",

"psilocybin amp; self body image. i read that researchers are exploring psilocybin as a novel treatment for body dysmorphia, feeding and eating disorders, so i want to share my experience with magic mushrooms and the overall impact this has had on my body image. i hope to hear from others who have had experiences both helpful and unhelpful with this, as well. i recently tried psilocybin for the first time, and i now incorporate it into a sort of structured routine of microdosing every few months. people always say, don t look in the mirror on psychedelics. but looking in the mirror on mushrooms is the first time i feel i ve ever truly seen myself visibly exhausted, sick, and starved from striving to be enough of anything, at the request of no one. this sounds like a negative experience but truly it has been overwhelmingly positive for my self image. having had an opportunity to see myself as enough, and knowing that this perspective is available to me from time to time, has been very freeing. i have always viewed myself as a strong woman, but the person i saw in the mirror a was girl visibly burdened by shame, self doubt, and fear of losing control. the overwhelming sense of compassion i have toward myself when i see her is so valuable. in my normal life, i have discovered an enhanced ability to offer myself graciousness, patience, and breathing room to explore. this trickles down to how i interact with others who are existing on this planet, as well. i looked at my sweet baby cats and my dogs and i saw souls who exist to explore life, who view me as their everything, and who if they have emotions probably would be heartbroken to know how much i feel like not enough. i realized how much energy i put toward focusing on myself and trying to control things, and how brief my time with my pets will be. and how many opportunities to go on walks and to breathe in their fur and to kiss their face i stand to miss if i don t recognize my chains from this disorder, or evaluate why they are there, or ask why i am so unwilling to fight them. i can see now that my disorder is not my friend and it will never stop demanding more from me. life is out there, and it will never tell me the truth about that. i am not recovered and i don t think this will ever be fixed, but being able to understand the truth of what this is, at least momentarily, has been so helpful. . . . . . tl;dr i am optimistic about the future of psychedelic therapy for the treatment of body dysmorphia and related eating behaviors. please comment your personal experiences with body image amp; psychedelics ",

"dae as a woman feel compelled to lose weight to be smaller than the men around them?. i'm taking a class this quarter with a m professor i've had for a few different classes over the years since i'm really interested in his research, but he's always been really slim due to being an avid rock climber and every class i can't help but compare how i'm a lot heavier than him and how i feel i should weigh less because i am female and shorter. it bothers me because i enjoy the class and shouldn't be focusing on comparing myself to others, but every class the urge to lose weight creeps to the forefront of my mind. for some reason i feel way more compelled to lose weight and compare myself to men than women and i think it's due to societal beauty standards for women with the expectation to be petite small and to take up less space than men. and it's not just this prof, i experience this urge to lose weight when i interact with my male friends who are taller and weigh less. for me, it's also nothing to do with attraction since i feel this way even toward my gay male friends who i have no interest in. i feel a similar urge when i know women who weigh less, however this urge is greater when comparing myself to men because societal expectations for women revolve around being petite short. how does one get over this? my struggle is that while i shouldn't compare myself to others, logically speaking, i am shorter and i am female, so therefore to be a healthy weight i should weigh less and be physically smaller than a man who is taller or anyone for that matter. i don't know how to reconcile this obsession to lose weight because it feels logical to want to lose weight if that makes sense. can anyone else relate? anyone have any tips on overcoming this particular comparison?",

"feeling lonely. i started losing weight again super quickly after breaking up with my bf of 6 years last july. he cheated on me with a girl i d always been jealous of how skinny she was. in both of my ltrs i tended to binge and gain weight over the years, only to then get left for someone smaller than me when i become overweight. funnily enough, i weighed the exact same amount at each break up, down to the pound. i m trying to not read into that but my ed has really latched on to the idea that i would have been more lovable if i had been smaller. being hotter than the girl i was left for is a giant trigger thought. it s almost like i want him to see how small i ve gotten and what, be worried about me? want me back? i wouldn t date him again even if he did. i just find i can t stop i don t want to meet new people, i don t want to think about love, i just want to stay alone in my room and not be bothered to eat. i m just lonely and have no one to really talk to about this. even my old sh habits are creeping back in. i feel like i m too old for this shit and should know better by now. : ",
"i have been overweight my entire life so i can t physically imagine being healthy . i capped at 275lbs by the time i was 18 or so. i am 26 now. i moved away from my abusive home that promoted obesity as fun and fuck it why not mentality. to be completely blunt with you i don t want to change. on one hand, of fucking course i do or i wouldn t be posting this, pleading for help but i ve been this weight and had this routine for so long.. it s frighteningly daunting to change. i don t even believe my body is capable of shedding a single pound. the sound of exercise is horrifying with how bad my body hurts even walking, and how bad my asthma is. i can t do much before my lungs are completely on fire and i m in tears. i work full time at a semi active job, because my previous more active job had my back constantly seizing up and making lasting injuries just trying to clean hotel rooms. and even this job is painful for me and i ve been looking for sedentary jobs that stop hurting me so much when i get home, i have only a few hours before i need to go to sleep for work. so i as much as i hate to admit, refuse to waste any of that time exercising. i want to enjoy my life, doing things indoors. knowing my weight, i only have so much time left to enjoy anyways and i have art commissions for my side hustle to do digitally. until i am able to have my own place to live, i am stuck with my boyfriend s parents who honestly spike my c ptsd since his mom isn t much different than mine. so i don t leave the room. i don t cook meals unless everyone in the house is asleep and it s a quiet meal. but lord knows if i will bother to cook meals in my own place either. i lack self restraint control, i can t bring it up in therapy because we are focusing on reprocessing so many different traumatic situations, we don t have time for stupid food talk. i have a nutritionist prescribed to me and even though she 1 understands my current situation she wasn t even sure how to help. she said she wouldn t tell me don t eat this. , but rather eat smaller portions of this. which is completely fair. but i am fucking hungry. i cannot focus on anything as my ravenous brain immediately starts seeking food until i am literally about to vomit from being so full. it s never satisfied. i am trying to get officially diagnosed, in august, again with adhd since i know my old meds used to suppress these food seeking desires but right now i just can t stand to be alive. having to hide under layers of clothes, be embarrassed by how much space i take up everywhere, how when i walk into fast food, people don t seem shocked at all that someone like me is there. i don t know what to do something that won t make me hurt; wont make me breathless; wont make me physically shake from hunger despite having just ate a full meal; yet is magically easy and simple to do i blame myself entirely. i really do. my mom promoted over eating, but it was my fault i didn t restrain myself.. it s my fault i am such a toddler, pouting about hating exercise i can walk but it hurts my back that i can t do it for too many miles.. and having to physically do any work when all i want is the damn meds to fucking stop me from feeling hunger i guess i just want someone to hear me, is all.. everyone i work with and live with is 14 lbs or so, and i feel so alone..",

"day 138 binge free tw: explicit weight gain loss mentions. it was going well until i started weighing myself again two weeks ago. i realized i was losing weight pretty rapidly, one pound a day. i was getting addicted to the feeling of seeing the number on the scale drop everyday with such little effort. this high went on for five consecutive days of effortless weight loss until it all come to, what felt like, a screeching halt. i stepped on the scale and found i weighed the same as the day before. this triggered my ed brain big time. i started restricting myself to one meal a day. i restricted for two days with little success in losing. that s when the binge urges came full swing. it was horrible. i began snacking a couple times a day, and even though i knew it wasn t a binge i d felt like it was. so much anxiety and emotional turmoil. i knew i was starting to slip into a binge restrict cycle. i ve gotten pretty good at having enough self awareness to realize these things. i took a good, hard look at myself and decided to nurture my inner child. i decided to wasn t going to let myself be overcome by this toxic cycle. i stopped weighing myself and let myself eat normal meals. it s difficult finding a balance while losing weight after recovering from an eating disorder. i keep telling myself there are healthy methods to lose weight, they just take patience. patience is something i know a lot of us ed ers struggle with. we re so used to losing weight in unhealthy, damaging, and quick ways that when we learn the healthy 1lb a week way it s almost laughable to imagine not racing to the finish line. but, i m back on track. not pushing overly healthy food 1 of the time, but not eating terribly and trying to make healthier, more fulfilling choices. i have a goal to lose 1lb a week, if i lose more than that that s just a bonus. this ed caused my weight gain, but i won t let it consume me forever. i m getting there and i m proud.",

"my cheeks are burning. oh god, i'm so ashamed right now. i work from home in my living room and often have tv on in the background. i watched thin again this afternoon. 1 minutes until the end, i hear my husband coming home from work and quick shut off the tv. he went downstairs so watched the last few minutes on my phone. made sure to watch all the credits, so it wouldn't for some reason show on the ""continue watching"" list on the hbo app homepage. checked it worked on my phone. good. turned the tv back on and loaded up hbo app again, was going to double check it didn't show there either. got distracted with emails, my husband walks through the living room looking for something. looks right at the tv, and the stupid app went back to the thin movie page instead of the home screen, showing the fully watched bar complete. he didn't say anything and just went downstairs. my cheeks are burning... he knows i've struggled in the past with disordered eating and drug use related to weight loss. he knows i'm currently on a hyper healthy ""diet,"" but he doesn't really know how little it is when all meals are added up... i'm 34 years old and this is some dumb teenager sh t right now. i'm squirming like, do i explain what it is and how i was just ""curious""? draw more attention to my problems by over explaining questions which may not even have occurred to him? i'll probably say nothing, he probably didn't give it much thought, but oh god, i feel like a teenager that just got caught jerking off. the shame. okay, deep breaths.",
"resolving to recover makes me feel like a failure. i don't want to say goodbye to my eating disorder, but i need to recover. anorexia is preventing me from achieving some very important goals in my life. in a way, i feel excited to be able to eat more, socialize more freely, and work towards some pretty cool life goals, but choosing recovery also makes me feel... invalid, or like a failure? it feels like choosing recovery signals that i'm not strong enough to be a ""good anorexic."" can anybody else relate?",

"realizing 15 years late that most of my disordered thought patterns began during a period of ableist teasing as a kid. not coping well.. longtime lurker who made an account to vent about this here bc i don't have anyone irl who would understand. i feel so stupid being upset about it so many years later but i just can't believe i never made the connection. towards the end of primary school beginning of junior high, i developed really severe food allergies and had to go on a very restrictive diet that resulted in me losing a lot of weight. it was an extremely stressful time for my family, and i almost died no less than three times over the course of about two years due to mistakes with foods. i remember being really frustrated with how my body had failed me, and developing a lot of anxiety about food in general. in the midst of struggling with this and trying to adapt, all the kids around me were honestly terrible. i never really comprehended it at the time, but looking back, it's no wonder things got bad later. i was constantly made a spectacle of for having to eat different foods, was asked invasive questions, was accused of doing it for attention, had rumors spread around that i was anorexic which is ironic now, considering that i have a restrictive ed lmao . it was around this time that i remember beginning to hate my body's appearance, as well as actively dreading and avoiding social situations that involved food. it just makes me so fucking pissed to think about. like i was already struggling so badly at that time, feeling like everything in my life was out of control, and everyone had to get up in my business and make my life that much harder. all of those kids were shit, and the adults that enabled them and didn't stop them are even worse. anyways. i know that being angry about it won't change anything. but over a decade of ed later and in the midst of my worst relapse to date with no end in sight, i can't help it. i'm 25 years old and i still dread eating in front of others, have major anxieties about food, and despise the way i look. it feels so pathetic that i can't move on.",
"younger sister coming over. i have been restricting really heavily for a bit because i had a binge period and my sister is coming over this weekend. when i last saw her i avoided eating mostly, and the time before i made a huge effort to eat the food i made her normally because i really don't want to pass on or tell my sister about my ed because of my family's view on my body since developing my ed but the problem is the way i show love is by cooking for peoplem. i obsessively bake but also really live inviting people over for food irish jew but yeah i am stressed about it. i know one day won't matter but i am tempted to just blame nausea as that is a thing i need constantly have? idek i am a big recluse and seeing my sister like once every 3 4 months is a huge deal to me and i don't want to avoid it because ed reasons, but it is so tempting. this is also the case with my one friend i see irl who is eded and so i make a lot of effort to eat normally around them but it can trigger a binge and then compensatory behaviour",
recovered but the days of being immersed in my ed haunt me.. idk if anyone relates but sometimes i think back to how i was when i was really entrenched in it. i was so out of it. i did so many dumb things and said really dumb things bc i wasn t fully there. i wish i could go back in time and snap myself out of it but that can t happen. i hate to think about all the people i hurt offended. and whatever they may think of me now. ugh.,
"why are my relapses so comparatively short?. i am definitely an on and off anorexic where i ve cycled through restriction and quasi recovery for years instead of consistently suffering. in my case i do so quite rapidly my longest relapse has barely been 6 months, not counting time in treatment, and most are between 2 3 months. it doesn t take long for things to get severe for me so maybe that s why my relapses are so short lived. i m writing about this because this is my biggest point of comparison to others and biggest thing that makes me feel invalid. my illness onset was also short and i feel that i considered recovery too early for it to be serious. i hear people talk about experiencing their disorder for years before seeking help and having relapses that last gt;6 months. idk is this more normal than i think it is? can anyone else speak to this or relate?",
"can t restrict like i used to so my ed has turned to purging but i can t even do that???. i ve purged before, it s not like this is my first rodeo. but i could not force up my lunch today for the first time ever?? i spent like ten minutes dry heaving and drooling over the toilet for hardly anything to come up but my body is reacting the way it normally does after i purge anyways. so i have all the shitty feelings without any of the emptiness i was looking for. getting older really has just made my ed so much worse now that i can t do any of the things i used to do when i was a teenager ",

"i really don't understand how i can possibly recover when three normal meals are already more than the calories i should eat in a day. i don't even have room for snacks and i don't understand how others can. i'm at a point in my life where i'm really ready to leave my ed behind. you know when you really start thinking ""i'm so done with this""? yeah, that's the point i'm at. but the fear of gaining weight is just so strong. before my ed, i used to maintain a normal bmi effortlessly; my hunger cues were on point, and i had no notion about calories at all. but now, looking back, i know i used to eat meals that right now would feel restrictive, because back then my hunger cues were actually those of a normal fucking person. i'm at my pre ed weight right now, so it's not like i need to gain weight, but i'm still hungry all the time and i'm still thinking about food all the time. i eat three meals a day that amount to pretty much what i need to eat on a daily basis, and in fact i'm not losing weight. but it literally just feels like in my deepest relapses, just at a higher weight. if i want a snack, i need to reduce one of the meals in order to make room for it. if i have a higher calorie dinner, my body won't just compensate automatically by making me less hungry the next day; i'll have to consciously reduce my portions. i cannot have desserts unless i cut something out of other meals. right now i just had breakfast a solid, substantial breakfast with all the necessary nutrients and i'm hungrier than before. why bother having meals at all then? it's incredibly frustrating. i will never recover with these meals. ever. i will have to restrict and think about food for the rest of my freaking life. and i don't want that but i also don't know the alternative, except gaining weight forever. obviously dietitians and therapists don't help, in fact they never did. always stating that these meals should satiate me so it's obviously all mental. which is why i'm starting to slowly realize that i will never recover. and it's so depressing because it's not like i need my ed or anything. i don't need it, i don't want it, it doesn't make me happy, it doesn't help me, if i could just trust my body and eat whatever i want without thinking about it like i used to do before the onset of the illness i would recover right now. many people say they'll never recover because they cannot let go of their coping mechanism, or control or whatever, but i can. it's not about that, for me. but i still can't recover. i'm broken. my hunger cues are broken and i'll never be able to fix them. and honestly, i'm not sure that i'll able to live this life much longer. people don't realize just how horrible and life consuming thinking about food all the time is.",

torn between wanting too try at life or sink deeper into ed before trying too recover. i feel like part of me is ready too move on if you will. try and improve myself and my life and engage and try at life again. ive felt like this for a little while but am still scared too lean into the idea and really give 'recovery' or something like it a proper go. all ive been doing since xmas is trying too restrict and 'failing'. my mind feels split af. im changing my mind from one extreme too the next. for instance i just spent two hours researching what would be an extremely restrictive diet and planning how ill start it too all of a sudden thinking maybe big big maybe im kinda sorta ready too recover ? i dont feel at this particular moment im using restriction too numb my emotions or as a choping mechanism i think right now my main reason for continuing restriction and clinging too my ed is so that i can reach my lower weight and then feel 'readier' too recover. as it will also be more physical. since also im eating around maintence daily even tbkigh i attempt too eat xxx and fail. its like my body is just rejecting restriction again. but im still being vegan??? idk im in such a torn place of wanting both but all options seems too have too go through restriction first before i actually consider them. im making myself even more miserable and am now just scared af too feel consistently happy because i worry so so much that ill loose grasp on my ed. so ill just purposely trigger myself etc so i stay depressed oops. im so conflicted and so scared too ask for help or what the right decision is. thanks for reading ooft. sending u all the best,
"boyfriend cooking, equality in the relationship. so for the last year i ve cooked all my boyfriend and i s dinners dinner is the only meal we always have together . i need control in the kitchen and in the recipes that are chosen. i feel tired of being the one always doing it. if he were to make us dinners it would be something i wouldn t want to eat anyways mac n cheese from the box, ramen, etc so it s like do i ask him to do more and relinquish the control and probably end up not wanting to eat what he makes, or do i just harbor this bitterness. how does it work with the partner you live with?",
"dealing with a lot of stuff, feeling ugly because i feel like i get told i'm ugly constantly. i'm not able to think clearly, and when i try to work on projects or do anything that requires thought, i burn out quickly and become sleepy and shaky. i was told i have reactive hypoglycaemia that is triggered by hunger. i get it even on days when i thought i was eating properly, which is annoying and discouraging. i've had this since my early twenties when i started having issues with disordered eating. my metabolism is all over the place. i gain weight really easily it seems, or it feels that way but idk what's normal now that i'm 3 . maybe it feels worse because my life isn't as physically active as it was ten years ago when i was in college and walking around campus. i also have other mental health problems like social anxiety and agoraphobia. i've had agoraphobia since my teens, but it went away for a few years during my time in college. i am fixated constantly on the time that i was going to school. i was happy then even though i still had issues, and it was also the same time that i started to have disordered eating issues. i wanted and still want to be thin even though i don't think i'm pretty enough to look good at any weight if that makes sense. i think i have body dysmorphia as well but it's hard to accept that because i am convinced that i truly am ugly or at least not conventionally good looking and it's hard to believe it's just in my head as i have been told and continue to be told randomly by guys and sometimes girls that i'm ugly. i was told a few months ago i looked horrible by some old man walking by, and was told i was ugly by my uncle's fitness trainer who was at a family gathering the year before covid. these comments on my appearance have messed me up, and they seem like they happen constantly, thus why i'm agoraphobic. i'm sorry this rant is all over the place. just feeling bad about myself but i think it's because i'm inside a lot lately and not able to distract as easily from these thoughts.",
"do you think that ur ed could be simplified into one thing?. do you think although its different for evryone ofc that ur ed could be simplified into one thing mainly restrictive im talking about with this example ? like i think i just tried too kinda sum up why i restrict into a sentence and i wonder if that at its core that is what a restrictive ed is. for me at least. i dont mean this sums it up for everyone. for instance i kinda knew the answer but i wanted too see what google results came up with when i typed in ""whats it called when you dont want too eat because youll feel too much"" and ofc an came up as a top result. and ik that eds are complex mental illnesses but when we invalidate ourselves over little things i feel like this gives me perspective because sometimes i feel like having an ed can come down too a 'simple?' thing. like not wanting too eat because you wont be able too numb ur emotions. idk if this is making sense. using that example like what other reason could that result in besides from an ed. thats surely not a normal thinking pattern or that of a dieter. is this making sense? thanks for reading lol i hope this kinda made sense.",
"comparing yourself to your teenage self. this is probably what fucks with my head the most. in late high school i recovered somewhat, i at least got to a healthy weight. at that same weight now, my measurements are way different 1 years later. logically, i get it. my body is just changing as i get older. but part of me can t accept that, and maybe definitely cried about it i just want to genuinely like my body without any of the other mental gymnastics",

"but why?. i thought i was in the clear. i'm a real life adult with a kid and i can eat as much blue cheese dressing as i want and not feel guilty. so why am i back to contemplating whether or not i should go back to taking my meds the right way?? when they were first prescribed years ago life was chaotic and i genuinely accidentally lost 2 pounds because they made me vitamin deficient and killed my appetite. i felt terrible and had no idea why because no doctor bothered to tell me about that potential side affect. and once again life is chaos and proper medication management has fallen to the wayside and now everything gives me heartburn and my head hurts and i want to hide under a blanket and do nothing but exist. how did i spend the better part of a year feeling like this and still function like a normal person? why am i considering riding out this terrible feeling until i get used to living off of english muffins, peanut butter and tums again?",
"why can't i recover like a normal person?. i see that most people recover by following a meal plan, gaining weight slowly, gradually opening up to new foods. and then there's me, who every time that tries recovery ends up eating all the food all the time and gains so much weight. i've been in recovery since christmas, making use of the holidays to allow myself to eat more, and i told myself that i would follow a 3 meals 3 snacks meal plan but also give myself permission to eat more snacks if i wanted them...but i just eat all the time instead. i wanted to gain weight slowly but i gained so much it's almost unbelievable. i met the criteria for clinically severe anorexia on the 24th of december, and now i'm weight restored. i went from severely underweight to normal bmi in 2 weeks. it's like every time i try recovery and try a normal meal plan my body takes over and goes ""lol no, you're gonna eat all the food and you're gonna do it now"". i'll have a normal breakfast and then just a couple hours later i'll be raiding the pantry. like today i had a very substantial breakfast with scrambled eggs on buttered toast and a piece of fruit, yet less than 1 hour later i went back and had loads of chocolate, more fruit, ham, a few pieces of candy, some bread with pb, and even had some butter plain. now i've eaten more than my meal plan for the day, and it's not even lunchtime my brain is now screaming at me to skip lunch and or purge but i cannot bring myself to do either of these things. i'm trying my best to avoid freaking out and to convince myself that it's not a binge and it's okay and i can still eat my meals and carry on with my day...but it's so hard when the only thing you see is you're packing on the pounds and just spend your whole day eating and eating and eating. plus, as an adult, eating like a person with anorexia is embarrassing enough, but eating like a 15 year old highly active male teenager is even worse. i just want it to be over already. i feel like a complete pig and i've stopped following recovery material because all those people who recover ""the right way"" trigger me so much. they're gonna recover in a skinny body and i won't because i'll never be able to stop eating, i can no longer control myself. i was never overweight in my life but i feel it's just gonna be my destiny because i'm just not able to apply any moderation to my eating.",
recovery. question: has anyone else experienced almost like side effects of starting to eat more? i never hit a crazy low bmi but restricted probably 22 23 hours a day. my nutritionist is easing me in which has been great but we have added in two protein shakes a day. ever since i started to hit that goal i have almost felt more horrible and i am noticing that i start to get super shaky way earlier in the day and if i try to exercise even several hours after eating i get dizzy and nauseous. is maybe my body just adjusting? i have never experienced any of this before but i have also never given it a fair shot at recovery either.,

"boudoir photos actually, photos in general. how do you cope?. this post is part rant, part seeking advice. nsfw tag just in case. my history with ed is something i've kept a secret to a lot of people in my life, including some of my best friends. to be honest, being at my age 26 and still struggling with image and my ed makes me very ashamed. it's embarrassing to cry over food, restrict, binge, exercise excessively, and lose and gain the same 1 pounds over and over. i don't look like someone who has struggled with anorexia maybe a little on the smaller side, but not clinically underweight. but i'm not over chasing the dragon, not yet. i keep thinking i can live the life i want and maintain the weight i want. i know this is taboo and unhealthy to say out loud, but i just want to be honest about it somewhere. i don't know if i want to give up my ed. my friend has just invited me to take boudoir photos with them, and this isn't the first time someone has asked me about this. i love the idea of a boudoir photoshoot, i love fashion and lingerie and body positivity, but it scares the absolute shit out of me. i have a very difficult relationship with my image and body. i hate any and all photographs. it took so much nerve to do my damn engagement photo shoots. in a perfect world, i'd take some sexy pictures and boom, i'd feel great about myself, but i doubt that will happen. i love that people freely express themselves and their sexuality, and i think that's important. but i feel so infantile and stupid for being so hung up on my body and am worried people judge me for my insecurity. maybe i'm not expressing this the most eloquent or pc way, so i hope this is not triggering to read. how do you guys handle photos, have you ever done boudoir photos, and what do you think about this?",
"when to consider medication?. this isn't 1 about my eating disorder, but it's related. i've been working on recovery the last 3 years and i've made a lot of progress, but i also feel like that has revealed how my problems go deeper than my ed. i don't know how to explain it exactly, but basically i'm a pretty intense person. i have intense emotions, usually in phases of 2 4 days, sometimes longer or shorter. if nothing's holding me back, i'll keep myself busy to the point of exhaustion which kinda makes me feel better, but isn't sustainable. i used to think this was linked to my ed, but now i don't care as much about weight food and the rest is still there. what's making me want to seek help is, the effect on my relationship. i try to be a good partner, but i know my emotions still come through and i can be difficult. sometimes i lose perspective, which leads to fights. my coping mechanisms ed, staying super busy aren't good for the relationship obviously, which i can control but it's always a battle. previously, i was on medication on and off for several years citalopram aka celexa . it definitely leveled me out and actually helped address my ed symptoms a lot. but it also made me sluggish and tired all the time, basically sedated. i didn't feel like myself. i was mostly just sleeping when i should have been exploring life and making friendships. i know that's not the only option and the dose can also be adjusted, but i'm scared of going through that again. last time i tried it, i remember having thoughts like ""fuck it, life is intense, i'm an intense person, and it's okay to live an intense life."" i saw a therapist for six months recently, i came to her wanting to talk about other things but we wound up talking about my mood symptoms too. she said i showed some signs of a possible mood disorder but it wasn't 1 clear, and recommended i bring this up with my doctor if i ever get concerned in the future. so i guess i'm concerned. but also scared to ask my doctor because i don't know what will happen. idk, i know this isn't exactly the right place for this but don't know who else to ask. how have y'all thought about medication, whether to try it or not, how to navigate the process?",

"binge restrict cycle makes me eat absurdly large gross amounts of fatty condiments. please help.. i ve been on a restrict binge cycle for years. i ll eat a very little amount for days then gorge myself for a couple days after my restriction period comes to an end. for some reason, however, when i do binge, i always feel the need to add disgusting and i mean truly disgusting amounts of high caloric high fat ingredients to whatever i m preparing. for example, say it s a day i decide i am eating whatever tf i want. i will go to mcdonald s and order burgers junior chickens. i will then ask for extra mayonnaise with said items. i will then add my own mayo yes i ll bring a mayo container with me in my car and add even more plus i ll even add extra salt hell i ve even brought extra kraft single slices with me to add to my food. another example. i was making spaghetti for dinner tonight i ve been restricting for three days prior to today and i was trying to make it a normal spaghetti recipe. but for whatever reason i compulsively added a huge slab of butter to the pasta sauce. also a week ago i had tacos for dinner and added more sour cream cheese than the taco shell could hold and i still didn t think it was enough. my boyfriend thinks i m disgusting it is though, the amount of fatty toppings i add to food don t even make sense why am i like this? my parents cooked yummy, healthy ish dinners growing up all my life. why don t feel this weird compulsion to make any food that i eat on my binge days soooooo much more unhealthy than they need to be? the things i do to my food dont even improve the taste. they make it worse. but it s as if i crave fat salt to the extent that even those on my 6 pound life would probably think i m weird. whenever i eat food that someone else prepares for me homemade, something i don t eat often at a restaurant, etc i always try to remind myself how good it tastes and why i don t need to add absurd amounts of butter oil mayo salt to every thing i eat when i m binging. the only reason i m not morbidly obese super unhealthy is because of how much restriction i do in between these binge periods. does anyone relate to this? edit more examples from the top of my head: making sandwiches for my boyfriend and myself. i will make his normally and make mine with 3x the amount of butter mayo than his it s disgusting. i literally don t even like how it tastes this way. and i ll be super secretive about it. wtf any time i follow a recipe, if it calls for oil butter i will automatically add at least double the recommended amount. same with salt i ll add butter to foods that don t even require it what so ever. any kind of soup, ramen instant noodles, literally anything and will seriously not eat it if i don t have something fatty to sneak in. one time i wanted to get a sub from subway. i then didn t end up getting it because i realized i was out of mayo at home and didn t want to embarrass myself with asking for 4x the normal amount of mayo. embarrassing. i know. i had a bite of my boyfriends regularly made sub the other day and it was soo good. better than any sub i ever order. so why am i doing this???",

"having an embarrassing problem body issues and coochie mention lol . this years relapse was unfortunately fast and extreme and as a result i have ended up with what i think is a strange body composition. i am not underweight but have a lot of loose skin which has resulted in a thigh gap that is wider at the top than the middle and i feel like my coochie has no protection lol. it s hard to explain. my skin sags on my thighs and they kind of lump together after a few inches down to fill in more space. it s caused a lot of irritation from my bits rubbing against the fabric of my underwear, no matter what kind. i ve also started queefing daily in a lot of embarrassing situations where it shouldn t happen. just by my existing and moving around basically. being around people puts me on edge worrying that it will happen when i least expect it. and it just sucks to feel a loss of autonomy in that i can t control a very intimate part of my body. sorry this is so tmi but i don t have anywhere i feel comfortable bringing it up doctor trauma and i don t have anywhere else i can really ask but here dae have this problem and what do you do about it?",

"family comments on aging and weight gain. hello i had tried to recover over quarantine and gained 3 lbs and i am kind of relapsing now, but recently my younger cousin was going through old photos we had taken together. they were taken when i was probably my lowest weight, and she said how i look so much younger. the photos were only taken 2 years ago and i haven't changed that much but i do think i look older because of my weight now. although i am sure the stress of the past two years has done something, but i guess i just hope i don't look like i have aged that much, but as someone who is into skincare and i do care about looking younger as much as i wish i didn't care and as much as i wish i could emotionally align with my rational perspective on agism in society i am just not there yet it just really bit me... and i just really want to lose the weight again. but sometimes it feels like i don't have the drive to run for hours each day and i after gaining the weight i have found other ways to hate myself that fulfill my need for self destruction... and i kind of wish i didn't even try to recover. i wasn't really going anywhere here, i just wanted to rant, and if anyone else has experienced, and how do you deal with it? i don't want to be so appearance obsessed, i know youth does not last forever, but the desire to be rail thin again and look younger even if just for a bit ... is just so tempting.",
"struggling with appetite issues and don't know what to do.. does anyone else have very bad appetite issues? i have anorexia nervosa, about ten years and i am twenty two. i am very underweight but normally can eat a good amount and maintain it. lately not so much though. lately, most foods have been sounding very unappetizing and disgusting even foods that i really enjoy. i feel very hungry, yet too weak physically to keep a lot of food down. i feel full so quickly than immediately feel exhausted right after, and even when hungry, so many foods and smells seem so unappetizing. for example, i've recently only been craving fatty cuts of meats like red meat, fried meats, or starches with a lot of fat like mashed potatoes or pasta. textures have been very nauseating unless very, very fatty or very crispy. the smell of food lingering makes me so sick that i sometimes throw up. and every time i eat i feel like i can just lay in bed and nap. i try to stay very hydrated with gatorade zeroes and pellegrino water all day. i wake up very late in the day and basically am always fatigued. the loss of appetite is very frustrating. nothing satisfies me literally besides very salty, fatty meat. otherwise, i feel unsatisfied which is so unrealistic and exhausting. i do not know what to do or what is wrong with me let alone if anyone else experiences this. edited to add that literally eating steak daily is not affordable at all ",

"a long rant about health problems and dietary restrictions and social isolation. cw: a few specifics about dietary restrictions for medical reasons , mention of weight loss no numbers sorry in advance that this is a pretty long read. i don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but i figured some of you might be able to relate. i am on the low fodmap diet, which is a super rigid, restrictive, seemingly nonsensical diet. i'm not on it by choice back in june my doctor and dietitian who don't specialize in treating ed patients advised me to start it because my ibs symptoms were out of control and running my life. i also have gastroparesis, but i don't think this diet does anything for that there are a few similarities to the gp diet, but they function in different ways to minimize symptoms . breaking the diet and eating even a small amount of one of the ""oh no nos"" can render me bed bound, or stuck on the toilet, or both, for days. when i first started the diet, i was doing pretty good with my ed i was almost done with php for depression, which was super helpful, and my team also knew to check in occasionally about my ed. my weight was healthy and stable, and with 8 weeks of php under my belt, i felt like the veil of depression was finally starting to lift. within a month, i unintentionally lost xx lbs because of the restrictive nature and complexity of the diet. all of my disordered eating thoughts, and many of my old behaviors, came back. because i was sick a lot of the time, and on medical leave from work, it was easy to isolate myself fuel my ed. i live with my so, but he's pretty oblivious. eventually, when i started showing signs of malnutrition, i told him how much weight i had lost, and he said he honestly hadn't noticed..i mean come on guy, i have body dysmorphia and even i could look in the mirror and see the changes in my appearance. somehow i managed to keep this shit up until around november, when my so said that if i didn't get help for this and depression, which didn't take long to come back , he might end our relationship. so i've been on the wait list for an ip res program for 8 weeks now...but i had to change insurance when i got fired from my job, and there is a big chance they won't accept out of state medicaid haven't been able to talk to the program coordinator about this yet . so there's the back story...now here comes a christmas story: i went to a good old fashioned friendsmas on thursday. i brought my own little boring ass dish for myself, but naturally, other friends brought food that actually looked good. i quizzed a couple of my friends about ingredients, and had a small amount of spicy potato curry, even though i know it was made with onion and garlic major oh no nos . like my so said, ""a small amount won't kill ya""...right? woke up the next morning feeling really nauseous. my friend, the host, was making pancakes and offered me one. i thought it might help with the nausea if i ate one dry, so i ate half a pancake before i realized ""oh shit i can't eat these"" gluten and dairy . and then i realized the beer we had been drinking the night before was infused with grapefruit another oh no no . don't even get me started on beer i'm not supposed to have any, but i've always just said fuck it and drank it anyways, and only have issues if i really overdo it. i drove home and spent the afternoon filling our toilet with ass piss. i wasn't able to spend christmas eve with my so and his stepdad like we had planned. i spent my evening surfing reddit and binge watching shrill. i am still sick today, so i had to call my parents and tell them i won't be coming to christmas at their house. they were pissed, because i knowingly consumed things that have the potential to make me sick, and they made an entire christmas meal that caters to my ridiculous dietary restrictions. i'm very sad i won't get to see them, but even more so my nephew and his parents due to my sil being very pregnant, covid, and all my health issues, it's been months since i saw them last. after i hung up the phone with them i called my so and just cried for a while about how much i hate my body, and this diet, and how my stomach issues have made my world so small over the past year. he was sympathetic i guess, until i asked him what time he's coming home later. he said that he's not, he's staying at his mom's house. she only lives 2 minutes away. he used the excuse of having to work tomorrow, but i'm 1 sure he's just crashing there because he's gonna be up late getting wine drunk with his mom. i quickly ended the call because i knew i was about to snap off and say something mean. sooo instead of saying it to his face, i texted him, like a mature, grown ass adult it was nothing attacking his character or him as a person re: not really that mean ...basically, i accused him of not giving a shit that i'm spending the entirety of christmas alone. he texted back ""what the fuck? you knew this was my plan"" no i did not actually , and that's it. no acknowledgement of my frustration, my loneliness...actually caring about seeing him and my family too obviously for christmas. i want to be done. i don't want to be on this diet anymore...i don't want to go to treatment again after 8 years of staying healthy enough not to need it...i don't want my life to be dictated by digestive issues...i don't want my so to just flippantly write me off as acting crazy whenever i bring up something that is bothering me usually i'm more mature than today . i don't want to be manipulated by him to go to treatment...everything about our relationship is always on his terms. anyway, i'm sorry this got so long, i just had to get it out somewhere. it kind of jumps all over the place, but long story short: my eating disorder and crippling depression are back. combine those two things with my chronic digestive issues and little to no social support, and i don't know how much longer i'll last. merry christmas, everyone...i hope you are doing whatever makes you happy today edit: typo",
"honest question time: should i buy a ringfit?. my workout schedule over the last few months hasn't been as good as i would like. i have to be mindful to not workout too much, plus i have to be careful of my knees because i have arthritis in both of them. so running is out of the question. i have an exercise bike, but i don't use it five days a week, i think because i get bored. i could do with some strength routine or similar, because exercise is a habit that i need for my wellbeing, aside from the eating disorder bull crap. i'm not sure if it's a good fit for me, but ringfit is cheaper than the gym, and i've been a bit paranoid about the gym ever since covid. has anyone here tried ringfit? was it helpful?",

"quickly falling bmi, so coming here for advice again:, . my two main treatment options, since my bmi will be too low soon for cfd, and alsana seems sus because of cover ups and very odd reviews, are erc denver and laureate. however, they have a rly bit difference in the wait times, and i m consistently losing weight. denver is 2 3weeks from 3 days ago, and laureate is 6 weeks. laureate is way smaller so therefore more personalized, which i think is better for me because i am sensitive might have asd and kind of picky with food, like meat fat and milk and mushrooms and asparagus and citrus desserts. however, if the waitlist is actually 6 weeks long i feel like it would take a really long time to recover from that point because i ve been low restricting fasting for a bit now. i ve heard some good things of erc denver pine, since it is less triggering than willow, and because denver is a hub for medicine. however, i ve also heard that staff can be abusive and it can be like prison they kick you out if you aren t doing well apparently ? unless you re super low bmi. being picky could be bad but i also know erc has pretty american basic food. it is larger so probably less personalized, and they might dislike me because i insulted and aca ed from the chicago erc it was terrible ",

"trans with an ed. my outpatient ed team kept blocking me from taking testosterone. they said it would make me bloat and gain weight, and i was already ""too heavy."" i wasn't having health issues due to my weight, i just have a larger body. they said i had to embrace my destiny and reality as a woman, date men, have kids, and stop avoiding my responsibilities. i fired them all, went to planned parenthood, and started on t in august. i also put together a new ed outpatient team. this is the first week i haven't purged. since 2 11. yes i've been binging and purging on a daily basis for over a decade. i finally feel like it's okay to eat. if my body changes, it's ok, i will still have drs that respect my identity. they are on my side and their goals are mine. my body has changed some in fact. i was not trying, but lost some weight from the testosterone. i stopped weighing myself so i didn't even know, until i went to the dr's recently. most of the ocd worrying and obsessive thoughts are gone. i did have a melt down a few weeks ago when i realized my shoulders got bigger and my waist got smaller, and none of my work shirts fit anymore. but it was a change that i was okay with and a fixable problem. i let out the seams in the shirts. anyway i was told a few years ago that i really would not be able to recover from the ed without gender affirming care. now i see what they meant. i couldn't trust my team until i knew that they weren't forcing me to lose weight, so i'd be more feminized gender conforming. i find it ironic that my team used fat phobia as a way to block me from transitioning, and keeping me in my ed. but here i am losing weight without trying and doing awesome with the ed. i knew better than them. we gotta trust our own wisdom sometimes.",

"how do you guys afford extreme hunger?. i'm going to try to apply for food stamps, because this is the first time in years my hunger has been this crazy. i was a chronic weed smoker for about 6 years on and off and it destroyed my appetite, and before that i was just a strict restricter. now that i'm i'm close to 3 my body can't handle the extreme ed behavior at all so i quit weed about 6 months ago and that fixed my appetite, but whoa my hunger is crazy. i literally just ate 3 minutes ago and i feel so empty already. i thought that would at least calm my hunger down, but it did nothing. the more i eat, the hungrier i get, which i welcome, but how do you all financially resolve this? i'm about 15 2 lbs underweight so i guess that makes sense that my body is trying to catch up. how do you guys do it? i do have about 12 meal prep containers so i guess i could put them to good use and of course i'd love to know your budgets. how much do you spend on food a month and how do you prepare all the food it seems to satisfy you. i'm not trying to restrict at all so bring all the food advice on.",
"i ate extra food last night.. y'all, i'm straight up in panic mode now. i'm nauseous, i feel bloated and disgusting, i've calculated every calorie i may have ingested yesterday. the scale is staring me in the face. i'm angry completely irrationally, so i won't act on it at my husband for allowing me to do it. i'm already planning how to make up for it today. sorry, i'm pretty much just venting, but no one else would possibly understand how i'm feeling right now. i know my body needed the food but i just seriously hate myself at the moment.",
"just need reassurance that it was ok too eat that.. im 18, not in recovery and no one rly knows ab my ed besides from best friend who doesn't go my school. decided last night too try and eat more structured; but an amount im more comfortable with because ive got alot of work too do in school and have been feeling abit happier so its easier too eat. ive been following an almost completely vegan diet for a few months but probs not for the right reasons. today one of my friends offered me a cookie she baked not vg and i made an excuse at first to not eat it but later at lunch she was persistsnt she wanted me too try one and i felt bad so said yes. tried abit, hid rest in bag. changed mind amp; ended up bloody eating it without trying too think too much. but now im just kinda panicking amp; feel uncomfortable because it wasnt in my plan amp; i dont know whats in it or the cals or anything i feel like i can feel the fat seeping into my stomach. like i just wish i hadnt ate it. it tasted good and its nice too not miss out again but its just so uncomfortable and i feel guilty about it my stomach feels warm and uncomfortable af. ik if this would have happened a few weeks ago when i was deeper in my ed and restricting more i would have been mortified but since ive sort of started feeling and eating abit differently not recovery but idk im not tooo stressed over it. it just feels wrong. should i have ate it or not? i cant really justify either.",
"shout out to my droopy skin brothers and sisters. anyone else lost so much weight they have tons of loose skin? how do you feel about it? does it make you proud self conscious both? i have so much of it on every part of my body except my collarbones, feet and hands wrists, and i have mixed feelings about it. i'm embarrassed when i go out in public in a short sleeveless t shirt and feel like people are staring at my upper arms waving in the wind and when i go running i always wear yoga pants under my shorts so no one will be grossed out at my thighs that keep moving after i've stopped. i tend to wear baggy pants and long sleeved shirts for the same reason. i'm constantly aware that people might realize i've lost this weight in a really unhealthy way, and judge me. i'm also secretly in love with it. it's a sign of my progress. i wont mention my numbers here for fear of being deleted, but it's substantial. not to hijack my own thread, but this is related so i'll add it here. do you have a chest other parts if you know, you know that deflated and sank? does it make you feel like no one of your preferred sexual partner gender could find you attractive? do you have trouble being naked in front of your s o because you feel like there's no way they could want to look at you? how has it affected that part of your life? it's really, really hard for me. i can't help but think my body is disgusting. my s o has no problem with the way i look. he tells me all day every day that i'm beautiful. he loved me at my highest weight and he loves me now at my lowest. he hates what this illness has done to my mental state, but to him i'm still physically attractive. your thoughts?",
"is it possible too still have an ed if things like this happen. for instance when im deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours amp; thoughts; and theres a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot or a normal amount. and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging. sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i dont really care. or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kinda binged but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then. literally within days of eachother. it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy 'normal' brain and eating. the thoughts r still there just quieter and i dont act on them as much dont have the energy or just dont care enough tbh. the normal eating with little guilt not because it was safe foods or id compensated just genuinley alright w eating it only lasts from about maybe a meal, sometimes a day or at most a week. but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally. its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction, trying too make it worse than last time. but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns. i dont choose too im sure but its so frustrating. im not ready too recover or eat feel normal for good but i also feel i cant consistently restrict and its so frustrating. i cant restrict like i used too and miss how i looked. but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting. its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a 'pure ed' in my head; binge restrict cycles, pure restriction, over exercising, purging, im just constantly going between them all and i hate it. idk. just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined. is this even an ed. ugh",
"what's the alternative to a meal plan?. i've been following healthy meal plans with balanced structured portions for years now. and i used to eat very normally before the onset of my illness. i am perfectly aware of what normal eating looks like. i could draw a meal plan on the spot myself and prescribe it to others. i could write a book on normal, healthy, balanced, structured meals. problem is, it does f ck all for curing my mind it only exacerbates my obsessive tendencies around food and it never satisfies me on top of that. it always feels like restriction. at least with my restriction i can daydream of the day where i finally will be able to eat everything i want. following ""structured meal plans"" just feels like misery, all the time, forever. i can't fathom doing that for the rest of my life i'd rather take my own life at some point. literally. not joking. my therapist actually said to me that i will never be able to go back to what i was pre ed because that intuitiveness around food is gone forever, so at this point i should just follow a meal plan so that at least i don't die. and when he said that, i cried. i felt so lost and hopeless. and i'm so frustrated that no one seems to understand. meal plans seem to be the golden treatment and if you're not okay with them then everyone treats you like you're actually refusing meal plans because you have some other deep rooted psychological issue, like you're scared of giving up control, you're scared of feeling full or whatever, and in reality meal plans do satisfy you but you wanna use binges to fill your inner emptiness...after years of this bullshit i just roll my eyes and yawn. i'm tired. but...what is the alternative? i wanna recover. but i know that if i truly, deeply, sincerely let myself eat whatever i want, whenever i want, however much i want, without restrictions and limits, i would just...eat everything, all the time, forever.",
"so, so cold. looking for advice here. i'm freezing cold all the time, and i'm really tired of it. my hands and feet are constantly like ice cubes. i wear a heavy jacket, gloves and a hat when i go to the grocery store because they're always arctic like temperatures when everyone else is in shorts and t shirts. i take so many hot baths i'm turning into that creature in 'the shape of water,' and i should buy stock in the company that makes my favorite hot tea. i know if i ate more and i'd be warmer, but i find that impossible. does anyone have ways they keep warm that i haven't thought of? i could really use suggestions.",
"do you all see a dietitian?. i'm currently relapsed. have had anorexia for almost nine years now. i saw a dietitian from ages 13 2 and it helped sometimes but other times it made me more obsessive exchanges and being weighed triggered tf out of me. i could tell by her expression whether i gained or not and she would get mad at me if i lost weight even if i did exactly what she said to do. i was also never allowed to try intuitive eating. also it's super expensive. i was seeing her twice a week, totally 14 2 . my therapist alone is 95. for those who aren't seeing a dietitian, how is it going? how do you know that you're doing well? i tried the ""all in"" method last year and it was fine at first but led to binging and then i relapsed. i really don't want to follow a strict meal plan so i'm thinking it might be easiest to give myself some basic guidelines, like 3 meals and 3 snacks minimum. then hopefully some hunger cues will come back and i can try adjust accordingly. eta: i should've titled this ""how do i know how much what to eat without a dietitian and gauge my progress."" i don't see myself ever really recovering but i need to gain weight like yesterday.",
"how do you deal with a triggering partner?. i think my husband has some kind of eating disorder in the way that he eats insane amounts of food. usually he does it when i am at work... i get to clean all his food mess too, but that's a different issue. i work usually only 2 days he smokes weed at night and binges when i fall asleep. i see these massive binges wrappers, pots mess everywhere, missing food and i use it to justify binging myself, i purge though. i have even been really strict about the food we buy, nothing really snacky or tasty, lots of fruits and vegetables, but he will gorge on bacon bits and a bag of shredded cheese, things i use in small quantities to make my salads and vegetables more enjoyable. i ordered a bunch of junk food off of amazon.. i have dark plans for it. just coming home to the mess i have to clean and knowing he binged so hard makes me feel justified doing this.",
"it is 3am. i just canceled a doctor's appointment for later this morning so i can finish binging and purging and get some freaking sleep before work. i also don't want to be weighed and have my gain acknowledged. or yelled at.. i'm sad. i did so well transitioning out of residential and did the best i have ever done in iop. i had a good month but am fully relapsing, b p every single day and gaining so much weight. it's a gi doc and my primary already yelled at me for ed thoughts and i cant imagine being shamed again. i'm so sad. i had some period of normalcy. please dont ever take any moment of normalcy for granted when you have it.",
"talked to my husband last night.. he'd like me to be a higher weight. i'm not trying to attract anyone, so why is that idea so terrifying?",
"i'm slipping. i'm back, changed accounts but i'm back i'm slipping back into not eating and drinking too much diet coke and ignoring everything, fuucckkk",
